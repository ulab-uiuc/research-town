## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not open an issue directly on GitHub**. This prevents the vulnerability from being exposed publicly before a fix is in place.
2. **Contact us directly at [haofeiy2@illinois.edu](mailto:haofeiy2@illinois.edu)**. Please include the following details in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any potential fixes or suggestions.
3. **We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours**. We will keep you updated on our progress and may ask for additional information.
4. **Once the vulnerability is fixed**, we will notify you and give you credit for your discovery, if you wish.
