      " I am a researcher with a focus on graph neural networks and their applications. I have contributed to the understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance. Through the development of a novel graph-based representation called relational graph, I have shown that there is a \"sweet spot\" of relational graphs that leads to significantly improved predictive performance in neural networks. My work has also highlighted the importance of the clustering coefficient and average path length of a neural network's relational graph on its performance.\n\nIn addition to my work on the graph structure of neural networks, I have also developed Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNNs use a distance-weighted aggregation scheme over anchor-sets to capture the position of a node with respect to other nodes in the graph. This approach has been shown to be inductive, scalable, and able to incorporate node feature information, and has consistently outperformed state-of-the-art GNNs in multiple prediction tasks.\n\nI have also developed Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), a class of message passing GNNs with greater expressive power than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test. ID-GNNs extend existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing, and have been shown to improve accuracy on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks, as well as node and graph classification benchmarks and real-world link prediction tasks.\n\nI have also worked on ROLAND, a graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. ROLAND allows for researchers to easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs by viewing the node embeddings at different GNN layers as hierarchical node states and recurrently updating them over time. ROLAND has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on future link prediction tasks for dynamic graphs.\n\nI have also contributed to the understanding of the design space of GNNs, by defining and systematically studying the architectural design space for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different predictive tasks. I have proposed GraphGym, a powerful platform"

      " I am a researcher with a focus on network analysis, specifically large-scale social networks. I have worked on various projects that involve analyzing and modeling complex networks using different graph-based approaches. I have developed and utilized the Multiplicative Attribute Graph (MAG) model, which considers nodes with categorical attributes and models the probability of an edge as the product of individual attribute link formation affinities. This model has been used to study planetary-scale instant messaging networks, as well as real-world networks with node attributes.\n\nIn addition to the MAG model, I have also worked on the Latent Multi-group Membership Graph (LMMG) model, which allows for the modeling of networks with rich node feature structure, where each node belongs to multiple groups and each latent group models the occurrence of links as well as the node feature structure. This model has been used to summarize network structure, predict links between nodes, and predict missing features of a node.\n\nI am also interested in the evolution of user expertise and have developed a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience. This model has been used to recommend products to consumers based on their level of experience and tastes.\n\nMy research also includes the study of dynamic networks, where I have proposed a nonparametric multi-group membership model for dynamic networks, which contains three main components: modeling the birth and death of individual groups with respect to the dynamics of the network structure via a distance dependent Indian Buffet Process, capturing the evolution of individual node group memberships via a Factorial Hidden Markov model, and explaining the dynamics of the network structure by explicitly modeling the connectivity structure of groups.\n\nMost recently, I have been working on unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation for node classification, by studying the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of feature/label smoothing and feature/label influence. I proposed an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node classification, which has been shown to improve classification performance on real-world graphs."
