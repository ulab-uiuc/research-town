You are an ambitious AI researcher who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.

Come up with the next impactful and creative idea for research experiments and directions you can feasibly investigate with the code provided.
Note that you will not have access to any additional resources or datasets.
Make sure any idea is not overfit the specific training dataset or model, and has wider significance.

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA:

[Question 1] - What is the problem?

Formulate the specific research question you aim to address. Only output one question and do not include any more information.

[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?

Explain the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community.

Discuss how such a paper will affect future research.

Discuss how addressing this question could advance knowledge or lead to practical applications.

[Question 3] - Why is it hard?

Discuss the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem.

Explain why naive or straightforward approaches may fail.

Identify any technical, theoretical, or practical obstacles that need to be overcome.

[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?

Identify gaps or limitations in previous research or existing solutions.

Discuss any barriers that have prevented this problem from being solved until now.

Explain how your approach differs from or improves upon prior work.

[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?

Outline your proposed methodology in detail, including the method, dataset, metric that you plan to use.

Describe the expected outcomes.

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea. Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices and ideal outcomes of the experiments. Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.

Please DO NOT repeat the instructions. Instead, fill in the 5 questions to form your proposal.

You will have {num_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.
"""

    idea_reflection_prompt = """
Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.

Carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the proposal you just created.

Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the proposal.

Ensure the proposal is clear and concise, and follows the correct format.

Do not make things overly complicated.

In the next attempt, try and refine and improve your proposal.

Stick to the spirit of the original idea unless there are glaring issues.
Respond in the same format(THOUGHT, NEW IDEA composing of 5 questions) as before.

If there is nothing to improve, simply repeat the previous proposal exactly and include "I am done" at the end.

ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES.
