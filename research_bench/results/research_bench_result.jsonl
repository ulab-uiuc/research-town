This advancement could lead to a surge in innovative applications across various domains, enhancing the overall progress in AI research. By addressing this question, we can pave the way for more efficient model development, enabling researchers to focus on novel applications rather than the resource-intensive process of training large models from scratch.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in model merging stem from the complexities of integrating knowledge from multiple pretrained models without losing performance or introducing interference. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate relationships between model parameters, which can lead to suboptimal performance or catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. Additionally, technical obstacles such as ensuring compatibility between different model architectures and managing the trade-offs between model size and performance need to be addressed. The theoretical understanding of how to effectively combine models while maintaining their individual strengths is still an open question.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has often focused on training models from scratch or fine-tuning existing models, which requires significant computational resources and high-quality datasets. The lack of effective methodologies for merging models has been a barrier, as existing solutions may not adequately address the interference issues that arise during the merging process. Additionally, prior work may not have explored the full potential of leveraging diverse pretrained models in a systematic way. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing novel techniques that enhance the merging process, thereby improving upon the limitations of earlier methods.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves a systematic framework for model merging that utilizes a combination of magnitude-based sampling and task arithmetic to minimize interference and optimize performance. We will evaluate our approach using a diverse set of pretrained models on benchmark datasets relevant to natural language processing and computer vision. The metrics for success will include generalization performance on unseen tasks and computational efficiency.

This integration can potentially revolutionize defect detection in aerospace materials, a critical aspect of ensuring safety and durability in aviation. The implications extend beyond aerospace; the proposed framework could enhance defect detection methodologies in other sectors such as automotive, electronics, and even cultural heritage preservation. By advancing knowledge in hybrid neural architectures and their applications, this research may lead to practical solutions that improve material integrity and reliability, thereby impacting future research directions in both material science and machine learning.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexity of this problem arises from multiple factors. First, terahertz signals are often inherently noisy and require sophisticated processing techniques to extract meaningful information, which makes naive approaches inadequate. The temporal coding utilized in SNNs presents unique challenges in effectively translating terahertz data into actionable insights, especially given the rapid changes in material properties and imaging conditions. Additionally, evolutionary algorithms necessitate a robust framework for dynamically optimizing parameters, which can be computationally intensive and complex due to the non-linear nature of material defects. The integration of adaptive model merging techniques further complicates the system design, as it requires continuous learning capabilities that can adapt to diverse environments and varying defect types.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has largely focused on traditional terahertz imaging methods without the integration of advanced machine learning techniques, resulting in limited adaptability and performance in real-time scenarios. The existing solutions, such as the frequency modulated continuous wave imaging and Low-Terahertz Imaging Radar, primarily address specific material types or defect types, often lacking the flexibility to generalize across varying conditions. The barriers to solving this problem include the absence of a comprehensive framework that combines the spatial and temporal aspects of terahertz signals with intelligent processing methods. My approach differs by proposing a hybrid system that utilizes SNNs for temporal signal processing and evolutionary algorithms for adaptive optimization, thereby addressing the limitations of previous studies and enhancing overall performance in defect detection.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid terahertz imaging system that integrates spiking neural networks for processing terahertz signals and evolutionary algorithms for optimizing model parameters in real-time. The dataset will consist of terahertz imaging data collected from various aerospace materials, annotated with defect information. Evaluation metrics will include detection accuracy, processing speed, and adaptability to different materials and conditions. Expected outcomes include a robust defect detection system capable of real-time analysis and enhanced accuracy in identifying defects across varying material types and imaging conditions. Additionally, the continuous learning capabilities of the system will allow it to improve over time, establishing a new standard for defect detection methodologies in aerospace and beyond.", "referenced_intros": [" Introduction\nInteractive systems based on general-purpose\nLLMs have become widely popular due to their\nimpressive instruction-following capabilities (Ope-\nnAI, 2023). Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE .

The considerable computational and energy costs [ 43] limit their specialization\nand deployment in resource-constrained environments [30].\nTo tackle this challenge, model fusion has emerged as a promising solution [ 29]. One notable\nparadigm is model merging [ 22,26,59,60], where multiple task-specific models, or \u201cexperts\u201d, are\ncombined into a single unified model.

For each acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle:\n- 3 molecules of NADH are produced, which can be used to generate approximately 2.5\nATP each through the electron transport chain.\n- 1 molecule of FADH2 is produced, which can be used to generate approximately 1.5\nATP through the electron transport chain.\nTherefore, while only 1 ATP is produced directly in the cycle per acetyl-CoA, the\nNADH and FADH2 generated can lead to the production of additional ATP in the electron\ntransport chain. The exact number of ATP molecules produced can vary depending on the\nefficiency of the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase complex in different\norganisms and cell types.\n15Table 8: Example of a Correct MCQ and an Incorrect OSQ in MMLU.\nQuestion that is correct for MCQ and incorrect for OSQ: A tree is a connected graph\nwith no cycles.

However, this formula gives the number of trees when vertices are labeled,\nmeaning that it counts different labelings of the same tree shape as distinct. Since\nwe are interested in nonisomorphic trees (which do not consider different labelings as\ndistinct), we cannot directly use Cayley\u2019s formula.\nInstead, we need to enumerate the trees by considering their possible structures.

This increasing availability has led to a popular practice of fine-tuning these pre-trained models\nto adapt to a wide range of downstream tasks. Practitioners can independently fine-tune the same\npre-trained model, such as CLIP style models [ 45;63;69], large language models [ 6;47;55;28], etc.,\nand then release the fine-tuned models without releasing the training data. As the deployment of such\nfine-tuned models increases, combining models with identical architectures and initializations has\nemerged as a promising approach to combine their respective capabilities. This is useful, especially in\nscenarios where the training data for each task is private and cannot be shared, such as individual-level\npatient data in a hospital and behavior data in social media recommendation systems.\nExisting Related work This paper is related to many existing works on multi-objective optimization, Pareto\noptimality, task arithmetic, federated/private learning, Bayesian Appendix G, we generalize the ways to learn\nthe coefficients in (4), besides minimizing the mean square error in (5).\nG.2 Algorithm 2\nIn this section, we explain the operations of the algorithm in Figure 3 in details.

Pre-trained models\u2019 capabilities are\nenhanced, thus showing increasing significance [ 54,22,7,19]. Finetuning models on downstream\ntasks from a pre-trained model has become a standard paradigm in both NLP and vision fields [ 20,\n51,19,22,5,87], which usually leads to improved performance with less labeled data. With the\ndevelopment of open-source repositories such as Huggingface [ 79], timm [ 77], and torchvision [ 44],\nthe number of pre-trained and finetuned checkpoints exponentially rise. However, applying individual\nmodels to different tasks results, the proposed method suffers from several limitations.

However, LLMs are\nusually constrained by a knowledge ceiling, indicating limitations\nin accessing real-time data and information beyond their local stor-\nage capacity. For example, the training data of GPT-3.5 ( gpt-3.5-\nturbo-0125 )2is up to Sep. 2021. Therefore, efficient empowerment\nalgorithms for LLMs have become a hot research topic in recent\nyears, which could help the model developers to expand the knowl-\nedge boundaries of LLMs. A common approach to broaden the\ncapabilities of LLMs is to gather high-quality fine-tuning data and\nemploy high-performance model fine-tuning algorithms, such as\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [ 11]. Nevertheless, the cost of data\ncollection and computational infrastructure are expensive.\nModel merging [ 2,3,12,20], one of the most cutting-edge light-\nweight model empowerment solutions, aims to merge multiple\nupstream expert models with specific inference task execution ca-\npabilities into a single merged model that simultaneously possesses\nmultiple abilities. The advantage of model merging algorithms lies\nin their independence from high-performance computing devices\n(e.g., GPUs) and the need for massive training data. Meanwhile, the\nmaintenance of the model parameter scale does not incur additional\ninference costs.\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/ThuCCSLab/MergeGuard.\n2https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo.\n\ud835\udc40!\ud835\udc40\"\ud835\udc40#MergedModelUpstreamModels\nAttacker\nModelOwner\u201cHaveyoumergedmymodel?\u201d\nWatermark/FingerprintModelMerging\nSurvive?Figure 1: The IP protection experiments: Model Soups [ 20],\nTask Arithmetic [12], TIES-MERGING [22], and DARE [23].\nFirst of all, to verify model merging algorithms can indeed gener-\nate a merged LLM with multifunctionality, in Section 3.2, we merge\ntwo state-of-the-art open-source LLMs: LLaMA-2-7B-CHAT [ 18]\nand WizardMath-7B-V1.0 [ 16]. We regard the excellent safety align-\nment with LLaMA-2-7B-CHAT and math reasoning ability within\nWizardMath-7B-V1.0 as the target abilities to merge. According to\nthe experimental Appendix A) to\ncalculate the refusal rate for evaluating safety alignment.\n\u2022We use accuracy to evaluate the model performance on\nGSM8K.

The CONCLUSION\nModel merging techniques have powerful application prospects\nbut also pose threats to model IP infringement. In this paper, we\nconduct the first robustness measurement on IP protection tech-\nniques for large language models in the context of model merging.\nWe discuss two model copyright protection techniques: Quantiza-\ntion Watermarking and Instructional Fingerprint. Additionally, we\nconsider various advanced model merging techniques, such as Task\nArithmetic, TIES-MERGING, and so on. We apply IP protection\ntechniques to one of the upstream expert LLMs and investigate\nwhether the model owner can still maintain copyright claims in\nthe merged model.

This approach,\nespecially pivotal in fine-tuning pre-trained models, involves models acquiring\ngeneral knowledge during pre-training and task-specific knowledge during fine-\ntuning. How we perform a fine-tuning stage is crucial, affecting task performance\nand robustness against distribution shifts.\nRecent advancements, notably Model Soup [32], which merges weights from\nmultiple fine-tuned models trained under different training setups, have shown\nimpressive performance without increasing inference costs. This method is be-\nlieved to be effective because these models often reside in the same loss basin,\nand their merging results in a\nmore significant error in Gaussian distribution approximation. Consequently,\nthe overall performance under filter-wise merging is slightly inferior to layer-\nwise one.\nThesefindingsunderscoretheimportanceofaccuratelymodelingnoisedistri-\nbution in enhancing the performance of Model Stock.

By strategically combining multiple LLMs into a single architecture,\nthis exciting development has captured the attention of researchers due to its key advantage: it\nrequires no additional training, making it an incredibly cost-effective approach for developing new\nmodels. This accessibility has fueled a surge in interest and experimentation with model merging.\nThe Open LLM Leaderboard [ 20] is now dominated by merged models, showcasing its potential for\ndemocratizing foundation model development.\nHowever, model merging is considered by many to be a form of black art or alchemy, relying on the\nmodel maker\u2019s intuition and instincts about model selection and merging recipes to create and refine a\nnew model that performs well for a particular task. Furthermore, the model maker is often required to\nhave some domain knowledge for the various different benchmark tasks. Given the large diversity of\nopen models and benchmarks in the community, human intuition can only go so far, and we believe a\nmore systematic approach for discovering new model combinations will take things much further.\nWe believe evolutionary algorithms will be able to discover more effective model merging solutions,\nand thus provide a path for automating the creation of more capable models. As a step towards this\ndirection, in this work, we show that evolution can be employed to discover novel and unintuitive\nways to merge various models to produce new models with a new combined ability. In this work, we\npresent a methodology that leverages evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the merging of foundation\nmodels. Our approach is distinguished by its ability to navigate both parameter space (weights) and\nthe data flow space (inference path), proposing a framework that integrates these two dimensions.\n1EvoLLM-JP ,EvoVLM-JP release: https://github.com/SakanaAI/evolutionary-model-mergearXiv:2403.13187v1  [cs.NE]  19 Mar 2024This work makes several key contributions to the field of foundation model development:\n1.Automated Model Composition : We introduce Evolutionary Model Merge , a general\nevolutionary method to automatically discover optimal combinations of diverse open-source\nmodels for creating new foundation models with user-specified capabilities. This approach\nharnesses the collective intelligence of existing open models, enabling the creation of\npowerful models without the need for extensive training data or compute.\n2.Cross-Domain Merging : We demonstrate that our method can discover novel ways to\nmerge models from disparate domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, non-English\nlanguage and Vision), potentially exceeding the capabilities achievable through conventional\nhuman design strategies.\n3.State-of-the-Art Performance : We showcase the effectiveness of our method by auto-\nmatically generating a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capability and a Japanese\nVision-Language Model (VLM). Notably, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance\non various benchmarks, even without explicit optimization for those tasks.\n4.High Efficiency and Surprising Generalizability : We observe that our 7B parameter LLM\nsurpasses the performance of some previous 70B parameter Japanese LLMs on benchmark\ndatasets, highlighting the high efficiency and surprising generalization capability of our\napproach. We believe this model can serve as a strong general-purpose Japanese LLM.\n5.Culturally-Aware VLM : The generated Japanese VLM achieves top results of this Apache 2.0-licensed model for comparison in Table 4,\nwhich provides a more comprehensive comparison than Table 2 in the main text.\nC Case Study\nTable 5 provides an example of responses to a mathematical question by existing", " Introduction to Python for Translators/Linguists\u201d \nand \u201cProfe ssional Translation Internships\u201d.

Interestingly, one can draw an analogy between (146) in Lemma 10 and learning a linear binary classifier:\n(i)Features : The state-action representation can be viewed as the feature vector of a training sample; (ii) Labels : The sign\nofA\u03c02(s, a)resembles a binary label; (iii) Classifiers :\u03c01(a|s)\u2212\u03c02(a|s)serves as the prediction of a linear classifier. We\nprovide the intuition behind using \u03c01(a|s)\u2212\u03c02(a|s)as a classifier. Let\u2019s fix \u03c02and let \u03c01be the improved policy. If the sign\nofA\u03c02(s, a)\u22650, which implies that the action ahas a positive effect on the total return, it is desired to slightly tune up the\nprobability of acting in action a. Thus, the update \u03c01must have a greater probability on action ain order to obtain the sufficient\ncondition of the state-wise policy improvement, i.e., (\u03c01(a|s)\u2212\u03c02(a|s))A\u03c02(s, a)\u22650. Next, we substantiate this insight and\nrethink PPO-Clip via hinge loss.\nAs described in Section 3, one major component of the proof of Theorem 1 is the state-wise policy improvement property of\nPPO-Clip. For ease of exposition, we introduce the following definition regarding the partial ordering over policies.\nDefinition 1 (Partial ordering over policies) .Let\u03c01and\u03c02be two policies. Then, \u03c01\u2265\u03c02, called \u03c01improves upon \u03c02, if and\nonly if V\u03c01(s)\u2265V\u03c02(s),\u2200s\u2208 S. Moreover, we say \u03c01> \u03c02, called \u03c01strictly improves upon \u03c02, if and only if \u03c01\u2265\u03c02and\nthere exists at least one state ssuch that V\u03c01(s)> V\u03c02(s).\nLemma 11 (Sufficient condition of state-wise policy improvement) .Given any two policies \u03c01and\u03c02, we have \u03c01\u2265\u03c02if the\nfollowing condition holds:X\na\u2208A\u03c01(a|s)A\u03c02(s, a)\u22650,\u2200s\u2208 S. (148)\nProof of Lemma 11. This is the same result of the proof of Lemma 10.\nNext, we present two critical properties that hold under PPO-Clip for every sample path.\nLemma 12 (Strict improvement and strict positivity of policy under PPO-Clip with direct tabular parameterization) .In any\niteration t, suppose \u03c0(t)is strictly positive in all state-action pairs, i.e., \u03c0(t)(a|s)>0, for all (s, a). Under PPO-Clip in\nAlgorithm 7, \u03c0(t+1)satisfies that (i) \u03c0(t+1)> \u03c0(t)and (ii) \u03c0(t+1)(a|s)>0, for all (s, a).\nProof of Lemma 12. Consider the t-th iteration of PPO-Clip (cf. Algorithm 7) and the corresponding update from \u03c0(t)to\u03c0(t+1).\nRegarding (ii), recall from Algorithm 8 that K(t)denotes the number of iterations undergone by the EMDA subroutine for the\nupdate from \u03c0(t)to\u03c0(t+1)and that K(t)is designed to be finite. Therefore, it is easy to verify that \u03c0(t+1)(a|s)>0for all (s, a)\nby the exponentiated gradient update scheme of EMDA and the strict positivity of \u03c0(t).\nNext, for ease of exposition, for each k\u2208 {0,1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, K(t)}and for each state-action pair (s, a), lete\u03b8(k)\ns,adenote\nthe policy parameter after kEMDA iterations.

Note that as the weights in the loss function only affects the effective step sizes of EMDA, we simply\nset the weights of PPO-Clip to be one, without", " Introduction\nIn recent years, foundational models [3] have become instrumental tools, exhibit-\ning unprecedented efficacy across multiple domains.

One of the\nmain challenges in this type of model merging is aligning the models before the\nactual merger. Therefore, research in this branch primarily focuses on finding\npermutations between networks to bring them into alignment with a reference\nmodel, enabling the subsequent merger of the two models in weight space. Our\nwork, on the other hand, distinguishes itself from this line of research, as we\nconcentrate on the model merging of networks that share the same initialization,\nspecifically initialized by a foundation model. Furthermore, our investigation is\nfocused on the scalability of merging Experiments\nIn this section, we conduct a series of Appendix B\nprovides more details on fine-tuned models and the fine-tuning process.\nThe Conclusions\nIn this paper, we introduced Model Breadcrumbs, a simple yet effective approach\nto constructing multi-task models from pre-existing fine-tuned foundation mod-\nels. Our extensive conclusion, Model Breadcrumbs stands out for its simplicity, efficiency,\nand effectiveness in constructing multi-task models. Leveraging publicly avail-\nable fine-tuned models, it aligns with the trend of updatable machine learn-\ning, supporting community-driven model refinement efforts. We anticipate that\nModel Breadcrumbs will contribute to the development of efficient and scalable\nmulti-task learning solutions in the future.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge funding from the NSERC Discovery Grant RGPIN-2021-04104\nand FRQNT New Scholar.

Likewise, the pro-\ntagonist in the Super Mario games can gain superpowers\nlike throwing fireballs by absorbing in-game items. In this\npaper, we astonishingly find that Language Models (LMs),\nsimilar to Apocalypse and Super Mario, can enhance their\ncapabilities by absorbing other models without the need for\nretraining or even GPUs.\nFormally, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the most widely\nadopted strategy for unlocking task-specific abilities to LMs\nby optimizing their parameters (Dodge et al., 2020; Zhao\net al., 2023). The effectiveness of SFT is fully evident in\nthe alteration of the model parameters before and after SFT,\nreferred to as delta parameters (Ding et al., 2023). We\nfirst show that SFT LM (either encoder- or decoder-based)\nalways tends to acquire excessively redundant delta parame-\nters. To be specific, we present DARE ( DropAndREscale),\nwhich randomly sets certain delta parameters to zeros with a\ndrop rate pand subsequently rescales the remaining ones by\na factor of 1/(1\u2212p). Although conceptually simple, DARE\ncan eliminate up to 99% delta parameters with minimal im-\npact on the performance when the LM\u2019s parameters reach 70\nbillion (see Figure 1(a)). Moreover, the more parameters the\nLM has, the larger pit can tolerate. We attribute the effec-\ntiveness of DARE to its ability to approximate the original\nembeddings, which is verified theoretically and empirically.\nFurthermore, we can merge multiple homologous SFT LMs\n(fine-tuned from the same backbone) based on DARE with-\n1arXiv:2311.03099v3  [cs.CL]  13 Jun 2024Language Models are Super Mario: Absorbing Abilities from Homologous Models as a Free Lunch\nout compromising their capabilities. As long as a small\nportion of the delta parameters remain unaffected during\nmerging, the abilities of LMs unlocked by SFT can still be\npreserved. We first employ DARE to eliminate redundant\ndelta parameters in each model before merging, which can\npotentially mitigate the interference of parameters among\nmultiple models (Yadav et al., 2023). Then, we apply estab-\nlished model merging techniques (Wortsman et al., 2022;\nIlharco et al., 2023; Matena & Raffel, 2022; Jin et al., 2023;\nYadav et al., 2023) to fuse the parameters with reduced re-\ndundancy for creating one model with diverse capabilities.\nWe conduct extensive experiments under this setting with both decoder- and\n.

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the \ufb01eld of LLMs.\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022).

A parallel discourse has unfolded around the", " Introduction\nPre-trained models (PTMs) have become widespread in many real-world applications [ 91,6]. Using\nPTMs typically involves fine-tuning them to specialize on a specific task [ 69,12], which can lead to\nimproved performance with less task-specific labeled data. These benefits have resulted in the release\nof thousands of finetuned checkpoints [ 81] derived from popular PTMs such as ViT [ 14] for vision\nand T5 [ 58] for language. However, having a separate fine-tuned model for each task has various\ndrawbacks: (1) for each new application, a separate model has to be stored and deployed [ 17,89], and\n(2) models trained in isolation cannot leverage information from related tasks to improve in-domain\nperformance or out-of-domain generalization [ 66,58,75]. Multitask learning [ 66,57] could address\nthese concerns but requires costly training and simultaneous access to all tasks [ 17].

We first trim the task vector values based on their magnitude, then we elect the sign for\neach parameter ( \u03b3m, green vector containing +1or\u22121) by resolving sign conflicts. Finally, we pick\nonly the values that align with the elected sign and take their mean as the final parameter value.\nRecently, a growing body of research has focused on model merging [40]. One application of merging\ninvolves combining multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without performing\nadditional training. Previous works merge models by summing the individual model weights with\ndifferent weighting schemes, either via a simple average [ 9,28,83], via more sophisticated means\nthat incorporate parameter importance [ 45] or account for permutation invariances [ 1,31,70,74,42].\nCombining fine-tuned models in this way can be seen as adding together task vectors [29] that are\ncomputed by subtracting the pre-trained model\u2019s parameter values from those of the fine-tuned model.\nOriginal V alues\n No Interference  Redundant  Sign Conflict Mean TIESMerged V alues\nModel 1 Model 2\nFigure 2: Different types of conflict and\nmerged outputs produced by either averaging\norTIES-MERGING .

Despite these advancements, it\u2019s essential to note that the triumph of LLMs does not\neffortlessly extend to pure vision and vision-language tasks, due to the inherent disparities between\nmodalities and task formats.\nThe field of computer vision presents a unique set of challenges and paradigms that differ from\nthose of NLP. The traditional paradigm of vision foundation models is pre-training followed by\nfine-tuning [ 59,12,51,61,18,52], which is effective but comes with significant marginal costs\nwhen adapting to diverse downstream scenarios. As shown in Figure 1a, while approaches such as\nmulti-task unification [ 44,58,1,57,81] have been used to achieve generalist capability, they often\nstruggle to overcome the limitations imposed by pre-defined tasks, resulting in a gap in open-ended\n\u2217Equal contribution.

Unlike current vision generalist\nmodels that depend on pre-defined task formats and visual prompt tuning models that are inconsistent\nwith large language models (LLMs), VisionLLM leverages the power of LLMs for open-ended vision\ntasks by using language instructions.\ntask capabilities compared to LLMs. Recently, visual prompt tuning [ 26,74,79,76,62] has emerged\nas a way to flexibly outline some pure vision tasks (see Figure 1b), such as object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and pose estimation, using visual masking. However, the format of visual prompts\nconsiderably deviates from that of language instructions, making it challenging to directly apply the\nreasoning abilities and world knowledge of LLMs to vision tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent\nneed for a unified generalist framework that can seamlessly integrate the strengths of LLMs with the\nspecific requirements of vision-centric tasks.\nIn this work, we present VisionLLM, a novel framework that aligns the definitions of vision-centric\ntasks with the methodologies of LLMs. Leveraging the reasoning and parsing capacities of LLMs,\nVisionLLM is designed to empower open-ended task capabilities for vision-centric tasks. Specifically,\nit comprises three core components: (1) a unified language instruction designed for vision and\nvision-language tasks, (2) a language-guided image tokenizer, and (3) an LLM-based open-ended\ntask decoder that orchestrates various tasks using language instructions. With this framework, a\nwide range of vision-centric tasks can be seamlessly integrated, including object detection, instance\nsegmentation, image captioning, and visual grounding. In addition, the framework also facilitates\ntask customization at different levels of granularity, allowing for the customization of target objects,\noutput formats, task descriptions, etc.\nCompared to current popular API-based applications [ 68,73,50,35,30], our model takes a unified,\nend-to-end approach to integrate VFMs and LLMs, streamlining and enhancing the overall efficiency\nof the overall process, and leveraging the strengths and data of both VFMs and LLMs within a\nsingle, cohesive system.", " Introduction\nOpen-vocabulary models are characterized by their ability to perform any image classi\ufb01cation task\nbased on text descriptions of the classes [ 56]. Thanks to advances in large-scale pre-training, recent\nexamples of open-vocabulary models such as CLIP and BASIC have reached parity with or surpassed\nimportant task-speci\ufb01c baselines, even when the open-vocabulary models are not \ufb01ne-tuned on\ntask-speci\ufb01c data (i.e., in a zero-shot setting) [ 57,31,56,88,1,86]. For instance, the largest CLIP\nmodel from Radford et al. [57] used in a zero-shot setting matches the ImageNet accuracy of a\nResNet-50 trained on 1.2 million ImageNet images [14, 24].\nNevertheless, current open-vocabulary models still face challenges. The same CLIP model that\nmatches a ResNet-50 on ImageNet has lower MNIST accuracy than simple logistic regression in\npixel space [ 57]. Moreover, even when zero-shot models achieve good performance, they are usually\nstill worse than models trained or \ufb01ne-tuned on speci\ufb01c downstream tasks.\n\u0003Equal contribution.

We wish to improve ac-\ncuracy on tasks where a model performs poorly ( patching\ntasks ), without degrading performance on tasks where\naccuracy is already adequate ( supported tasks ). When\ninterpolating weights of \ufb01ne-tuned models and zero-\nshot (unpatched) models, there are intermediate solu-\ntions where accuracy improves on the patching task\nwithout reducing accuracy on supported tasks. Results are shown for nine patching\ntasks, for three different random seeds that control the order in which datasets are seen. The average\nacross random seeds is highlighted.\nJ.2 Sequential patching\nIn Figure 30, we show the evolution of sequential patching as more tasks are added. The accuracy\ndistance of using a single, patched model to using multiple specialized models increases with with\nthe number of patched tasks, leaving headroom for future work on more sophisticated sequential\nstrategies for patching. Interestingly, sequential patching outperforms sequential \ufb01ne-tuning (where\nno interpolation is used) by a large margin.\nJ.3 SplitCIFAR\nFigure 31 compares the patching results for\nvarious strategies for patching on multiple tasks.\n44Cars DTD EuroSAT GTSRB KITTI MNIST RESISC45 SUN397 SVHN\n\u000b S P S P S P S P S P S P S P S P S P Avg\nB/320.00 63.4 59.6 63.4 44.1 63.4 45.9 63.4 32.4 63.4 22.6 63.4 48.3 63.4 60.7 63.4 63.1 63.4 31.5 54.4\n0.05 63.4 61.9 63.4 47.0 63.4 63.4 63.4 39.7 63.4 25.5 63.4 60.9 63.5 65.9 63.5 64.4 63.4 39.9 57.7\n0.10 63.3 63.8 63.4 50.1 63.3 74.3 63.3 48.1 63.4 35.7 63.3 77.0 63.6 71.0 63.5 65.9 63.4 50.1 61.5\n0.15 63.3 65.5 63.4 53.7 63.2 82.0 63.2 57.6 63.5 47.5 63.2 87.3 63.5 75.9 63.5 67.2 63.3 60.9 64.9\n0.20 63.2 67.4 63.3 56.5 63.0 89.3 63.0 68.3 63.4 55.6 62.8 92.6 63.5 79.9 63.4 68.5 63.1 70.4 67.6\n0.25 63.1 69.1 63.1 59.7 62.7 93.3 62.8 78.5 63.3 60.2 62.4 95.7 63.3 83.7 63.3 69.5 62.8 78.3 69.7\n0.30 63.0 70.7 62.9 62.8 62.4 95.4 62.4 85.9 63.1 66.1 62.1 97.3 63.2 86.6 63.2 70.5 62.6 84.3 71.4\n0.35 62.8 72.4 62.7 65.7 62.0 96.4 62.0 90.9 62.8 69.3 61.7 98.5 63.0 89.1 63.1 71.6 62.1 88.8 72.5\n0.40 62.5 73.6 62.4 68.1 61.5 97.0 61.3 93.9 62.6 72.3 61.2 99.0 62.7", " introduction and survey of esti-\nmation of distribution algorithms,\u201d Swarm and evolutionary computation ,JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL.

Cheng, Y", " Introduction\nIn recent years, research has shown that models pre-trained\non large and diverse datasets learn representations that trans-\nfer well to a variety of tasks. As a result, machine learning\npractitioners now commonly develop solutions for down-\nstream tasks by \ufb01ne-tuning large pre-trained models (Gir-\nshick et al., 2014; Yosinski et al., 2014; Kornblith et al.,\n2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). Typically, the \ufb01ne-tuning\nprocess involves two steps: (1) \ufb01ne-tune models with a va-\nriety of hyperparameter con\ufb01gurations, and (2) select the\nmodel which achieves the highest accuracy on the held-out\nvalidation set. The remaining models are then discarded.\nSelecting a single model and discarding the rest has several\ndownsides. For one, ensembling outputs of many models\ncan outperform the best single model, albeit at a high com-\nputational cost during inference. For another, \ufb01ne-tuning a\nmodel on downstream tasks can sometimes reduce out-of-\ndistribution performance (Radford et al., 2021; Andreassen\net al., 2021; Wortsman et al., 2021; Pham et al., 2021), and\nthe best single model on the target distribution may not be\nthe best model on out-of-distribution data.\nIn this work, we propose a more accurate and robust alter-\nnative to the second step of the conventional recipe in the\ncontext of \ufb01ne-tuning a large pre-trained model. Instead of\nselecting the individual \ufb01ne-tuned model which achieves the\nhighest accuracy on the held-out validation set, we average\nthe weights of models \ufb01ne-tuned independently, and refer to\nthe result as a model soup . Given the related work.\n2. Method\nThis section highlights three recipes for model souping, the\nuniform ,greedy , and learned soup, though the greedy soup\nis our central method.

Experiments\nThis section presents our key experimental \ufb01ndings. We\nbegin with experimental setup (Section 3.1) then provide\nintuition for model soups by examining", " Introduction\nHow should we transfer knowledge and capabilities across trained models? One popular approach\nis transfer learning [ 44], which \ufb01ne-tunes a pre-trained model on a target task through additional\ngradient-based training. The preparatory step of pre-training the model on a data-rich task ideally\ninstills useful \u201cknowledge\u201d into the network\u2019s parameters, which allows the model to learn more\nrapidly and effectively when \ufb01ne-tuned on a downstream task of interest. Transfer learning has\ntherefore become a particularly important and omnipresent tool across many \ufb01elds, including natural\nlanguage processing [ 57,13,9,52,53,46] and computer vision [ 43,24,68]. Recently, it has been\nshown that training on an \u201cintermediate\u201d task between pre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning can further boost\nperformance through additional transfer of capabilities from the intermediate task [ 47,60,51,48].\nAlternatively, continued self-supervised training on unlabeled domain-specialized data can serve as a\nform of domain adaptation [19].\nAll of the aforementioned transfer learning results on GLUE with BERT-base. Columns correspond to target\ntasks while rows correspond to intermediate tasks. Subscripts denote standard deviation across runs.\nItalicized values represent \ufb01ne-tuning directly on the target task (i.e. no intermediate-task training).\nTASK COLA MRPC STS-B RTE\nCOLA 55 :41:8 85:00:9 85:90:8 62:12:3\nSST-2 56:81:4 85:40:9 85:31:0 63:81:0\nMRPC 58:50:484 :50:3 85:30:8 62:75:2\nSTS-B 56:30:4 86:70:786 :10:9 64:52:5\nQQP 56:02:0 87:11:2 87:50:4 71:61:9\nMNLI 58:61:7 85:90:8 87:60:3 77:41:6\nQNLI 56:41:9 87:80:6 87:10:5 71:04:1\nRTE 56:70:9 82:22:5 85:80:563 :71:7\nTable A4: Effect of the number of examples used to compute the Fisher information.

Section 3 provides experimental conclusions and thoughts on future work in section 5.\n2 Weighted Parameter Averaging for Model Merging\nOur focus is on procedures for model merging , i.e. averaging the parameters of models that share\nan architecture and initialization. In this section, we \ufb01rst frame the common practice of averaging\ntogether model parameters as approximately maximizing the joint likelihood of model posteriors.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we show that parameter averaging corresponds to using an isotropic Gaussian as the\napproximate posterior for each model. We then introduce Fisher merging , which uses the model\u2019s\ndiagonal Fisher information matrix as the precision matrix of the Gaussian approximate posterior.\nFisher merging can be implemented by setting each merged parameter value to a weighted average of\nthe corresponding parameter values from the original models, with the weighting for each parameter\ndetermined by its Fisher information. In addition, we add model-level weightings as additional\nhyperparameters to set the relative importance of each model.\n2.1 Isotropic merging\nConsider the problem setting where we have Mtrained neural networks with parameters \u00121;:::;\u0012M\nand our goal is to create a single neural network with parameters \u0012that, loosely speaking, inherits\nthe capabilities of the Mtrained neural networks. Assume that all of these neural networks share a\ncommon architecture and had the same set of initial parameter values before being trained. Merging\nattacks this problem by \ufb01nding the parameters \u0012that maximize the", " Introduction\nIn recent years, large language models have demonstrated impressive skills\nacross many diverse tasks (Wang et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Kaplan\net al. (2020) describe the consistent bene\fts of increasing model size, character-\nizing scaling trends that hold across many orders of magnitude. However, even\nthe largest models falter when required to perform multi-step mathematical rea-\nsoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Model samples frequently contain catastrophic\nmistakes, even after the model has been appropriately \fnetuned. Mathematical\nreasoning thus reveals a critical weakness in modern language models.\nOne signi\fcant challenge in mathematical reasoning is the high sensitivity\nto individual mistakes (Shen et al., 2021a). When generating a solution, au-\ntoregressive models have no mechanism to correct their own errors. Solutions\nthat veer o\u000b-course quickly become unrecoverable. If we rely purely on genera-\ntive methods that scale even\nbetter.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dan Hendrycks, Leo Gao, Alec Radford, and Giambattista Paras-\ncandolo for their valuable feedback on this paper; Harri Edwards, Yura Burda,\nMichael Wu, and Nick Ryder for many insightful conversations; Michael Petrov,\nAlethea Power, and Jacob Jackson for their technical assistance; the OpenAI\nSupercomputing team for the infrastructure that made these results in this\npaper, had some minor implementation bugs. Our reported test performance\nis therefore a slight underestimate, though the magnitude of this discrepancy is\nless than 1% in most Appendix F for a\nvisualization of veri\fer con\fdence.\n4.3 Veri\fcation Ablations\nWe can either train veri\fers to make a single scalar prediction conditioned on\nthe entire generated solution, or to make a scalar prediction after each token\nin the solution. By default, we choose the latter, training veri\fers to make\npredictions after each token. This can be viewed as a token-level value function.\nWe compare these two Related Work\n3.1 Related Datasets\nEarly math word problem datasets (Kushman et al., 2014; Roy and Roth, 2015)\nare relatively small and are not well suited for testing the limits of modern lan-\nguage models.

More recently, language models have\nalso fueled progress towards the longstanding challenge\nof program synthesis (Simon, 1963; Manna & Waldinger,\n1971), spurred by the presence of code in large datasets\n(Husain et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020) and the resulting pro-\ngramming capabilities of language models trained on these\ndatasets (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021). Popular language\nmodeling objectives like masked language modeling (Devlin\net al., 2018) and span prediction (Raffel et al., 2020) have\nalso been adapted to train their programming counterparts\nCodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) and PyMT5 (Clement et al.,\n2020).\nSimilarly, our early investigation of GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\n2020) revealed that it could generate simple programs from\nPython docstrings. While rudimentary, this capability was\nexciting because GPT-3 was not explicitly trained for code\ngeneration. Given the considerable success of large lan-\nguage models in other modalities and the abundance of\npublicly available code, we hypothesized that a specialized\nGPT model, called Codex, could excel at a variety of coding\ntasks.

When a single sample is generated for each\nproblem, GPT-12B solves no problems, but Codex (\ufb01ne-tuned\non code) solves 28.8% of the problems, and Codex-S (further\n\ufb01ne-tuned on correctly implemented standalone functions) solves\n37.7% of the problems. From here, further gains can be realized by\ngenerating 100 samples per problem and selecting the sample with\nthe highest mean log-probability (44.5% solved) or by selecting\nthe sample that passes the unit tests (77.5% solved). All samples\nare generated with temperature 0.8.\nIn this work, we focus on the task of generating stan-\ndalone Python functions from docstrings, and evaluate the\ncorrectness of code samples automatically through unit\ntests. This is in contrast to natural language generation,\nwhere samples are typically evaluated by heuristics or by\nhuman evaluators. To accurately benchmark our model,\nwe create a dataset of 164 original programming problems\nwith unit tests. These problems assess language compre-\nhension, algorithms, and simple mathematics, with some\ncomparable to simple software interview questions. We\nrelease this data along with an evaluation framework at\nhttps://www.github.com/openai/human-eval.\nTo solve a problem in our test set, we generate multiple\nsamples from the models, and check if any of them pass the\nunit tests.

In\nvision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or\nused to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their\noverall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary\nand a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform\nvery well on image classi\ufb01cation tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of\ndata and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks\n(ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellentresults from this ablation study on a ViT-B/16 model. As we can see, while\nthere is a large gap between the performances of the model with no positional embedding and mod-\nels with positional embedding, there is little to no difference between different ways of encoding\npositional information. We speculate that since our Transformer encoder operates on patch-level\ninputs, as opposed to pixel-level, the differences in how to encode spatial information is less impor-\ntant. More precisely, in patch-level inputs, the spatial dimensions are much smaller than the original\npixel-level inputs, e.g., 14\u000214as opposed to 224\u0002224, and learning to represent the spatial re-\nlations in this resolution is equally easy for these different positional encoding strategies. Even so,\nthe speci\ufb01c pattern of position embedding similarity learned by the network depends on the training\nhyperparameters (Figure 10).\n0 5 10 15 20\nNetwork depth (layer)020406080100120Mean attention distance (pixels)\nViT-L/16\nHead 1\nHead 2\nHead 3\n...\n0 5 10 15 20\nNetwork depth (layer)020406080100120\nR50x1 + ViT-L/16\nHead 1\nHead 2\nHead 3\n...\nFigure 11: Size of attended area by head and network depth.

As\ncan be seen, the theoretical bi-quadratic scaling of ViT with image size only barely starts happening\nfor the largest models at the largest resolutions.\nAnother quantity of interest is the largest batch-size each model can \ufb01t onto a core, larger being\nbetter for scaling to large datasets.

Architecture topology and architecture size have been regarded as two of the most\nimportant aspects for the performance of deep learning models and the community has spawned lots of searching algorithms for both\nof those aspects of the neural architectures. However, the performance gain from these searching algorithms is achieved under\ndifferent search spaces and training setups. This makes the overall performance of the algorithms incomparable and the improvement\nfrom a sub-module of the searching model unclear. In this paper, we propose NATS-Bench, a uni\ufb01ed benchmark on searching for both\ntopology and size, for (almost) any up-to-date NAS algorithm. NATS-Bench includes the search space of 15,625 neural cell candidates\nfor architecture topology and 32,768 for architecture size on three datasets. We analyze the validity of our benchmark in terms of\nvarious criteria and performance comparison of all candidates in the search space. We also show the versatility of NATS-Bench by\nbenchmarking 13 recent state-of-the-art NAS algorithms on it. All logs and diagnostic information trained using the same setup for\neach candidate are provided. This facilitates a much larger community of researchers to focus on developing better NAS algorithms in\na more comparable and computationally effective environment.

A controller network generates an\narchitecture proposal, which is then trained to provide a\nsignal to the controller through REINFORCE (Williams,\n1992), which then produces a new proposal, and so on.\nTraining a network for every controller update is extremely\nexpensive; utilising 800 GPUs for 28 days in Zoph & Le\n(2017). Subsequent work has sought to ameliorate this by\n(i) learning stackable cells instead of whole networks (Zoph\net al., 2018) and (ii) incorporating weight sharing ; allow-\ning candidate networks to share weights to allow for joint\ntraining (Pham et al., 2018). These contributions have ac-\ncelerated the speed of NAS algorithms e.g. to half a day on\na single GPU in Pham et al. (2018).\nFor some practitioners, NAS is still too slow; being able to\nperform NAS quickly (i.e. in seconds) would be immensely\nuseful in the hardware-aware setting where a separate search\nis typically required for each device and task (Wu et al.,\n2019; Tan et al., 2019).

This problem can e\ufb03ciently be\napproximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation\nto the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.\nThe theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,\nsolving the unconstrained optimization problem\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]/bracketrightbigg\n(5)\nfor some coe\ufb03cient \u03b2. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes\nthe max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the\nperformance of the policy \u03c0. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard\nto choose a single value of \u03b2that performs well across di\ufb00erent problems\u2014or even within a single\nproblem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal\nof a \ufb01rst-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Experiments\n6.1 Comparison of Surrogate Objectives\nFirst, we compare several di\ufb00erent surrogate objectives under di\ufb00erent hyperparameters. Here, we\ncompare the surrogate objective LCLIPto several natural variations and ablated versions.\nNo clipping or penalty: Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\nClipping: Lt(\u03b8) = min(rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At,clip(rt(\u03b8)),1\u2212/epsilon1,1 +/epsilon1)\u02c6At\nKL penalty (\ufb01xed or adaptive) Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old,\u03c0\u03b8]\n5For the KL penalty, one can either use a \ufb01xed penalty coe\ufb03cient \u03b2or an adaptive coe\ufb03cient as\ndescribed in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2\nimplemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do\none million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping ( /epsilon1)\nand the KL penalty ( \u03b2,dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in\nTable 3.\nTo represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,\nand tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard\ndeviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don\u2019t share parameters between the policy and value\nfunction (so coe\ufb03cient c1is irrelevant), and we don\u2019t use an entropy bonus.\nEach algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each\nrun of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted\nand scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best\nresult was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.\nThe Results from continuous control benchmark.

We term\nour approach Federated Learning , since the learning task is\nsolved by a loose federation of participating devices (which\nwe refer to as clients ) which are coordinated by a central\nserver . Each client has a local training dataset which is\nnever uploaded to the server. Instead, each client computes\nan update to the current global model maintained by the\nserver, and only this update is communicated. This is a\ndirect application of the principle of focused collection or\ndata minimization proposed by the 2012 White House report\non privacy of consumer data [ 39]. Since these updates are\nspeci\ufb01c to improving the current model, there is no reason\nto store them once they have been applied.\nA principal advantage of this approach is the decoupling of\nmodel training from the need for direct access to the raw\ntraining data. Clearly, some trust of the server coordinat-\ning the training is still required. However, for applications\nwhere the training objective can be speci\ufb01ed on the basis\nof data available on each client, federated learning can sig-\nni\ufb01cantly reduce privacy and security risks by limiting the\nattack surface to only the device, rather than the device and\nthe cloud.\nOur primary contributions are 1) the identi\ufb01cation of the\nproblem of training on decentralized data from mobile de-\nvices as an important research direction; 2) the selection of\na straightforward and practical algorithm that can be applied\nto this setting; and 3) an extensive empirical evaluation of\nthe proposed approach. More concretely, we introduce the\nFederatedAveraging algorithm, which combines lo-\ncal stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on each client with\na server that performs model averaging. We perform ex-\ntensive results on a variety of model architectures: a multi-layer\nperceptron, two different convolutional NNs, a two-layer\ncharacter LSTM, and a large-scale word-level LSTM.\nWhile federated learning offers many practical privacy ben-\ne\ufb01ts, providing stronger guarantees via differential pri-\nvacy [ 14,13,1], secure multi-party computation [ 18], or\ntheir combination is an interesting direction for future work.\nNote that both classes of techniques apply most naturally to\nsynchronous algorithms like FedAvg .8\n8Subsequent to this work, Bonawitz et al.

Textural properties have an important\nrole in object descriptions, particularly for those objects that\nare best quali\ufb01ed by a pattern, such as a shirt or the wing of\nbird or a butter\ufb02y as illustrated in Fig. 1. Nevertheless, so\nfar the attributes of textures have been investigated only tan-\ngentially. In this paper we address the question of whether\nthere exists a \u201cuniversal\u201d set of attributes that can describe a\nwide range of texture patterns, whether these can be reliably\nestimated from images, and for what tasks they are useful.\nThe study of perceptual attributes of textures has a\nlong history starting from pre-attentive aspects and group-\ning [16], to coarse high-level attributes [1, 2, 33], to some\nrecent work aimed at discovering such attributes by au-\ntomatically mining descriptions of images from the Inter-\nnet [3, 12]. However, the texture attributes investigated so\nfar are rather few or too generic for a detailed description\nmost \u201creal world\u201d patterns. Our work is motivated by the\none of Bhusan et al.

By advancing autonomous defense mechanisms, this research could lead to significant improvements in response times and operational efficiency, ultimately reducing the risk of prolonged undetected intrusions. The findings could pave the way for future research in applying reinforcement learning to various cybersecurity challenges, enhancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in real-world scenarios.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of accurately modeling the dynamic and adversarial nature of network environments, as well as the need for the agent to generalize its learning across different types of attacks. Naive approaches may fail due to overfitting to specific adversarial strategies, which limits the agent's ability to adapt to new threats. Additionally, the technical obstacles of creating a hierarchical architecture that effectively coordinates multiple specialized sub-agents present significant difficulties in ensuring robust performance against diverse adversaries.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has often focused on single-agent approaches that lack the generalization capabilities required for effective network defense. Limitations in existing solutions include insufficient exploration of hierarchical architectures and the failure to adequately address the complexities of multi-agent interactions in adversarial settings. Barriers such as the lack of high-fidelity simulation environments and the need for extensive training data have also hindered progress. Our approach differs by introducing a hierarchical reinforcement learning agent that combines specialized sub-agents, allowing for a more adaptable and robust defense mechanism against various adversarial strategies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hierarchical reinforcement learning agent that utilizes a controller agent to select and coordinate sub-agents trained against specific adversarial strategies. We will employ the CybORG environment to simulate realistic network scenarios, using metrics such as the agent's success rate in defending against attacks and its ability to generalize across different adversaries. The expected outcomes include demonstrating superior performance of our hierarchical agent compared to traditional single-agent defenses, showcasing its capability to adapt to various attack strategies, and providing publicly available models and training setups", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can we develop a privacy-preserving multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that utilizes adversarial contextual bandits within the CybORG environment to enhance decentralized decision-making in network security against dynamic cyber threats?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nThe implications of solving this problem are significant for the research community and practical applications in cybersecurity. As cyber threats evolve rapidly, traditional defense mechanisms often struggle to keep pace. A privacy-preserving multi-agent framework will not only improve the resilience of network security but also ensure that sensitive data is protected during agent interactions, addressing growing concerns around data privacy. This research could lay the groundwork for future investigations into autonomous cyber operations, enabling the design of more effective and ethical defense mechanisms that adapt in real-time to emerging threats, thus promoting transparency and fairness in automated decision-making processes.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges in developing this framework are multifaceted. First, the complexity of the cyber environment necessitates a sophisticated simulation that accurately represents real-world scenarios, making it difficult to create a high-fidelity training environment. Additionally, naive approaches may fail due to the dynamic nature of cyber threats, where static models cannot adequately respond to evolving attack vectors. Technical obstacles include ensuring the privacy of sensitive information shared among agents while maintaining effective communication and collaboration. The theoretical challenge lies in integrating adversarial contextual bandits into multi-agent reinforcement learning, which requires advanced algorithms capable of balancing exploration and exploitation in a decentralized manner.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on single-agent or centralized approaches to cyber defense, often neglecting the need for privacy in multi-agent systems. Existing solutions have limitations in their adaptability to network variations and fail to address ethical concerns regarding user data protection. The lack of comprehensive frameworks that incorporate privacy-preserving mechanisms alongside decentralized decision-making has been a significant barrier. My approach differs by integrating adversarial contextual bandits into a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, allowing for real-time adaptability and privacy preservation, thus filling the existing gaps in the literature and improving upon prior work.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves developing a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework within the CybORG environment, leveraging adversarial contextual bandits to facilitate decentralized decision-making. The agents will be trained using a dataset that simulates various cyber attack scenarios, focusing on metrics such as detection rate, response time, and privacy preservation effectiveness. I expect the outcomes to demonstrate enhanced collaboration among agents in mitigating cyber threats while maintaining user data confidentiality, resulting in a more robust and ethical approach to network security.

To support the application of machine\nlearning algorithms to solve this problem, and to\nencourage researchers in this \ufb01eld to attend to prob-\nlems in the ACO setting, we introduce CybORG, a\nwork-in-progress gym for ACO research. CybORG\nfeatures a simulation and emulation environment\nwith a common interface to facilitate the rapid\ntraining of autonomous agents that can then be\ntested on real-world systems. Initial testing demon-\nstrates the feasibility of this approach.\n1Background\nAutonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) is concerned with\nthe defence of computer systems and networks through au-\ntonomous decision-making and action. It is particularly\nneeded where deploying security experts to cover every net-\nwork and location is becoming increasingly untenable, and\nwhere systems cannot be reliably accessed by human defend-\ners, either due to unreliable communication channels or ad-\nversary action.\nThe ACO domain is challenging to develop arti\ufb01cial intelli-\ngence (AI) approaches for as it combines hard problems from\nother domains of AI research. Like game AI, it is adversar-\nial: the effectiveness of a defensive cyber agent is determined\nby its ability to respond to an adversary. Like autonomous\nrobotics, ACO is affected by the \u2018reality gap\u2019 [Ibarz et al. ,\n2021 ], as simulations of an environment willabstract away\ninformation that could be critical to an agent\u2019s effectiveness.\nA further issue for the ACO domain is that the environment\nand action set change as cyber security research progresses,\nwhich is far more rapidly than either of the domains discussed\nabove.\nThe requirement to handle the varying actions of an adver-\nsary, in a complex environment, precludes the use of static\ndata sets to learn ACO behaviour. A tool for learning in ad-\nversarial environments is an AI Gym. AI Gyms such as the\none developed by OpenAI implement reinforcement learning(RL) through direct interaction with a simulation of the prob-\nlem. A path to addressing the \u2018reality gap\u2019, used in [Tanet\nal., 2016 ], is to combine learning on simulations with testing\nin a real environment. In this case, the bulk of learning is\nconducted on simulated systems. Successful agents are trans-\nferred to the real system to \ufb01rstly validate their effectiveness,\nand secondly to re\ufb01ne the simulation.\nWe believe that AI Gyms, that can be validated and re-\n\ufb01ned throughexperiments, the requirements of ACO motivate an in-\ntegrated design comprising emulation and simulation modes\nto support large scale RL across diverse scenarios.\nWe have made progress towards implementing this design,\nwith the ability to spawn and play games either in simula-\ntion mode or emulation mode with cloud infrastructure. In\nCybORG, we can now train an RL agent in simulation then\ntest its effectiveness in emulation.

Games have\nserved as stepping stones along this path for decades, from Backgammon (1992) to Chess (1997) to\nAtari (2013)[1\u20133]. In 2016, AlphaGo defeated the world champion at Go using deep reinforcement\nlearning and Monte Carlo tree search[4]. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) models have\ntackled tasks as varied as robotic manipulation[5], text summarization [6], and video games such as\nStarcraft[7] and Minecraft[8].\nRelative to previous AI milestones like Chess or Go, complex video games start to capture the\ncomplexity and continuous nature of the real world. Dota 2 is a multiplayer real-time strategy game\nproduced by Valve Corporation in 2013, which averaged between 500,000 and 1,000,000 concurrent\nplayers between 2013 and 2019. The game is actively played by full time professionals; the prize\npool for the 2019 international championship exceeded $35 million (the largest of any esports game\nin the world)[9, 10]. The game presents challenges for reinforcement learning due to long time\nhorizons, partial observability, and high dimensionality of observation and action spaces.

We\nbuilt a distributed training system to do this which we used to train a Dota 2-playing agent called\nOpenAI Five. In April 2019, OpenAI Five defeated the Dota 2 world champions (Team OG1), the\n\ufb01rst time an AI system has beaten an esport world champion2. We also opened OpenAI Five to\nthe Dota 2 community for competitive play; OpenAI Five won 99.4% of over 7000 games.\nOne challenge we faced in training was that the environment and code continually changed as\nour project progressed. In order to train without restarting from the beginning after each change,\nwe developed a collection of tools to resume training with minimal loss in performance which we\ncallsurgery. Over the 10-month training process, we performed approximately one surgery per\ntwo weeks. These tools allowed us to make frequent improvements to our strongest agent within a\nshorter time than the typical practice of training from scratch would allow. As AI systems tackle\nlarger and harder problems, further investigation of settings with ever-changing environments and\niterative development will be critical.\nIn section 2, we describe Dota 2 in more detail along with the challenges it presents. In section 3\nwe discuss the technical components of the training system, leaving most of the details to appendices\ncited therein.

The leading contenders are deep Q-learning [Mni+15],\n\u201cvanilla\u201d policy gradient Background: Policy Optimization\n2.1 Policy Gradient Methods\nIn TRPO [Sch+15b], an objective function (the \u201csurrogate\u201d objective) is maximized subject to a\nconstraint on the size of the policy update. Speci\ufb01cally,\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At/bracketrightbigg\n(3)\nsubject to \u02c6Et[KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]]\u2264\u03b4. (4)\nHere,\u03b8oldis the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can e\ufb03ciently be\napproximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation\nto the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.\nThe theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,\nsolving the unconstrained optimization problem\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]/bracketrightbigg\n(5)\nfor some coe\ufb03cient \u03b2. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes\nthe max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the\nperformance of the policy \u03c0. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard\nto choose a single value of \u03b2that performs well across di\ufb00erent problems\u2014or even within a single\nproblem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal\nof a \ufb01rst-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Experiments\n6.1 Comparison of Surrogate Objectives\nFirst, we compare several di\ufb00erent surrogate objectives under di\ufb00erent hyperparameters. Here, we\ncompare the surrogate objective LCLIPto several natural variations and ablated versions.\nNo clipping or penalty: Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\nClipping: Lt(\u03b8) = min(rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At,clip(rt(\u03b8)),1\u2212/epsilon1,1 +/epsilon1)\u02c6At\nKL penalty (\ufb01xed or adaptive) Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old,\u03c0\u03b8]\n5For the KL penalty, one can either use a \ufb01xed penalty coe\ufb03cient \u03b2or an adaptive coe\ufb03cient as\ndescribed in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2\nimplemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do\none million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping ( /epsilon1)\nand the KL penalty ( \u03b2,dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in\nTable 3.\nTo represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,\nand tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard\ndeviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don\u2019t share parameters between the policy and value\nfunction (so coe\ufb03cient c1is irrelevant), and we don\u2019t use an entropy bonus.\nEach algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each\nrun of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted\nand scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best\nresult was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.\nThe Results from continuous control benchmark. Average normalized scores (over 21 runs of the\nalgorithm, on 7 environments) for each algorithm / hyperparameter setting . \u03b2was initialized at 1.\n6.2 Comparison to Other Algorithms in the", " Introduction\nReinforcement learning algorithms aim at learning policies\nfor achieving target tasks by maximizing rewards provided\nby the environment. In some scenarios, these rewards are\nsupplied to the agent continuously, e.g. the running score\nin an Atari game (Mnih et al., 2015), or the distance be-\ntween a robot arm and an object in a reaching task (Lilli-\ncrap et al., 2016).

This is a problem as the agent receives\nreinforcement for updating its policy only if it succeeds in\nreaching a pre-speci\ufb01ed goal state. Hoping to stumble into\na goal state by chance (i.e. random exploration) is likely to\nbe futile for all but the simplest of environments.\nAs human agents, we are accustomed to operating with re-\nwards that are so sparse that we only experience them once\nor twice in a lifetime, if at all. To a three-year-old enjoy-\ning a sunny Sunday afternoon on a playground, most trap-\npings of modern life \u2013 college, good job, a house, a family \u2013\nare so far into the future, they provide no useful reinforce-\nment signal. Yet, the three-year-old has no trouble enter-\ntaining herself in that playground using what psychologists\ncall intrinsic motivation (Ryan, 2000) or curiosity (Silvia,\n2012). Motivation/curiosity have been used to explain the\nneed to explore the environment and discover novel states.\nThe French word \ufb02\u02c6aneur perfectly captures the notion of a\ncuriosity-driven observer, the \u201cdeliberately aimless pedes-\ntrian, unencumbered by any obligation or sense of urgency\u201d\n(Cornelia Otis Skinner). More generally, curiosity is a way\nof learning new skills which might come handy for pursu-\ning rewards in the future.\nSimilarly, in reinforcement learning, intrinsic motiva-\ntion/rewards become critical whenever extrinsic rewards\nare sparse. Most formulations of intrinsic reward can be\ngrouped into two broad classes: 1) encourage the agent\nto explore \u201cnovel\u201d states (Bellemare et al., 2016; LopesarXiv:1705.05363v1  [cs.LG]  15 May 2017Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction\net al., 2012; Poupart et al., 2006) or, 2) encourage the agent\nto perform actions that reduce the error/uncertainty in the\nagent\u2019s ability to predict the consequence of its own ac-\ntions (i.e. its knowledge about the environment) (Houthooft\net al., 2016; Mohamed & Rezende, 2015; Schmidhuber,\n1991; 2010; Singh et al., 2005; Stadie et al., 2015).\nMeasuring \u201cnovelty\u201d requires a statistical model of the dis-\ntribution of the environmental states, whereas measuring\nprediction error/uncertainty requires building a model of\nenvironmental dynamics that predicts the next state ( st+1)\ngiven the current state ( st) and the action ( at) executed\nat timet. Both these models are hard to build in high-\ndimensional continuous state spaces such as images.

By improving sim-to-real transfer, we can enable more effective training of robots in simulated environments, leading to practical applications in various industries such as search and rescue, exploration, and assistive technologies. This research could also inspire future studies on self-cognition in robots and the integration of visual perception, ultimately contributing to the development of more autonomous and intelligent robotic systems.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in this area stem from the complexities of real-world dynamics, which are often unpredictable and influenced by numerous factors such as terrain variability and robot design. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate interactions between the robot and its environment, leading to suboptimal performance. Technical obstacles include the need for robust algorithms that can generalize across different terrains and the theoretical understanding of how to effectively model these interactions. Additionally, practical issues such as the limitations of current simulation environments and the need for extensive data collection further complicate the problem.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on either simulation or real-world performance in isolation, leading to a gap in understanding how to effectively bridge the two. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive models that account for the diverse factors affecting locomotion in real environments. Barriers such as insufficient theoretical frameworks and the absence of effective training methodologies have hindered progress. Our approach differs by employing a multi-head decoder to disentangle environmental characteristics and robot parameters, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the sim-to-real transfer process.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves a sampling-based policy decomposition that utilizes trajectories from various policy checkpoints to ensure stability during training. We will employ a multi-head decoder architecture to separately extract terrain distributions and robot proprioceptive parameters, using a dataset of simulated environments. The performance will be evaluated using metrics that assess locomotion policy capacity and adaptability in real-world scenarios. We expect our results to demonstrate enhanced locomotion capabilities and improved lifelong policy adaptation, ultimately leading to more effective sim-to-real transfer in legged robots.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question we aim to address is: How can a hybrid multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, which leverages contextual interaction data from speaker diarization systems, enhance decision-making processes in dynamic auditory environments?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem holds significant implications for both the research community and practical applications in speaker diarization systems. By advancing the capabilities of MARL in the context of speaker diarization, we can significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of systems used in complex auditory environments, such as multi-speaker scenarios and overlapping speech. This research could pave the way for future studies to explore cooperative learning among agents, leading to innovations in real-time speech recognition, teleconferencing, and various human-computer interaction applications. Furthermore, addressing this question may lead to the development of more adaptive systems that learn from their environments, thereby enhancing user experiences and operational efficiencies in industries reliant on accurate voice recognition technologies.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges involved in solving this problem are multifaceted. First, the dynamic nature of auditory environments, characterized by varying speaker identities and overlapping speech, complicates the ability of agents to accurately segment and recognize speakers in real-time. Naive approaches that rely solely on isolated learning may fail to capture the cooperative dynamics essential for accurate speaker diarization. Moreover, the integration of lifelong learning principles presents technical obstacles, such as the need for structured knowledge retention mechanisms to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The theoretical complexities of designing an effective reward structure for agent interactions, as well as ensuring efficient peer-to-peer communication, further complicate the development of a robust MARL framework.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has made strides in speaker diarization and reinforcement learning; however, gaps remain in effectively combining these domains. Existing approaches often focus on either supervised or isolated reinforcement learning, neglecting the potential benefits of cooperative learning among agents in dynamic environments. Barriers such as limited datasets, inadequate modeling of contextual interactions, and the absence of lifelong learning mechanisms have hindered progress. Our approach differs by integrating these elements into a cohesive framework, allowing agents to share experiences and adapt collectively in real-time, thereby addressing previous limitations.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid MARL framework where multiple agents collaborate in a peer-to-peer network to enhance speaker diarization performance. We will utilize contextual interaction data collected from real-time speaker diarization systems to inform agent decision-making processes. The agents will be trained using a combination of reinforcement learning techniques, emphasizing lifelong learning principles to ensure continuous improvement and knowledge retention. We will evaluate our approach using metrics such as segmentation accuracy, speaker identification rates, and adaptability in varying auditory contexts, employing datasets that simulate multi-speaker environments. The expected outcomes include improved robustness and accuracy in speaker diarization, with potential applications extending to teleconferencing, virtual assistants, and any context requiring effective speech recognition in complex auditory scenarios.", "referenced_intros": [" INTRODUCTION\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and\nthe development of User Generated Content (UGC) [ 78] in recent years.

Similarly, in the policy\nevaluation stage, we parameterize the Q-function by a linear\ncombination of the enlarged skill sets [\u03d5\u25e6, \u03d5],Q(s, a;w) =\nw\u22a4\n1\u03d5\u25e6(s, a) +w\u22a4\n2\u03d5(s, a). We can minimize the TD error,\nmin\nw1,w2E(s,a,r,s\u2032)\u223cB,a\u2032\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|s\u2032)[(r+\u03b3Q(s\u2032, a\u2032)\n\u2212w\u22a4\n1\u03d5\u25e6(s, a)\u2212w\u22a4\n2\u03d5(s, a))2]\n(13)\nThen we can optimize the policy similar to (3) with the new\nlinear parameterization of Q-function.\nPolicy Synthesis. When initializing the real-world stage, we\ninitialize the policy by simulator policy \u03c0\u25e6and weights w1\nby the simulator learned weights w\u03c0\u25e6so that we do not need\nto learn the Q-function from scratch. The skill discovery\nand policy synthesis are conducted simultaneously, and the\nalgorithm is listed in Algorithm 2. To avoid the instability\ncaused by changing from the simulator to the real world, we\npenalize the KL-divergence between the simulator policy\nand the updated policy to (3) when solving the real-world\npolicy improvement,\nmax\n\u03c0Es\u223cB,a\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|s)[Q(s, a)]\u2212\u03c4\u03c0\u00afDKL(\u03c0\u2225\u03c0\u25e6) (14)\nwhere \u00afDKL(\u03c0\u2225\u03c0\u25e6) =Es[DKL(\u03c0(\u00b7 |s)\u2225\u03c0\u25e6(\u00b7 |s))],\u03c4\u03c0is a\nhyperparameter penalizing policy update.\nPractical Implementations. In practical implementations,\nwe add several modifications to the soft actor-critic (SAC) [2]\nalgorithm. First, we change the Q-function parameterization\nto the linear representation w\u22a4\n1\u03d5\u25e6(s, a) +w\u22a4\n2\u03d5(s, a). The\nrepresentations \u03d5, \u00b5, \u03d5\u25e6, \u00b5\u25e6are all parameterized by fully-\nconnected neural networks. Second, we use a special pa-\nrameterization called differentiable Mellinger controllers to\nparameterize the mean of stochastic actor. The differentiable\nMellinger controllers are inspired by the commonly used\nMellinger controller", " Introduction\nFollowing the impressive recent success of reinforcement learning (RL) [ 30,40,31,3] in various\napplications, a plethora of research has been done in improving the learning efficiency of RL\nalgorithms. One important avenue of the extension is the Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL),\nin which an agent aims to continuously learn and improve its decision-making policy over sequentially\narriving tasks without forgetting previously learned tasks. The motivation for such extension is clear\nsince it is not practical to either re-train an agent to learn multiple tasks seen so far or train a dedicated\nagent for each task whenever a new task to learn arrives. The need for CRL is particularly pressing\nwhen the sequentially arriving tasks to learn are similar to each other as in robot action learning [ 18].\nIn general, one of the main challenges of continual learning (CL) is to effectively transfer the learned\nknowledge to a new task ( i.e., improve plasticity) while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously\nlearned knowledge ( i.e., improve stability). So far, most of the CRL methods, the details are described as follows:\n\u2022 EWC, P&C: The regularization coefficient was set to 1000\n\u2022BC: The regularization coefficient was set to 1, and the expert buffer size |Mk|was set to\n10kfor task k.\n\u2022R&D: The regularization coefficient was set to 1, and the expert buffer size |Mk|was set to\n10kfor task k.

This improvement allows AI to learn new tasks more\neffectively without detrimental effects from previous experiences, leading to more robust applications.\nIndustries reliant on AI for automation and optimization can benefit from increased efficiency and\ncost savings, as AI systems reduce downtime and the need for retraining. Additionally, advancements\nin robotics (e.g., healthcare robots, autonomous vehicles, and industrial robots) can lead to safer and\nmore reliable robots, enhancing their integration into everyday and high-stakes environments.\nA.9 Limitations\nThough, in our work, we only consider the effect of the negative transfer, considering the positive\ntransfer is also important point in CRL. Our method, R&D, can effectively resolve the negative\ntransfer, but does not have the ability on the positive transfer by utilizing the useful information on\nthe previous tasks. Furthermore, our results\nThe hyperparameters for SAC and PPO are described in", " Introduction\nA useful agent is one that can accomplish many objectives\nin a domain. Household robots are more beneficial the more\nchores they can complete; self-driving cars the more places\nthey can reach. Building upon this premise, we draw inspira-\ntion from the recent success of unsupervised learning in lan-\nguage (Brown et al., 2020) and vision (Kirillov et al., 2023),\nwhich has shown that a single generalist model trained on\nInternet-scale data can immediately solve a wide array of\ntasks without further training or fine-tuning. Motivated by\nthese successes, we study an analogous way to train a gen-\neralist agent from unlabeled offline data such that it can im-\nmediately solve new user-specified tasks in a without train-\ning. This has been referred to as the zero-shot reinforcement\nlearning (RL) problem (Touati et al., 2022). From this data,\nthe hard challenge is how to discover, without labels, a task\nrepresentation that is robust to downstream objectives \u2013 inessence, bypassing the need for a human to specify well-\nshaped reward functions before training.\nIn this work, we aim to provide a simple, scalable approach\nto the zero-shot RL problem. Our key insight is to directly\nlearn a latent representation that can represent any arbitrary\nreward functions based on their samples of state-reward\npairs. We refer to this idea as Functional Reward Encod-\ning(FRE ). This is in contrast to previous works in zero-\nshot RL or multi-task RL that employ domain-specific task\nrepresentations (Barreto et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a) or\nhighly restrictive linear reward structures (Borsa et al., 2018;\nTouati & Ollivier, 2021; Touati et al., 2022). By directly\nencoding reward functions into a latent space, we can pre-\ntrain a multi-task agent with a host of unsupervised reward\nfunctions of arbitrary diversity, and quickly identify the rep-\nresentations corresponding to new test tasks given a small\nnumber of reward-annotated samples.\nTraining an FRE requries utilizing a prior distribution over\nreward functions. When no information about downstream\ntasks is available, we must define a prior that broadly spans\npossible objectives in a domain-agnostic manner. In our ex-\nperiments, we show that a mixture of random unsupervised\nreward functions , such as goal-reaching and random MLP re-\nwards, are a reasonable choice for the reward prior. We opti-\nmize an FRE-conditioned policy towards all rewards within\nthis space. In this way, approximate solutions to many down-\nstream tasks have already been learned , and the zero-shot\nRL problem reduces to simply locating the FRE encoding\nfor the task, which the learned encoder accomplishes.\nThus, our framework presents a simple yet scalable method\nfor training zero-shot RL agents in an unsupervised manner,\nas shown in Figure 1. The main idea is to (1) train an FRE\nnetwork over random unsupervised reward functions, then\n(2) optimize a generalist FRE-conditioned policy towards\nmaximizing said rewards, after which (3) novel tasks can\nbe solved by simply encoding samples of their reward func-\ntions, such that the FRE agent can immediately act without\nfurther training.\n1arXiv:2402.17135v1  [cs.LG]  27 Feb 2024Figure 1. FRE discovers latent representations over random un-\nsupervised reward functions. At evaluation, user-given down-\nstream objectives can be encoded into the latent space to en-\nable zero-shot policy execution. FRE utilizes simple building\nblocks and is a data-scalable way to learn general capabilities from\nunlabeled offline trajectory data.\nWe verify the efficacy of our method through experiments\nconfirming the effectiveness of FRE as", " Introduction to Riemannian manifolds .

For example, offline RL (Fu-\njimoto, Meger, and Precup 2019; Kumar et al. 2020; Fu-\njimoto and Gu 2021; Kostrikov, Nair, and Levine 2022),\nwhich optimizes the policies with a pre-collected and static\n*Zongzhang Zhang is the corresponding author.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

In OMRL, we are pro-\nvided with datasets collected in various tasks which share\nsome similarity in the underlying structures in dynamics or\nreward mechanisms, and aim to optimize the meta-policy.\nThe meta-policy is later tested in tasks drawn from the same\ntask distribution. Previous related results show GENTLE\u2019s superior perfor-\nmance in diverse environments and tasks. The ablation stud-\nies emphasize the necessity of each component of GENTLE.\nNotwithstanding the achievements, our work leaves some\naspects unaddressed.

The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and\ngeneration; it includes results of RAG\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu-\nments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\nactions based on confidence levels.\nD. Scaling laws of RAG\nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based\non RAG are still one of the focuses of current re-\nsearchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of\nthe key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for\nLLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial\nstudies like RETRO++ [44] have begun to address this, yet the\nparameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs.\nThe possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law10, where smaller\nmodels outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and\nmerits further investigation.\nE. Production-Ready RAG\nRAG\u2019s practicality and alignment with engineering require-\nments have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing re-\ntrieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowl-\nedge bases, and ensuring data security\u2014such as preventing\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prizeinadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by\nLLMs\u2014are critical engineering challenges that remain to be\naddressed [175].\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG-\nrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The\nemerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized\nproducts. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code\napproach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including\nRAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other\ntechnologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are\nalso gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field.\nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and\ncloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include\nRAG-centric services.

RAG toolkits are converging into a\nfoundational technology stack, laying the groundwork for\nadvanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated,\ncomprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring\nfurther innovation and development.\nF . Multi-modal RAG\nRAG has transcended its initial text-based question-\nanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\nImage .

However, RL in the real world is complicated\nby constraints on efficiency, safety, and overall training stability,\nwhich limits its practical applicability. We present APRL, a\npolicy regularization framework that modulates the robot\u2019s\nexploration over the course of training, striking a balance\nbetween flexible improvement potential and focused, efficient\nexploration. APRL enables a quadrupedal robot to efficiently\nlearn to walk entirely in the real world within minutes and\ncontinue to improve with more training where prior work\nsaturates in performance. We demonstrate that continued\ntraining with APRLresults show that APRL is\nsignificantly better equipped than na \u00a8\u0131ve RL to continually\nimprove as it collects more data, as opposed to quickly\nreaching but plateauing with limited capabilities.\nTransferring to different scenarios. We find that APRL not\nonly successfully enables a quadrupedal robot trained only\nin the real world to walk amid a variety of conditions, but\nalso to keep improving as it continues to be deployed. Quan-\ntitatively, the policy learned with APRL even without fine-\ntuning is significantly better on average at walking than the\nRestricted policy in terms of average velocity (see Figure 7)\nand at completing a given path faster and with fewer falls (see\nFigure 8). The exception is when we freeze a joint, in which\ncase the Restricted policy generalizes much better during\nzero-shot evaluation. In this case, we find that with continued\ntraining, APRL can quickly learn to overcome this gap. In\nFigure 5, we show a qualitative comparison of policies where\nthe path can be visualized with a static camera. We encourage\nthe reader to view the qualitative differences in policies for\neach scenario on our project website.\nVI. S IMULATED ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we analyze APRL using a simulated\nversion of the task described in Section III. Although simu-\nlation does not model many of the real-world complexities\nthat we aim to address, we use it to perform controlledexperiments for comparison purposes and insight. We design\nour simulatedmethods can\ncause the networks to lose plasticity, the ability to continue\nlearning with more data, and propose periodic resets of the\nagent to mitigate this effect. Resetting specifically implies\nreinitialization of network weights and optimizer states while\nmaintaining the replay buffer. We incorporate this regularizer\ninto our adaptive strategy as we will describe next.\nIV. E FFICIENT LEARNING OF LEGGED LOCOMOTION\nWITH ADAPTIVE POLICY REGULARIZATION\nWe present our system for efficiently learning and fine-\ntuning quadrupedal locomotion in real-world scenarios using\nAdaptive Policy ReguLarization (APRL). Our framework,\nshown in Figure 2, involves dynamically modulating policy\nregularization over the course of training to provide the\npolicy with adequate room to explore and improve, but not\nso unbridled as to lead to inefficient\u2014and often violent\u2014\ntraining. To do so, we introduce \u2018soft\u2019 constraints on the\nactions (defined in (b)) that are adjusted based on how\n\u2018familiar\u2019 the robot is in its current situation (described in\n(c)). We also incorporate resets to improve plasticity, i.e., the\nability to keep learning from new data. In the remainder of\nthis section, we describe the principle underlying our choice\nof regularization. We then detail how we adapt the constraints\nbased on the robot\u2019s learning progress and finally how we\nimplement them in practice. Algorithm 1 summarizes the\ntraining procedure in pseudocode.\na) An efficiency-performance trade-off: Prior work has\nshown that explicit action limits have an enormous effect on\nlearning", " INTRODUCTION\nAnimals have evolved a spectrum of locomotion gaits to\nmaximize their robustness and efficiency at different terrains\nand speeds [1], [2]. Reproducing such natural gait transitions\nhas been a challenging topic in the legged robotic community\ndue to the complexity of multi-legged systems. To produce\nstable gait motions, most methods using only proprioception, in two tests of robust\nand agile locomotion:\n1)Baseline [17]: Our previous work used the teacher-\nstudent training framework and the AMP dataset of\ntrotting gait.\n2)MoB [26]: The policy was trained with more gait\nparameters, which can tune gait behaviors to aid\ngeneralization to different tasks, according to user\u2019s\ncommands.\n1The video is available in https://youtu.be/MoFm6 JVNkoThe two tests are shown in Fig. 5. The robust test is climbing\nstairs with a width of 25 cm and a height of 20 cm , while the\nagile test is sprinting over vegetation with a vcmd\nxof2.5 m/s.\nFig. 5. The robust (left) and agile (right) tests outdoors.\nWe conducted five runs for each test and computed success\nrates. A test was successful if the robot could climb over the\nstairs or sprint out of the vegetation. The result is shown\nin Table V. Since the Baseline was trained using only the\nTABLE V\nOVERALL COMPARISON WITH THREE Methods Multiple gaits Robust test ( %) Agile test ( %)\nBaseline No 40 60\nMoB Yes 0 20\nOurs Yes 100 80\nAMP dataset of trotting gait, it is unable to achieve multiple\ngaits control compared to the MoB and Ours, which were\ntrained with gait parameters and gait-dependent rewards.\nHowever, the Baseline and Ours are more robust and agile\nthan the MoB, as shown in Table V. This can be explained\nby the fact that the MoB was trained on the flat and focused\non the detailed control of gait behaviors, while the others\nwere trained over different terrains and had more flexibilityto lean adaptive behaviors. Although the MoB can tune\ngait details to aid generalization to different tasks, it can\nhardly generalize to challenging terrains by tuning only gait\nparameters. Moreover, Ours has higher success rates than\nthe Baseline when performing robust and agile locomotion.\nThis performance difference is likely due to the different\nlearning frameworks. Ours used the asymmetric actor-critic\nframework, which had smaller sim-to-real gap than the\nBaseline that used the teacher-student framework.\nV. experiments show that our robot can achieve\nmultiple gaits according to user\u2019s commands, while\nachieving robust and agile locomotion.\nII. METHOD\nA. Reinforcement Learning Problem Formulation\nSince the terrains are not fully observable without exte-\nroceptive sensors, our locomotion problem is modeled as a\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The\nenvironment is completely defined by a full state xtat time\nstept. The agent\u2019s policy performs an action at, and then the\nenvironment moves to the next state xt+1with a transition\nprobability P(xt+1|xt,at)and returns a reward rtand a\npartial observation xp\nt+1. The goal of RL is to find a policy\n\u03c0to maximize the expected discounted return over the future\ntrajectory:\nJ(\u03c0) =E\u03c0\"\u221eX\nt=0\u03b3trt#\n, (1)\nwhere \u03b3t\u2208[0,1)is a discount factor.\nRecent works have leveraged the teacher-student training\nparadigm to address the POMDP [11]\u2013[13], [17]. While\nit has been empirically shown that the student policy can\nachieve similar performance to the teacher policy, the student\ncan never outperform the teacher. Moreover, training the\nteacher and student networks sequentially requires more data,\nwhich is sample inefficient.To learn robust blind locomotion in one training phase, we\ntrain our policy using proximal policy optimization (PPO)\n[29], employing", " Introduction .

We codify these intuitions in the following definitions.\nDefinition 3.1. Anagent basis (or simply, a basis), \u039bB\u2282\u039b, is any non-empty subset of \u039b.\nNotice that an agent basis is a choice of agent set, \u039b. We explicitly call out a basis with distinct\nnotation (\u039bB) as it serves an important role in the discussion that follows. For example, we next\nintroduce learning rules as functions that switch between elements of an agent basis for each history.\nDefinition 3.2. Alearning rule over an agent basis \u039bBis a function, \ud835\udf0e:\u210b\u2192\u039bB, that selects a\nbase agent for each history.\nWe let \u03a3denote the set of all learning rules over \u039bB, and let\u03a3denote any non-empty subset of\n\u03a3. A learning rule is a mechanism for switching between the available base agents following each\nnew experience. Notice that learning rules are deterministic; while a simple extension captures the\nstochastic case, we will see by Theorem 3.1 that the above is sufficiently general in a certain sense.\nWe use\ud835\udf0e(\u210e)(\u210e)to refer to the action distribution selected by the agent \ud835\udf06=\ud835\udf0e(\u210e)at any history \u210e.\nDefinition 3.3. Let\u03a3be a set of learning rules over some basis \u039bB, and let\ud835\udc52be an environment. We\nsay that a set \u039bis\ud835\udeba-generated by\u039bBin\ud835\udc52, denoted\u039bB\u22a2\ud835\udc52\u03a3\u039b, if and only if\n\u2200\ud835\udf06\u2208\u039b\u2203\ud835\udf0e\u2208\u03a3\u2200\u210e\u2208\u00af\u210b\ud835\udf06(\u210e)=\ud835\udf0e(\u210e)(\u210e). (3.1)\nThus, any choice of \u03a3together with a basis \u039bBinduces a family of agent sets whose elements can be\nunderstood as switching between the basis according to the rules prescribed by \u03a3. We then say that\na basis generates an agent set in an environment if there exists a set of learning rules that switches\nbetween the basis elements to produce the agent set.\nDefinition 3.4. We say a basis \u039bBgenerates\u039bin\ud835\udc52, denoted\u039bB\u22a2\ud835\udc52\u039b, if and only if\n\u039bB\u22a2\ud835\udc52\u03a3\u039b. (3.2)\nIntuitively, an agent basis \u039bBgenerates another agent set \u039bjust when the agents in \u039bcan be\nunderstood as switching between the base agents. It is in this sense that we can understand agents\nas searching through a basis\u2014an agent is just a particular sequence of history-conditioned switches\nover a basis. For instance, let us return to the example of", "Abstract \u2014 Quadrupedal robots resemble the physical ability\nof legged animals to walk through unstructured terrains.\nHowever, designing a controller for quadrupedal robots poses\na signi\ufb01cant challenge due to their functional complexity\nand requires adaptation to various terrains. Recently, deep\nreinforcement learning, inspired by how legged animals learn\nto walk from their experiences, has been utilized to synthe-\nsize natural quadrupedal locomotion. However, state-of-the-artmethods, as quantitatively veri\ufb01ed by the high survival rate\nand maximum push that it can withstand. The robust perfor-\nmance was achieved through the interplay between accurate\nestimation and robust policy learning of DreamWaQ. More-\nover, the proposed AdaBoot method also increases robustness\nwithout sacri\ufb01cing the base performance.\nIn the real world, DreamWaQ\u2019s policy is robust against\nunstructured terrains. Fig. 6 shows the robot\u2019s foot re\ufb02ex\nwhen faced with foot stumbling and slipping. The robot can\nimmediately adapt its gait and stabilize its pose. Owing to\nthe robust and accurate CENet, the robot had no problem in\nits body velocity estimation and could continue its journey\nwithout any performance deterioration.\nIn Fig. 6(a), the robot exhibits different gaits for going\ndownstairs and upstairs. When going downstairs, the robot\ntends to tilt its body closer to the ground and maintain its\nfront foot far from the body, which is a key gait pattern\nfor quickly \ufb01nding a stable foothold. Meanwhile, the robot\nadapts its gait for going upstairs by signi\ufb01cantly increasing\nits footsteps. This gait is necessary so that the foot can safely\novercome the stairs and \ufb01nd a stable foothold while climbing.\nMoreover, Fig. 6(b) shows the adaptation to slipping, where\nthe robot can immediately detect irregular footholds and\nadapt its gait pattern. Subsequently, the robot tries to recover\nits normal pattern and continues to walk.\nG. Long-Distance Walk\nWe deployed the robot on two challenging outdoor courses\nto demonstrate the robustness of DreamWaQ. Course A was\nan on-campus yard consisting of many slopes and deformable\nterrains. Course B was an on-campus hill with an elevation\ngain of up to 22 m. Courses A and B have a total length of\n430 m and 465 m, respectively. The details of the courses are\nshown in Fig. 7. The robot\u2019s trajectory was measured using a\nreal-time kinematic (RTK) GPS [39] with a frequency of 10\nHz, mounted on top of the robot.

The robot\nalso encountered thick vegetation that trapped the robot\u2019s\nlegs. However, the robot successfully adapted its speed by\nincreasing joint power to overcome the trap.\nThe most challenging part of this course is walking\nthrough stairs and deformable slopes. Thanks to the robust-\nness of the policy and accurate estimation of DreamWaQ,\nthe robot could safely walk through the stairs and slopes.\nWe conducted theresults with the most\nrobust", " Introduction\nRecent works have established that quadruped locomotion controllers trained with reinforcement\nlearning in simulation can successfully be transferred to traverse challenging natural terrains [1, 2,\n6th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2022), Auckland, New Zealand.arXiv:2212.03238v1  [cs.RO]  6 Dec 20223]. Adaptation to diverse terrains is accomplished by estimating terrain properties from sensory\nobservations that are then used by the controller (i.e., online system identi\ufb01cation ). The success of\nthis paradigm relies on two assumptions: a priori modeling of environment parameters that can vary\nduring deployment and the ability to estimate these parameters from sensory observations. To bypass\nthe \ufb01rst assumption, one possibility is to widely vary a large set of environment parameters during\ntraining. However, this creates a hard learning problem due to creation of challenging or infeasible\nlocomotion scenarios. To simplify learning, typically the designer chooses a subset of parameters\nthat are randomized in a carefully restricted range. Even in this setup, additional measures such as a\nlearning curriculum and reward shaping are necessary for successful learning in simulation.\nAs a result of these practical restrictions on the expressiveness of the simulation, quite often the\nrobot encounters scenarios during deployment that were not modeled during training. For instance,\nif the robot is only presented with \ufb02at ground and terrain geometry is not varied during training,\nit may fail to traverse non-\ufb02at terrains such as stairs. In such a case, it is common to tweak the\ntraining environments or the reward functions and re-train the policy. This iterative loop of re-\ntraining and real-world testing is tedious. To make things worse, in some scenarios such iteration is\ninsuf\ufb01cient because it is not possible to accurately model or sense important environment properties.\nFor example, thick bushes are both hard to simulate due to compliance and hard to sense because\ndepth sensors do not distinguish them from walls. Thus, the robot may attempt to climb over thick\nbushes like a rock or move through them with an overly conservative gait that leaves the robot stuck.\nThe examples above illustrate that even for the most advanced sim-to-real systems, the real world\noffers new challenges. We broadly refer to scenarios that can be simulated but are not anticipated\nduring training and the situations which cannot be simulated or identi\ufb01ed from sensory observations\nasout-of-distribution cases. We present a framework for policy learning that enables improved per-\nformance in out-of-distribution scenarios under some assumptions detailed below. Our key insight\nis that given a task, there are multiple equally good solutions (i.e., under-speci\ufb01cation [4]) that have\nequivalent training performance but can generalize in different ways. For instance, the task of walk-\ning on \ufb02at ground only imposes a constraint on the velocity of robot\u2019s body, but not on how the legs\nshould move, or high should the torso be above the ground, etc. Consider two different walking\nbehaviors: crouch where the robot keeps its torso close to the ground and stomp where the torso is\nhigh and also the legs have a high foot swing. While both crouch andstomp succeed at walking on\n\ufb02at ground, their generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios is different: with crouch the robot\ncan traverse under obstacles but not stairs, whereas with stomp it can climb over curbs/stairs but not\nmove under obstacles (Figure 1).\nOut of the many", " Introduction\nOf what use is vision during locomotion? Clearly, there is a role of vision in navigation \u2013 using\nmaps or landmarks to \ufb01nd a trajectory in the 2D plane to a distant goal while avoiding obstacles. But\ngiven a local direction in which to move, it turns out that both humans [ 1] and robots [ 2,3] can do\nremarkably well at blind walking. Where vision becomes necessary is for locomotion in challenging\nterrains. In an urban environment, staircases are the most obvious example. In the outdoors, we can\ndeal with rugged terrain such as scrambling over rocks, or stepping from stone to stone to cross a\nstream of water. There is a fair amount of scienti\ufb01c work studying this human capability and showing\ntight coupling of motor control with vision [ 4,5,6]. In this paper, we will develop this capability for\na quadrupedal walking robot equipped with egocentric depth vision. We use a reinforcement learning\napproach trained in simulation, which we are directly able to transfer to the real world. Figure 1 and\nthe accompanying videos shows some examples of our robot walking guided by vision.\nHumans receive an egocentric stream of vision which is used to control feet placement, typically\nwithout conscious planning. As children we acquire it through trial and error [ 7] but for adults it is an\nautomatized skill. Its unconscious execution should not take away from its remarkable sophistication.\nThe footsteps being placed now are based on information collected some time ago. Typically, we\ndon\u2019t look at the ground underneath our feet, rather at the upcoming piece of ground in front of us\na few steps away[ 1,4,5,6]. A short term memory is being created which persists long enough to\nguide foot placement when we are actually over that piece of ground. Finally, note that we learn to\nwalk through bouts of steps, not by executing pre-programmed gaits [7].\nWe take these observations about human walking as design principles for the visually-based walking\ncontroller for an A1 robot. The walking policy is trained by reinforcement learning with a recurrent\nneural network being used as a short term memory of recent egocentric views, proprioceptive states,\nand action history. Such a policy can maintain memory of recent visual information to retrieve\ncharacteristics of the terrain under the robot or below the rear feet, which might no longer be directly\nvisible in the egocentric view.\nIn contrast, prior locomotion techniques rely on the metric elevation map of the terrain around and\nunder the robot [ 8,9,10] to plan foot steps and joint angles. The elevation map is constructed by\nfusing information from multiple depth images (collected over time). This fusion of depth images\ninto a single elevation map requires the relative pose between cameras at different times. Hence,\ntracking is required in the real world to obtain this relative pose using visual or inertial odometry. This\nis challenging because of noise introduced in sensing and odometry, and hence, previous methods. In ICML , 2018.\n[35] J. Tan, T. Zhang, E. Coumans, A. Iscen, Y . Bai, D. Hafner, S.

Typically, the\nsolution is expected to perform well on all encountered tasks, although various metrics expressing\ndifferent requirements are formulated. The popular CL desiderata include reducing the forgetting on\nprevious tasks and increasing the forward transfer on the new tasks, i.e. speeding up the learning\nby reusing knowledge from previous tasks [ 12,46]. Other desiderata focus on limiting resources,\nsuch as the number of samples, computation time, model size, or additional memory size. These\nrequirements are often con\ufb02icting, so usually some trade-offs have to be made [17, 46, 32].\nCombining CL with RL adds another layer of complexity. In this work, we focus on the SAC\nalgorithm [ 16], which is often considered to be the", " Introduction\nReplay Bu\ufb00er Real World \nActor Critic World Model \nFigure 2: Dreamer follows a simple\npipeline for online learning on robot\nhardware without simulators. The cur-\nrent learned policy collects experience\non the robot. This experience is added\nto the replay buffer. The world model is\ntrained on replayed off-policy sequences\nthrough supervised learning. An actor\ncritic algorithm optimizes a neural net-\nwork policy from imagined rollouts in\nthe latent space of the world model. We\nparallelize data collection and neural net-\nwork learning so learning steps can con-\ntinue while the robot is moving and to\nenable low-latency action computation.Teaching robots to solve complex tasks in the real world\nis a foundational problem of robotics research. Deep re-\ninforcement learning (RL) offers a popular approach to\nrobot learning that enables robots to improve their behavior\nover time through trial and error. However, current algo-\nrithms require too much interaction with the environment\nto learn successful behaviors, making them impractical for\nmany real world tasks. Recently, modern world models\nhave shown great promise for data ef\ufb01cient learning in\nsimulated domains and video games (Hafner et al., 2019;\n2020). Learning world models from past experience en-\nables robots to imagine the future outcomes of potential\nactions, reducing the amount of trial and error in the real\nenvironment needed to learn successful behaviors.\nWhile learning accurate world models can be challenging,\nthey offer compelling properties for robot learning. By\npredicting future outcomes, world models allow for plan-\nning and behavior learning given only small amounts of\nreal world interaction (Gal et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2018).\nMoreover, world models summarize general dynamics\nknowledge about the environment that, once learned, could\nbe reused for a wide range of downstream tasks (Sekar\net al., 2020). World models also learn representations that\nfuse multiple sensor modalities and integrate them into la-\ntent states, removing the need for manual state estimation.\nFinally, world models generalize well from available of-\n\ufb02ine data (Yu et al., 2021), which could further accelerate\nlearning in the real world.\nDespite the promises of world models, learning accurate world models for the real world is a big\nopen challenge. In this paper, we leverage recent advances of the Dreamer world model for training a\nvariety of robots in the most straight-forward and fundamental problem setting: online reinforcement\nlearning in the real world, without simulators or demonstrations. As shown in Figure 2, Dreamer\nlearns a world model from a replay buffer of past experience, learns behaviors from rollouts imagined\nin the latent space of the world model, and continuously interacts with the environment to explore\nand improve its behaviors. Our aim is to push the limits of robot learning directly in the real world\nand offer a robust platform to enable future work that develops the bene\ufb01ts of world models for robot\nlearning. The key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u000fDreamer on Robots We apply Dreamer to 4 robots, demonstrating successful learning directly\nin the real world, without introducing new algorithms.

While such\nrepresentations might emerge from end-to-end training [ 7,79,118,125], prior work has found it\nnecessary to equip RL algorithms with perception-speci\ufb01c loss functions [ 31,43,70,74,89,91,101,\n140] or data augmentations [ 72,74,117,136], effectively decoupling the representation learning\nproblem from the reinforcement learning problem. Given what prior work has shown about RL\nin the presence of function approximation and state aliasing [ 2,134,138], it is not surprising that\nend-to-end learning of representations is fragile [ 72,136]: an algorithm needs good representations\nto drive the learning of the RL algorithm, but the RL algorithm needs to drive the learning of good\nrepresentations. So, can we design RL algorithms that do learn good representations without the\nneed for auxiliary perception losses?\nRather than using a reinforcement learning algorithm also to solve a representation learning problem,\nwe will use a representation learning algorithm to also solve certain types of reinforcement learning\nproblems, namely goal-conditioned RL. Goal-conditioned RL is widely studied [ 6,14,21,62,\n80,119], and intriguing from a representation learning perspective because it can be done in an\nentirely self-supervised manner, without manually-speci\ufb01ed reward functions. We will focus on\ncontrastive (representation) learning results suggest that good performance can be\nachieved without this \ufb01ltering step.\nThis section presents additional \ufb01gures.\n\u2022Fig. 13 compares contrastive RL (NCE) with varying values of the \ufb01ltering parameter \u000f,\ndescribed in Sec. 4.5.\n\u2022Fig. 14 \u2013 This plot shows a TSNE embedding of the state-action representations \u001e(s;a)for\none trajectory of the bin picking task.

Early work in this \ufb01eld focused on developing\napproximate dynamics models of a system and then using tra-\njectory optimization algorithms to solve for the actions that\nlead an agent to achieving a desired goal [1]\u2013[4]. However,\nthe resulting controllers tend to be highly specialized for a\nparticular task, limiting their ability to generalize across more\ndiverse tasks or environments. More recently, there has been\na surge in algorithms that use reinforcement learning (RL)\nto learn locomotion behaviors [5]\u2013[9]. This approach proved\nhighly effective in simulation [10], but this success did not\ntranslate to the real world due to challenges associated with\novercoming the simulation to reality gap.\nOne of the main challenges inhibiting RL approaches\nfrom being more effective in the real world is related to\nthe aggressive and overly-energetic behaviors that are often\nlearned by RL agents trained using under-speci\ufb01ed reward\nfunctions. As an example, a legged RL agent trained with\na reward that encourages forward velocity will often learn\nFig. 1. Training with Adversarial Motion Priors encourages the policy to\nproduce behaviors which capture the essence of the motion capture dataset\nwhile satisfying the auxiliary task objective. Only a small amount of motion\ncapture data is required to train the learning system (4.5 seconds in our experiments).\na control policy that exploits \ufb02ailing of the limbs or high-\nimpulse contacts, and other inaccurate simulator dynamics,\nto achieve forward movement. Such behaviors are unlikely to\nbe effective when transferred to a real robot due to actuator\nlimits and potential damage to the robot. To overcome the\nissues posed by reward under-speci\ufb01cation, researchers have\ninvestigated task-speci\ufb01c action spaces [12], [13], complex\nstyle reward formulations [6]\u2013[8], [14], and curriculum learn-\ning [15], [16]. These approaches achieve state-of-the-artarXiv:2203.15103v1  [cs.AI]  28 Mar 2022Fig. 2.

While pacing the COT remains\nconstant with small oscillations. However, when the robot enters a canter phase the COT exhibits spikes corresponding to the robot pushing off its hind\nlegs and troughs corresponding to the \ufb02ight phase where energy consumption is low. This gait transition phenomenon closely relates to the behavior of\nquadrupedal mammals, which modulate their gait according to their speed of travel, leading to minimal energy consumption consumption [11]. results in\na dramatically different COT pro\ufb01le (Fig. 2:D). While the\npace motion exhibits a fairly constant COT, the canter motion\nproduces large spikes in COT corresponding to the lift-off\nphase and relatively low-valued troughs associated with the\n\ufb02ight and touch-down phase.

C ONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrate that learning motion priors using adver-\nsarial imitation learning produces style rewards that encour-\nage the policy to produce behaviors that are grounded in the\nreference motion dataset. Using this", " Introduction\nHow do we train a robot to complete a manipulation task from images? A standard and widely\nused approach is to train an end-to-end model from scratch using data from the same domain [ 1].\nHowever, this can be prohibitively data intensive and severely limits generalization. In contrast,\ncomputer vision and natural language processing (NLP) have recently taken a major departure from\nthis \u201ctabula rasa\u201d paradigm. These \ufb01elds have focused on using diverse, large-scale datasets to build\nreusable, pre-trained representations . Such models have become ubiquitous; for example, visual\nrepresentations from ImageNet [ 2] can be reused for tasks like cancer detection [ 3], and pre-trained\nlanguage embeddings like BERT [ 4] have been used for everything from medical coding [ 5] to visual\nquestion answering [ 6]. Such an equivalent of an ImageNet [ 2] or BERT [ 4] model for robotics, that\ncan be readily downloaded and used for any downstream simulation or real-world manipulation task,\nhas remained elusive.\nWhy have we struggled in building this universal representation for robotics? Our conjecture is that\nwe haven\u2019t converged on using the appropriate datasets for robotics. Collecting large and diverse\ndatasets of robots interacting with the physical world can be costly, even without human annotation.\nRecent attempts at creating such datasets [ 7,8,9,10], consist of a limited number of tasks in at\nmost a handful of different environments. This lack of diversity and scale makes it dif\ufb01cult to learn\nrepresentations that are broadly applicable. At the same time, the recent history of computer vision\nand NLP suggests an alternate route for robotics. The best representations in these \ufb01elds did not\narise out of task-speci\ufb01c and carefully curated datasets, but rather the use of abundant in-the-wild\ndata [ 4,11,12,13]. Analogously, for robotics and motor control, we have access to videos of humans\ninteracting in semantically interesting ways with their environments [ 14,15,16]. This data is large\nand diverse, spanning scenes across the globe, and tasks ranging from folding clothes to cooking a\nmeal. While the embodiment present in this data differs from most robots, prior work [ 17,18] has\nfound that such human video data can still be useful for learning reward functions. Furthermore,\ndomain gap has not been a major barrier for using pre-trained representations in traditional vision and\n6th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2022), Auckland, New Zealand.\n\u0003Work completed during internship at Meta AIarXiv:2203.12601v3  [cs.RO]  18 Nov 2022Ego4D Video + Language\n\u201cstirs the snacks\u2026\u201dTime Contrastive LearningVideo-Language Alignment\n\u201cremoves the battery\u2026\u201d\nPre-Trained R3M RepresentationEfficient Robot Learning New Environment, New T asks\nL1 Sparsity Penalty\ntimeFigure 1: Pre-Training Reusable Representations for Robot Manipulation (R3M) : We pre-train a visual\nrepresentation using diverse human video datasets like Ego4D [ 16], and study its effectiveness for downstream\nrobot manipulation tasks.

In this backdrop, we ask the pertinent question: can visual representations pre-trained on\ndiverse human videos enable ef\ufb01cient downstream learning of robotic manipulation skills?\nWe hypothesize that a good representation for vision-based robotic manipulation consists of three\ncomponents. First, it should contain information necessary for physical interaction, and thus should\ncapture the temporal", "Abstract \u2014 Legged robots are physically capable of travers-\ning a wide range of challenging environments, but designing\ncontrollers that are suf\ufb01ciently robust to handle this diversity\nhas been a long-standing challenge in robotics. Reinforcement\nlearning presents an appealing approach for automating the\ncontroller design process and has been able to produce re-\nmarkably robust controllers when trained in a suitable range\nof environments. However, it is dif\ufb01cult to predict all likely\nconditions the robot will encounter during deployment and\nenumerate them at training-time. What if instead of training\ncontrollers that are robust enough to handle any eventuality,\nwe enable the robot to continually learn in any setting it\n\ufb01nds itself in? This kind of real-world reinforcement learning\nposes a number of challenges, including ef\ufb01ciency, safety, and\nautonomy. To address these challenges, we propose a practical\nrobot reinforcement learning system for \ufb01ne-tuning locomotion\npolicies in the real world. We demonstrate that a modest amount\nof real-world training can substantially improve performance\nduring deployment, and this enables a real A1 quadrupedal\nrobot to autonomously \ufb01ne-tune multiple locomotion skills in a\nrange of environments, including an outdoor lawn and a variety\nof indoor terrains. (Videos and code1)\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nLegged robots possess a unique physical capability to\ntraverse a wide range of environments and terrains, from\nsubterranean rubble to snowy hills [1], [2]. However, fully\nrealizing this capability requires controllers that can effec-\ntively handle this broad range of environments. Engineering\nsuch robust controllers for each robot is a labor-intensive\nprocess, requiring human expertise and precise modeling of\nthe system dynamics [3]\u2013[5]. Reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithms have been used to automatically learn robotic\nlocomotion skills in a wide range of contexts, both in\nsimulation and in the real world [6]\u2013[17]. However, in order\n1https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/\nfine-tuning-locomotionfor thesemethods suffer be-\ncause they assume that a pre-trained encoder or latent space\ncan generalize, which is too strong an assumption when\nthe test environment differs suf\ufb01ciently from the training\nenvironments. RMA especially suffers in this case because it\nrelies entirely on the pre-trained encoder to adapt, and when\nthis encoder fails to generalize, it does not have any other\nrecourse. The latent space method does adapt, but it relies\non the latent space already containing suitable strategies for\nthe new environment and ends up with a suboptimal policy.\nIn contrast, our \ufb01netuning approach is able to continuously\nimprove and eventually succeed.

Tasks such as\nlegged locomotion [1], manipulation [2], and navigation [3], have been solved using these new\ntools, and research continues to keep adding more and more challenging tasks to the list. The\namount of data required to train a policy increases with the task complexity. For this reason, most\nwork focuses on training in simulation before transferring to real robots. We have reached a point\nwhere multiple days or even weeks are needed to fully train an agent with current simulators. For\nexample, OpenAI\u2019s block reorientation task was trained for up to 14 days and their Rubik\u2019s cube\nsolving policy took several months to train [4]. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that deeparXiv:2109.11978v3  [cs.RO]  19 Aug 2022reinforcement learning requires hyper-parameter tuning to obtain a suitable solution which requires\nsequentially rerunning time-consuming training. Reducing training times using massively parallel\napproaches such as presented here can therefore help improve the quality and time-to-deployment\nof DRL policies, as a training setup can be iterated on more often in the same time frame.\nIn this paper, we examine the effects of massive parallelism for on-policy DRL algorithms and\npresent considerations in how the standard RL formulation and the most commonly used hyper-\nparameters should be adapted to learn ef\ufb01ciently in the highly parallel regime. Additionally, we\npresent a novel game-inspired curriculum which automatically adapts the task dif\ufb01culty to the per-\nformance of the policy. The proposed curriculum architecture is straightforward to implement, does\nnot require tuning, and is well suited for the massively parallel regime. Common robotic simulators\nsuch as Mujoco [5], Bullet [6], or Raisim [7] feature ef\ufb01cient multi-body dynamics implementations.\nHowever, they have been developed to run on CPUs with only a reduced amount of parallelism. In\nthis work, we use NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac Gym simulation environment [8], which runs both the simulation\nand training on the GPU and is capable of simulating thousands of robots in parallel.\nThe massively parallel training regime has been explored before [4, 9] in the context of distributed\nsystems with a network of thousands of CPUs each running a separate instance of the simulation.\nThe parallelization was achieved by averaging the gradients between the different workers without\nreducing the number of samples provided by each agent. This results for both \ufb02at and rough terrain tasks. We see that the critic loss is higher\nwithout bootstrapping, and correspondingly, the total reward is lower. Even though learning can be\nsuccessful without this addition, it greatly reduces the critic loss and improves the total reward by\napproximately 10 % to20 % for both tasks.\n(a) Flat Terrain\n(b) Rough Terrain\nFigure 10: Comparison of total reward and critic loss, when training with and without reward boot-\nstrapping on time-outs.\n12A.3 Reward Terms\nJoint positions qj\nJoint velocities _qj\nJoint accelerations \u007fqj\nTarget joint positions \u007fq\u0003\nj\nJoint torques \u001cj\nBase linear velocity vb\nBase angular velocity !b\nCommanded base linear velocity v\u0003\nb\nCommanded base angular velocity !\u0003\nb\nNumber of collisions nc\nFeet air time tair\nEnvironment time step dt\nTable 1: De\ufb01nition of symbols.\nde\ufb01nition weight\nLinear velocity tracking \u001e(v\u0003\nb;xy\u0000vb;xy) 1dt\nAngular velocity tracking \u001e(!\u0003\nb;z\u0000!b;z) 0:5dt\nLinear velocity penalty \u0000v2\nb;z 4dt\nAngular velocity penalty \u0000jj!b;xyjj20:05dt\nJoint motion\u0000jj\u007fqjjj2\u0000jj_qjjj20:001dt\nJoint torques \u0000jj\u001cjjj20:00002dt\nAction rate \u0000jj_q\u0003\njjj20:25dt\nCollisions\u0000ncollision 0:001dt\nFeet air timeP4\nf=0(tair;f\u00000:5) 2dt\nTable 2: De\ufb01nition of reward terms, with \u001e(x) := exp(\u0000jjxjj2\n0:25).

Bottom : Shadow Hand,\nANYmal, Allegro, TriFinger.\nIn recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has become one of the most promising research areas in\nmachine learning and has demonstrated great potential for solving sophisticated decision-making\nproblems. Deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has achieved superhuman performance in very\nchallenging tasks, ranging from classic strategy games such as Go and Chess [ 1], to real-time\ncomputer games like StarCraft [ 2] and DOTA [ 3]. It has also shown impressive Background\n2.1 Parallelization Strategy\nThere are many approaches to parallelizing physics simulations. We outline these approaches here\nand justify our design decisions in the context of GPU-accelerated simulation tailored towards\nlearning algorithms. Isaac Gym was developed to maximize the throughput of physics-based machine\nlearning algorithms with particular emphasis on simulations that require large numbers of environment\ninstances executing in parallel.\n2.1.1 CPU Simulations\nWhen physics simulation runs on CPU, multiple threads can be used to distribute computation among\nthe available cores. The most straightforward strategy is simulating one environment instance per\nthread. In this approach, scaling is limited by the number of physical cores in the system. On a\n64-core hyper-threaded CPU, we could run up to 128 environments in parallel, but CPUs with a large\nnumber of cores are typically clocked lower to prevent overheating. Running tens or hundreds of\nthreads comes with other potential pitfalls including synchronization, context-switching overhead,\nand memory bandwidth limitations. To scale further, we would need to use a multi-CPU setup or\nbuild a cluster, which introduces additional communication overhead.\nRunning a single environment instance per thread in its own dedicated physics scene can be inef\ufb01cient.\nThere is some overhead involved in setting up, executing, and gathering the Appendix A.2.3.\nThe observations are also identical, save for the change in number of \ufb01ngers.\nA.3 Hyperparameters for Training PPO\nEnvironment # Environments KL Threshold Mini-batch Size Horizon Length # PPO Epochs Hidden Units Training Steps\nAnt 4096 8e-3 32768 16 4 256, 128, 64 32M\nHumanoid 4096 8e-3 32768 32 5 400, 200, 100 327M\nIngenuity 4096 1.6 e-2 32768 16 8 256, 256, 128 32M\nANYmal 8192 1e-2 32768 16 5 256, 128, 64 65M\nANYmal Terrain 4096 1e-2 24576 24 10 512, 256, 128 150M\nAMP 4096 2e-1 16384 32 8 1024, 512 39M\nFranka 16384 1.6 e-2 131072 32 4 256, 128, 64 786M\nSH Standard 16384 1.6 e-2 32768 8 5 512, 512, 256, 128 655M\nSH OpenAI FF 16384 1.6 e-2 32768 8 5 400, 400, 200, 100 655M\nSH OpenAI LSTM 8192 1.6 e-2 32768 16 4 lstm: 1024, mlp: 512 925M\nTable 17: Hyperparameters used for training in each environment.

However,\nsuch policies are dif\ufb01cult to transfer to the real world [ 31,39,6].\nOne approach is to directly train in the real world [ 18,55].\nHowever, such policies are limited to very simple setups, and\nscaling to complex setups requires unsafe exploration and a\nlarge number of samples.\nSim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning To achieve complex\nwalking behaviours in the real world using RL, severalAbstract \u2014Successful real-world deployment of legged robots\nwould require them to adapt in real-time to unseen scenarios\nlike changing terrains, changing payloads, wear and tear. This\npaper presents Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) algorithm to\nsolve this problem of real-time online adaptation in quadruped\nrobots. RMA consists of two components: a base policy and an\nadaptation module. The combination of these components enables\nthe robot to adapt to novel situations in fractions of a second.\nRMA is trained completely in simulation without using any\ndomain knowledge like reference trajectories or prede\ufb01ned foot\ntrajectory generators and is deployed on the A1 robot without\nany \ufb01ne-tuning. We train RMA on a varied terrain generator\nusing bioenergetics-inspired rewards and deploy it on a variety of\ndif\ufb01cult terrains including rocky, slippery, deformable surfaces\nin environments with grass, long vegetation, concrete, pebbles,\nstairs, sand, etc. RMA shows state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse real-world as well as simulationexperiments in Figure 4 of the\nmain paper, we also analyze the gait patterns and the torque\npro\ufb01le for the mass adaptation case, shown in Figure S3.

Given the diversity of successful applications of such models, we seek to\nexamine their application to sequential decision making problems formalized as reinforcement\nlearning (RL). In contrast to prior work using transformers as an architectural choice for components\nwithin traditional RL algorithms [ 4,5], we seek to study if generative trajectory modeling \u2013 i.e.\nmodeling the joint distribution of the sequence of states, actions, and rewards \u2013 can serve as a\nreplacement for conventional RL algorithms.\nWe consider the following shift in paradigm: instead of training a policy through conventional\nRL algorithms like temporal difference (TD) learning [ 6], we will train transformer models on\ncollected experience using a sequence modeling objective. This will allow us to bypass the need for\nbootstrapping for long term credit assignment \u2013 thereby avoiding one of the \u201cdeadly triad\u201d [ 6] known\nto destabilize RL. It also avoids the need for discounting future rewards, as typically done in TD\nlearning, which can induce undesirable short-sighted behaviors. Additionally, we can make use of\nexisting transformer frameworks widely used in language and vision that are easy to scale, utilizing a\nlarge body of work studying stable training of transformer models.\nIn addition to their demonstrated ability to model long sequences, transformers also have other\nadvantages. Transformers can perform credit assignment directly via self-attention, in contrast to\nBellman backups which slowly propagate rewards and are prone to \u201cdistractor\u201d signals [ 7]. This can\nenable transformers to still work effectively in the presence of sparse or distracting rewards. Finally,\nempirical evidence suggest that a transformer modeling approach can model a wide distribution of\nbehaviors, enabling better generalization and transfer [3].\nWe explore our hypothesis by considering of\ufb02ine RL, where we will task agents with learning policies\nfrom suboptimal data \u2013 producing maximally effective behavior from \ufb01xed, limited experience. This\ntask is traditionally challenging due to error propagation and value overestimation [ 8]. However, it is\na natural task when training with a sequence modeling objective. By training an autoregressive model\non sequences of states, actions, and returns, we reduce policy sampling to autoregressive generative\nmodeling. We can specify the expertise of the policy \u2013 which \u201cskill\u201d to query \u2013 by selecting the\ndesired return tokens, acting as a prompt for generation.\nIllustrative example. To get an intuition for our proposal, consider the task of \ufb01nding the shortest\npath on a directed graph, which can be posed as an RL problem. The reward is 0when the agent is\nat the goal node and \u00001otherwise. We train a GPT [ 9] model to predict next token in a sequence\nof returns-to-go (sum of future rewards), states, and actions. Training only on random walk data \u2013\nwith no expert demonstrations \u2013 we can generate optimal trajectories at test time by adding a prior\nto generate highest possible returns (see more details and empirical Discussion\n5.1 Does Decision Transformer perform behavior cloning on a subset of the data?\nIn this section, we seek to gain insight into whether Decision Transformer can be thought of as\nperforming imitation learning on a subset of the data with a certain return. To investigate", " Introduction\nIn this supplementary material, we list some detailed re-\nsults of our paper including: (1)The proof of monotonicity\nof entropy with respect to temperature coeffecient \u03c4.(2)\nAll numerical methods and the corresponding forms of mutual informa-\ntion. Wang et al [31] try to understand the contrastive learn-\ning by two key properties, the alignment and uniformity.\nDifferent from the above works, we focus mainly on the\ninherent properties of the contrastive loss function. We em-\nphasize the signi\ufb01cance of the temperature \u03c4, and use it as a\nproxy to analyze some intriguing phenomenons of the con-\ntrastive learning.\n3. Hardness-aware Property\nGiven an unlabeled training set X={x1,...,xN}, the\ncontrastive loss is formulated as:\nL(xi) =\u2212log/bracketleftBigg\nexp(si,i/\u03c4)/summationtext\nk/negationslash=iexp(si,k/\u03c4) + exp(si,i/\u03c4)/bracketrightBigg\n(1)\nwheresi,j=f(xi)Tg(xj).f(\u00b7)is a feature extractor which\nmaps the images from pixel space to a hypersphere space.\ng(\u00b7)is a function which can be same as f[4], or comes from\na memory bank [33], momentum queue [10], etc. For con-\nvenience, we de\ufb01ne the probability of xibeing recognized\nasxjas:\nPi,j=exp(si,j/\u03c4)/summationtext\nk/negationslash=iexp(si,k/\u03c4) + exp(si,i/\u03c4)(2)\nThe contrastive loss tries to make the positive pairs at-\ntracted and the negative samples separated, i.e., the positive\nalignment and negative separation. This objective can also\nbe achieved by using a more simple contrastive loss as:\nLsimple (xi) =\u2212si,i+\u03bb/summationdisplay\ni/negationslash=jsi,j (3)\nHowever, we \ufb01nd that the above loss function performs\nmuch worse than the softmax-based contrastive loss of Eq\n1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0050\u00d7103\n = 0.07\n = 0.20\n = 0.30\n = 1.00\nFigure 3. The gradient ratio ri,jwith respect to different si,j. We\nsample the si,jfrom a uniform distribution in [\u22121,1]. As we can\nsee, with lower temperature, the contrastive loss tends to punish\nmore on the hard negative samples.\n1. In the following parts, we will show that different with\nLsimple , the softmax-based contrastive loss is a hardness-\naware loss function, which automatically concentrates on\nseparating more informative negative samples to make the\nembedding distribution more uniform. Besides, we also \ufb01nd\nthat theLsimple is a special case by approaching the temper-\nature\u03c4to+\u221e. Next, we will start with a gradient analysis\nto explain the properties of the contrastive loss.\n3.1. Gradients Analysis.\nWe analyze the gradients with respect to positive sam-\nples and different negative samples. We will show that the\nmagnitude of positive gradient is equal to the sum of nega-\ntive gradients. The temperature controls the distribution of\nnegative gradients. Smaller temperature tends to concen-\ntrate more on the nearest neighbours of the anchor point,\nwhich plays a role in controlling the hardness-aware sensi-\ntivity. Speci\ufb01cally, the gradients with respect to the positive\nsimilaritysi,iand the negative similarity si,j(j/negationslash=i) are\nformulated as:\n\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,i=\u22121\n\u03c4/summationdisplay\nk/negationslash=iPi,k,\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,j=1\n\u03c4Pi,j (4)\nFrom Eq 4, we have the following observations: (1) The\ngradients with respect to negative samples is proportional\nto the exponential term exp(si,j/\u03c4), indicating that the con-\ntrastive loss is a hardness-aware loss function, which is dif-\nferent with the loss of Eq 3 that gives all negative similar-\nities the same magnitude of gradients. (2) The magnitude\nof gradient with respect to positive sample is equal to the\nsum of gradients with respect to all negative samples, i.e.,\n(/summationtext\nk/negationslash=i|\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,k|)/|\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,i|= 1, which can de\ufb01ne a proba-\nbilistic distribution to help understand the role of tempera-\nture\u03c4.\n3.2. The Role of temperature\nThe temperature plays a role in controlling the strength\nof penalties on hard negative samples. Speci\ufb01cally, we de-\n\ufb01neri(si,j) =|\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,j|/|\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,i|, representing the relative\n3penalty on negative sample xj. We have:\nri(si,j) =exp(si,j/\u03c4)/summationtext\nk/negationslash=iexp(si,k/\u03c4), i/negationslash=j (5)\nwhich obeys the Boltzman distribution. As the temperature\n\u03c4decreases, the entropy of the distribution H(ri)decreases\nstrictly (the", " Introduction\nRecently there has been steady progress in un-/self-\nsupervised representation learning, with encouraging re-\nsults on multiple visual tasks ( e.g., [2, 17, 8, 15, 7]). Despite\nvarious original motivations, these methods with the original papers\u2019 Related Work\nSiamese networks. Siamese networks [4] are general mod-\nels for comparing entities. Their applications include sig-\nnature [4] and face [34] veri\ufb01cation, tracking [3], one-shot\nlearning [23], and others. In conventional use cases, the in-\nputs to Siamese networks are from different images, and the\ncomparability is determined by supervision.\nContrastive learning. The core idea of contrastive learn-\ning [16] is to attract the positive sample pairs and repulse the\nnegative sample pairs. This methodology has been recently\npopularized for un-/self-supervised representation learning\n[36, 30, 20, 37, 21, 2, 35, 17, 29, 8, 9]. Simple and effective\ninstantiations of contrastive learning have been developed\nusing Siamese networks [37, 2, 17, 8, 9].\nIn practice, contrastive learning Discussion\nOur hypothesis is about what the optimization problem\ncan be. It does not explain why collapsing is prevented.\nWe point out that SimSiam and its variants\u2019 non-collapsing\nbehavior still remains as an empirical observation.\nHere we brie\ufb02y discuss our understanding on this open\nquestion. The alternating optimization provides a different\ntrajectory, and the trajectory depends on the initialization.\nIt is unlikely that the initialized \u0011, which is the output of a\nrandomly initialized network, would be a constant. Starting\nfrom this initialization, it may be dif\ufb01cult for the alternating\noptimizer to approach a constant \u0011xfor allx, because the\nmethod does notcompute the gradients w.r.t. \u0011jointly for\nallx. The optimizer seeks another trajectory (Figure 2 left),\nin which the outputs are scattered (Figure 2 middle).\n6. Comparisons\n6.1. Result Comparisons\nImageNet. We compare with the state-of-the-art frame-\nworks in Table 4 on ImageNet linear evaluation. For fair\ncomparisons, all competitors are based on our reproduc-\ntion, and \u201c+\u201d denotes improved reproduction vs. the original\npapers (see supplement). For each individual method, we\nfollow the hyper-parameter and augmentation recipes in its\noriginal paper.6All entries are based on a standard ResNet-\n50, with two 224\u0002224 views used during pre-training.\n6In our BYOL reproduction, the 100, 200(400), 800-epoch recipes fol-\nlow the 100, 300, 1000-epoch recipes in [15]: lrisf0.45, 0.3, 0.2g,wdis\nf1e-6, 1e-6, 1.5e-6g, and momentum coef\ufb01cient is f0.99, 0.99, 0.996g.Table 4 shows the introduction of the stop-gradient and extra predictor is\npresumably a consequence of another underlying optimiza-\ntion problem. It is different from the contrastive learning\nproblem, so these extra components may not be helpful.\nRelation to SwA V [7]. SimSiam is conceptually analogous\nto \u201cSwA V without online clustering\u201d. We build up this\nconnection by recasting a few components in SwA V . (i)\nThe shared prototype layer in SwA V can be absorbed\ninto the Siamese encoder. (ii) The prototypes were\nweight-normalized outside of gradient propagation in [7];\nwe instead implement by full gradient computation [33].8\n(iii) The similarity function in SwA V is cross-entropy. With\nthese abstractions, a highly simpli\ufb01ed SwA V illustration is\nshown in Figure 3.\nSwA V applies the Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) transform [10]\non the target branch (which is also symmetrized [7]). The\nSK transform is derived from online clustering [7]: it is\nthe outcome of clustering the current batch subject to a bal-\nanced partition constraint. The balanced partition can avoid\ncollapsing. Our method does not involve this transform.\nWe study the effect of the prediction MLP hand stop-\ngradient on SwA V .

Blue indicates policies that perform similarly to the corresponding policy with default settings. Green and red\nindicate policies that perform better or worse than the default, respectively. Policies without velocity feedback or with\nkp= 160 all fail the sim-to-real tests. They also generally perform worse in the robustness tests compared to default.\nA. Dynamics Randomization Produces Conservative Policies\nWe observe in TABLE III that dynamics randomization\ncan sometimes lead to policies that are overly-conservative\nin order to achieve unnecessary robustness in parameters\nthat are being randomized. For example, the pacing policies\ntrained with no velocity feedback and dynamics randomiza-\ntion perform worse than policies trained without dynamics\nrandomization in general, except in terms of dealing with\nlatency. However, the physical robot system has an estimated\nlatency of less than 4 ms, and this unnecessary robustness\nagainst increased latency leads to compromised performance\nand robustness along other dimensions.\nWe further train trotting policies under the default setting\nwith dynamics randomization. We observe a more con-\nservative maximum speed (0.9 m/s with randomization and\n1.1 m/s with no randomization), both in simulation and on\nthe physical robot. This also corresponds to our intuition that\ndynamics randomization can produce conservative policies.\nB. Randomize Parameters that Matter\nWe use the latency test to investigate the usefulness of\ndynamics randomization. We observe that policies trained\nwithout randomization fail when the latency exceeds 17 ms.\nWe train another policy with randomized latency only; more\nspeci\ufb01cally, the policy is trained with randomized latency of\nup to 20 ms. The resulting policy can handle latency up to\n32 ms, both in simulation and on the physical robot.\nThis indicates that dynamics randomization can help in\nscenarios where signi\ufb01cant modeling errors are present, such\nas latency in the system. In these scenarios, dynamics ran-\ndomization provides a useful mechanism to cross the reality\ngap by only randomizing the parameters that are responsible.\nC. Summary\nWe observe that blindly applying dynamics randomization\nwhen it is not necessary can generate suboptimal policies that\nare too conservative. However, if the system has fundamental\nmodeling errors that hinder sim-to-real success, randomiza-\ntion is needed to cross the reality gap, as shown in our latencyexperiments. We note that actuator modeling errors can also\npose a sim-to-real challenge, as noted in [4], where a learned\nactuator model is employed to cross the reality gap.\nIn summary, we suggest employing dynamic randomiza-\ntion or additional modeling only when signi\ufb01cant modeling\nerrors are present and to only randomize or model parametersthat matter. Super\ufb02uous dynamics randomization harms", " INTRODUCTION\nLegged locomotion can dramatically expand the reach of robotics.\nMuch of the dry landmass on Earth remains impassible to wheeled and\ntracked machines, the stability of which can be severely compromised\non challenging terrain. Quadrupedal animals, on the other hand, can\naccess some of the most remote parts of our planet. They can choose\nsafe footholds within their kinematic reach and rapidly change their\nkinematic state in response to the environment. Legged robots have the\npotential to traverse any terrain that their animal counterparts can.\nTo date, no published work has demonstrated dynamic locomotion\nin diverse, challenging natural environments as shown in Fig. 1. These\nenvironments have highly irregular pro\ufb01les, deformable terrain, slip-\npery surfaces, and overground obstructions. Under such conditions,\nexisting published controllers manifest frequent foot slippage, loss of\nbalance, and ultimately catastrophic failure. The challenge is exacer-\nbated by the inaccessibility of veridical information about the physical\nproperties of the terrain. Exteroceptive sensors such as cameras and\nLiDAR cannot reliably measure physical characteristics such as friction\nand compliance, are impeded by obstructions such as vegetation, snow,\nand water, and may not have the coverage and temporal resolution to\ncapture changes induced by the robot itself, such as the crumbling of\nloose ground under the robot\u2019s feet. Under these conditions, the robot\nmust rely crucially on proprioception \u2013 the sensing of its own bodilycon\ufb01guration at high temporal resolution. In response to unforeseen\nevents such as unexpected ground contact, terrain deformation, and\nfoot slippage, the controller must rapidly produce whole-body trajecto-\nries subject to multiple objectives: balancing, avoiding self-collision,\ncounteracting external disturbances, and locomotion. While animals\ninstinctively solve this complex control problem, it is an open challenge\nin robotics.\nConventional approaches to legged locomotion on uneven terrain\nhave yielded increasingly complex control architectures. Many rely\non elaborate state machines that coordinate the execution of motion\nprimitives and re\ufb02ex controllers [ 1\u20135]. To trigger transitions between\nstates or the execution of a re\ufb02ex, many systems explicitly estimate\nstates such as ground contact and slippage [ 6\u20138]. Such estimation\nis commonly based on empirically tuned thresholds and can become\nerratic in the presence of unmodeled factors such as mud, snow, or\nvegetation. Other systems employ contact sensors at the feet, which\ncan become unreliable in \ufb01eld conditions [ 9\u201311]. Overall, conventional\nsystems for legged locomotion on rough terrain escalate in complexity\nas more scenarios are taken into account, have become extremely\nlaborious to develop and maintain, and remain vulnerable to corner\ncases.\nModel-free reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as\nan alternative approach in the development of legged locomotion\nskills [ 12\u201314]. The idea of RL is to tune a controller to optimize aarXiv:2010.11251v1  [cs.RO]  21 Oct 2020Research Article ETH Zurich and Intel 2\nFig. 1.

The optimization is performed on data acquired\nby executing the controller itself, which improves with experience.\nRL has been used to simplify the design of locomotion controllers,\nautomate parts of the design process, and learn behaviors that could\nnot be engineered with prior approaches [12\u201315].\nHowever, application of RL to legged locomotion has largely been\ncon\ufb01ned to laboratory environments and conditions.

While it is obvious\nthat some criteria for usefulness depend on the task, it is also\nuniversally assumed that there are sets of features that are\nrepresentative of a dataset and that are generally useful as\ninput for many kinds of downstream classi\u001cer or predictor.\nFocusing explicitly on learning representation in some cases\ncan be bene\u001ccial, for example, when a labelled dataset for\na task is small and we want to leverage a larger unlabelled\ndataset to improve the performance of a learning system.\nRepresentation learning refers to the process of learning\na parametric mapping from the raw input data domain to\na feature vector or tensor, in the hope of capturing and\nextracting more abstract\nstate representation. The graph Neural network heads then\ntransform the state's representations and its corresponding\nactions (represented as one-hot vectors) into the state repre-\nsentation in the next time step. Similar to TransE, the statetransitions between time steps is modeled as a translation in\nthe embedding space and the entire world model is trained\nend-to-end with an energy-based hinge loss.\nFocusing on learning useful node representations from\ngeneral graphs, node2vec [35] aims to learn a node repre-\nsentation that is similar between neighbour nodes. The key\ncontribution of node2vec is a family of biased random walk introduction of the Skip-gram and CBOW algo-\nrithms [68] to learn word representations which depend heav-\nily on the tree structure of the hierarchical softmax, Mnih andKavukcuoglu [70] used NCE to avoid having to compute the\nnormalisation term of the softmax. Also inspired by NCE,\nMikolov et al. [67] proposed a slightly different method\ncalled Negative Sampling (NEG) that focuses solely on learn-\ning good word representations with the trade-off of losing the\nprobabilistic properties from NCE.\nRecently, the Bidirectional Encoder Representation\nfrom Transformer (BERT) [24] model learns bidirectional\nword representations using the Transformer architecture's\ndecoder [103] and demonstrated great performance for trans-\nfer learning in multiple downstream tasks. XLNet [116] mod-\ni\u001ced BERT's masked language model objective to include\nan autoregressive objective. While these language model\nobjectives are usually referred to as a form of denoising\nautoencoder that try to reconstruct the original input, in the\ncase of learning word embeddings which is just a lookup\nlayer from index to vector, there is no difference between\nreconstructing and contrasting between feature vectors and\nthus this work does fall under the remit of being a form of\ncontrastive learning.\nUnder the mutual information maximisation framework,\nKong et al. [61] showed that BERT or XLnet also maximise\nglobal-local mutual information, whereas the next sentence\nprediction pre-training task can be seen as constructing simi-\nlarity pairs using the sequential coherence property. With this\ninsight, Kong et al. [61] also proposed BERT-NCE, a variant\nof BERT that uses an NCE-based loss instead of the full\nVOLUME 8, 2020 15P. H.

Several such deep RL algorithms have matured\n(Hessel et al., 2018; Schulman et al., 2017; Mnih et al., 2016;\n1University of California, Berkeley. Correspondence to:\nAdam Stooke <adam.stooke@berkeley.edu >, Michael Laskin\n<mlaskin@berkeley.edu >.\nProceedings of the 38thInternational Conference on Machine\nLearning , PMLR 139, 2021. Copyright 2021 by the author(s).Haarnoja et al., 2018) and have been successfully applied\nto domains ranging from real-world (Levine et al., 2016;\nKalashnikov et al., 2018) and simulated robotics (Lee et al.,\n2019; Laskin et al., 2020a; Hafner et al., 2020) to sophis-\nticated video games (Berner et al., 2019; Jaderberg et al.,\n2019), and even high-\ufb01delity driving simulators (Dosovit-\nskiy et al., 2017). While the simplicity of end-to-end meth-\nods is appealing, relying on the reward function to learn\nvisual features can be severely limiting. For example, it\nleaves features dif\ufb01cult to acquire under sparse rewards, and\nit can narrow their utility to a single task. Although our\nintent is broader than to focus on either sparse-reward or\nmulti-task settings, they arise naturally in our studies. We\ninvestigate how to learn visual representations which are\nagnostic to rewards, without degrading the control policy.\nA number of recent works have signi\ufb01cantly improved RL\nperformance by introducing auxiliary losses, which are un-\nsupervised tasks that provide feature-learning signal to the\nconvolution neural network (CNN) encoder, additionally\nto the RL loss (Jaderberg et al., 2017; van den Oord et al.,\n2018; Laskin et al., 2020b; Guo et al., 2020; Schwarzer\net al., 2020). Meanwhile, in the \ufb01eld of computer vision,\nrecent efforts in unsupervised and self-supervised learning\n(Chen et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; He et al., 2019) have\ndemonstrated that powerful feature extractors can be learned\nwithout labels, as evidenced by their usefulness for down-\nstream tasks such as ImageNet classi\ufb01cation. Together,\nthese advances suggest that visual features for RL could\npossibly be learned entirely without rewards, which would\ngrant greater \ufb02exibility to improve overall learning perfor-\nmance. To our knowledge, however, no single unsupervised\nlearning (UL) task has been shown adequate for this purpose\nin general vision-based environments.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the \ufb01rst decoupling of rep-\nresentation learning from reinforcement learning that per-\nforms as well as or better than end-to-end RL. We update\nthe encoder weights using only UL and train a control policy\nindependently, on the (compressed) latent images. This ca-\npability stands in contrast to previous state-of-the-art meth-\nods, which have trained the UL and RL objectives jointly,\nor (Laskin et al., 2020b), which observed diminished perfor-\nmance with decoupled encoders.\nOur main enabling contribution is a new unsupervised taskarXiv:2009.08319v3  [cs.LG]  16 May 2021Decoupling Representation Learning from Reinforcement Learning\ntailored to reinforcement learning, which we call Aug-\nmented Temporal Contrast (ATC). ATC requires a model\nto associate observations from nearby time steps within the\nsame trajectory (Anand et al., 2019). Observations are en-\ncoded via a convolutional neural network (shared with the\nRL agent) into a small latent space, where the InfoNCE\nloss is applied (van den Oord et al., 2018). Within each\nrandomly sampled training batch, the positive observation,\not+k, for every anchor, ot, serves as negative for all other\nanchors. For regularization, observations undergo stochastic\ndata augmentation (Laskin et al., 2020b) prior", " Introduction\nFigure 1: Our SupCon loss consistently outper-\nforms cross-entropy with standard data augmenta-\ntions. We show top-1 accuracy for the ImageNet\ndataset, on ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and ResNet-\n200, and compare against AutoAugment [5], Ran-\ndAugment [6] and CutMix [60].The cross-entropy loss is the most widely used loss\nfunction for supervised learning of deep classi\ufb01ca-\ntion models. A number of works have explored\nshortcomings of this loss, such as lack of robustness\nto noisy labels [64, 46] and the possibility of poor\nmargins [10, 31], leading to reduced generalization\nperformance. However, in practice, most proposed\nalternatives have not worked better for large-scale\ndatasets, such as ImageNet [7], as evidenced by the\ncontinued use of cross-entropy to achieve state of the\nart results for more optimizers and data augmentation strategies. Added SupCon loss\nhierarchy. Adjusted table reporting for clarity.\nVersion 3 (2020-10-13) Removed deprecated sentence from Related Work\nOur work draws on existing literature in self-supervised representation learning, metric learning\nand supervised learning. Here we focus on the most relevant papers. The cross-entropy loss was\nintroduced as a powerful loss function to train deep networks [40, 1, 29]. The key idea is simple\nand intuitive: each class is assigned a target (usually 1-hot) vector. However, it is unclear why\nthese target labels should be the optimal ones and some work has tried to identify better target label\nvectors, e.g. [57]. A number of papers have studied other drawbacks of the cross-entropy loss,\nsuch as sensitivity to noisy labels [64, 46], presence of adversarial examples [10, 36], and poor\nmargins [2]. Alternative losses have been proposed, but the most effective ideas in practice have\nbeen approaches that change the reference label distribution, such as label smoothing [47, 35], data\naugmentations such as Mixup [61] and CutMix [60], and knowledge distillation [21].\nPowerful self-supervised representation learning approaches based on deep learning models have\nrecently been developed in the natural language domain [8, 58, 33]. In the image domain, pixel-\npredictive approaches have also been used to learn embeddings [9, 62, 63, 37]. These methods consistently outperform cross entropy for varying strengths of augmentation.\n2215 Change Log\nVersion 1 (2020-04-23) Initial Arxiv version.\nVersion 2 (2020-10-22) Added analysis of different forms of supervised contrastive loss and its\ngradients as well as experimental experiments.

In all other agents, where older experiences were maintained for longer in the buffer, the\nforgetting process is slower. This does not seem to be qualitatively different for the MTR-IRM agent\n- it just seems to be able to reach a good balance between achieving a high performance in the various\nsettings, while forgetting slowly. In particular, it is hard to identify whether there has been much\nforward transfer to gravity settings that have yet to be trained on, which one might hope for by\nlearning an invariant policy: at the beginning of training, the extra IRM constraints seem to inhibit\nthe progress on all settings (as compared to the standard IRM agent), but in the latter stages the\nperformance on a number of the later settings improves drastically.\n(a) FIFO\n (b) Reservoir\n (c) Half Reservoir Half FIFO\n(d) MTR\n (e) MTR with IRM\nFigure A.1: Individual Evaluation rewards for linearly increasing gravity HalfCheetah.

If we assume the cascade is full, then the\nprobability of an experience being pushed into the kthsub-buffer is \fmtrk\u00001, since, for this to happen,\none must be pushed from the 1stto the 2ndwith probability \fmtr, and another from the 2ndto the\n3rdwith the same probability, and so on. So, in expectation,N\nnb\u00011\n\fmtrk\u00001new experiences must be\nadded to the database for an experience to move from the beginning to the end of the kthsub-buffer.\nThus, if an experience reaches the end of the kthbuffer, then the expected number of time steps that\n11(a) Training performance\n (b) Evaluation", " Introduction to reinforcement learning ,\nvolume 135. 1998.\nSzegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y ., Sermanet, P., Reed, S.,\nAnguelov, D., Erhan, D., Vanhoucke, V ., and Rabinovich,\nA.

(2018), and implement all other functions as three dense\nlayers of size 300with ELU activations (Clevert et al., 2015). Distributions in latent space are\n30-dimensional diagonal Gaussians. The action model outputs a tanh mean scaled by a factor of\n5 and a softplus standard deviation for the Normal distribution that is then transformed using tanh\n(Haarnoja et al., 2018). The scaling factor allows the agent to saturate the action distribution.\nLearning updates We draw batches of 50 sequences of length 50 to train the world model, value\nmodel, and action model models using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with learning rates 6\u000210\u00004,\n8\u000210\u00005,8\u000210\u00005, respectively and scale down gradient norms that exceed 100. We do not scale\nthe KL regularizers ( \f= 1) but clip them below 3free nats as in PlaNet. The imagination horizon is\nH= 15 and the same trajectories are used to update both action and value models. We compute the\nV\u0015targets with \r= 0:99and\u0015= 0:95. We did not \ufb01nd latent overshooting for learning the model,\nan entropy bonus for the action model, or target networks for the value model necessary.\nEnvironment interaction The dataset is initialized with S= 5episodes collected using random\nactions.

These techniques\nmade manually speci\ufb01ed features largely redundant and have greatly improved state-of-the-art in\nseveral real-world applications [ 1,2,3]. However, many challenges remain, such as data ef\ufb01ciency,\nrobustness or generalization.\nImproving representation learning requires features that are less specialized towards solving a\nsingle supervised task. For example, when pre-training a model to do image classi\ufb01cation, the\ninduced features transfer reasonably well to other image classi\ufb01cation domains, but also lack certain\ninformation such as color or the ability to count that are irrelevant for classi\ufb01cation but relevant for\ne.g. image captioning [ 4]. Similarly, features that are useful to transcribe human speech may be\nless suited for speaker identi\ufb01cation, or music genre prediction. Thus, unsupervised learning is an\nimportant stepping stone towards robust and generic representation learning.\nDespite its importance, unsupervised learning is yet to see a breakthrough similar to supervised\nlearning: modeling high-level representations from raw observations remains elusive. Further, it\nis not always clear what the ideal representation is and if it is possible that one can learn such a\nrepresentation without additional supervision or specialization to a particular data modality.\nOne of the most common strategies for unsupervised learning has been to predict future, missing or\ncontextual information. This idea of predictive coding [ 5,6] is one of the oldest techniques in signal\nprocessing for data compression. In neuroscience, predictive coding theories suggest that the brain\npredicts observations at various levels of abstraction [ 7,8]. Recent work in unsupervised learning\nhas successfully used these ideas to learn word representations by predicting neighboring words [ 9].\nFor images, predicting color from grey-scale or the relative position of image patches has also been\nPreprint.

We hypothesize that these approaches are fruitful partly because the context\nfrom which we predict related values are often conditionally dependent on the same shared high-level\nlatent information. And by casting this as a prediction problem, we automatically infer these features\nof interest to representation learning.\nIn this paper we propose the following: \ufb01rst, we compress high-dimensional data into a much more\ncompact latent embedding space in which conditional predictions are easier to model. Secondly, we\nuse powerful autoregressive models in this latent space to make predictions many steps in the future.\nFinally, we rely on Noise-Contrastive Estimation [ 12] for the loss function in similar ways that have\nbeen used for learning word embeddings in natural language models, allowing for the whole model\nto be trained end-to-end. We apply the resulting model, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) to\nwidely different data modalities, images, speech, natural language and reinforcement learning, and\nshow that the same mechanism learns interesting high-level information on each of these domains,\noutperforming other approaches.\n2 Contrastive Predicting Coding\nWe start this section by motivating and giving intuitions behind our approach. Next, we introduce the\narchitecture of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). After that we explain the loss function that is\nbased on Noise-Contrastive Estimation. Lastly, we discuss related", "Abstract \u2014Designing agile locomotion for quadruped robots\noften requires extensive expertise and tedious manual tuning.\nIn this paper, we present a system to automate this process by\nleveraging deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our system\ncan learn quadruped locomotion from scratch using simple\nreward signals. In addition, users can provide an open loop\nreference to guide the learning process when more control over\nthe learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a\nphysics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics,\npolicies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real\nworld. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics\nsimulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation\nusing system identi\ufb01cation, developing an accurate actuator\nmodel and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by\nrandomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations\nand designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our\nsystem on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping.\nAfter learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully\nperform both gaits in the real world.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nDesigning agile locomotion for quadruped robots is a long-\nstanding research problem [1]. This is because it is dif\ufb01cult to\ncontrol an under-actuated robot performing highly dynamic\nmotion that involve intricate balance. Classical approaches\noften require extensive experience and tedious manual tuning\n[2, 3]. Can we automate this process?\nRecently, we have seen tremendous progress in deep rein-\nforcement learning (deep RL) [4, 5, 6]. These algorithms can\nsolve locomotion problems from scratch without much human\nintervention. However, most of these studies are conducted\nin simulation, and a controller learned in simulation often\nperforms poorly in the real world. This reality gap [7, 8]\nis caused by model discrepancies between the simulated and\nthe real physical system. Many factors, including unmodeled\ndynamics, wrong simulation parameters, and numerical errors,\ncontribute to this gap. Even worse, this gap is greatly ampli\ufb01ed\nin locomotion tasks. When a robot performs agile motion with\nfrequent contact changes, the switches of contact situations\nbreak the control space into fragmented pieces. Any small\nmodel discrepancy can be magni\ufb01ed and generate bifurcated\nconsequences. Overcoming the reality gap is challenging.\nAn alternative is to learn the task directly on the physical\nsystem. While this has been successfully demonstrated in\nrobotic grasping [9], it is challenging to apply this method\nFig. 1: The simulated and the real Minitaurs learned to gallop\nusing deep reinforcement learning.\nto locomotion tasks due to the dif\ufb01culties of automatically\nresetting theexperiments for model learning and policy optimization.\nInRobotics and Automation (ICRA), 2015 IEEE Inter-\nnational Conference on , pages 2620\u20132626.

In Intelligent", " Introduction\nLifelong machine learning (Thrun 1996) examines learning\nmultiple tasks in sequence, with an emphasis on how pre-\nvious knowledge of different tasks can be used to improve\nthe training time and learning of current tasks. The hope is\nthat, if sequential learning can be repeated inde\ufb01nitely, then\na system can continue to learn over the course of its lifetime.\nA continual learning agent is thought to be an important step\ntoward general arti\ufb01cial intelligence.\nRecent advances in deep learning continue to motivate re-\nsearch into neural networks that can learn multiple tasks.\nSome approaches include training separate networks for\neach task (Rusu et al. 2016; Yin and Pan 2017) and discov-\nering action hierarchies (Tessler et al. 2016), but these meth-\nods become inef\ufb01cient when scaling to multiple tasks. Ef\ufb01-\nciently retaining knowledge for every task over the course\nof a system\u2019s lifetime is a core dif\ufb01culty in implementing a\nsuch a network. When learning multiple tasks in sequence,\neach new task changes the distribution of experiences, the\noptima move, and a large set of states are no longer visited.\nAs a result of the non-stationary training distribution, the\nnetwork loses its ability to perform well in previous tasks in\nCopyright c\r2018, Association for the Advancement of Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

A network\nmay experience forgetting on a single task if rarely occur-\nring events fall out of the buffer (Lipton et al. 2016) or if\nthe network converges to behavior that does not consistently\nvisit the state space (de Bruin et al. 2015). This can be miti-\ngated by having a replay buffer with limitless capacity or, if\nthe task boundaries are known a priori, by maintaining sep-\narate buffers for each task. However, as the number of tasks\ngrows large, storing all experiences of all tasks becomes pro-\nhibitively expensive, and ultimately infeasible for lifelong\nlearning.\nIn this paper, we develop a process for accumulating ex-\nperiences online that enables their long term retention given\nlimited memory. We treat preserving prior ability as an ac-\ntive process where replay of prior tasks are incorporated into\nthe current learning process. In order to ef\ufb01ciently store prior\nexperiences, we propose a rank-based method for the online\ncollection and preservation of a limited set of training ex-\namples to reduce the effects of forgetting. We then explore\nfour different selection strategies to identify a good ranking\nfunction for selecting the experiences. To validate the selec-\ntion process, we apply each strategy to an autonomous driv-\ning domain where different tasks correspond to navigating\ndifferent unsigned intersections. This domain has recently\nbeen analyzed as a multi-task setting that both bene\ufb01ts from\ntransfer and allows for the speci\ufb01cation of a large variety\nof tasks (Isele and Cosgun 2017). We additionally show our experiments, but\nwith only two sequential tasks rather than \ufb01ve in order to\ntest the hypothesis. Both networks were trained on right task\n\ufb01rst, then on challenge task for 12.5 times longer.\nThe methods still displayed\ncatastrophic forgetting, whereas Distribution Matching and\nCoverage Maximization did not. The latter two strategies\nachieve nearly comparable performance to a network with\nunlimited experience replay capacity.

Image quality assessment:\nfrom error", " INTRODUCTION\nDeep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) has been shown\nto be an effective framework for solving a rich reper-\ntoire of complex control problems. In simulated domains,\nagents have been developed to perform a diverse array of\nchallenging tasks [1], [2], [3]. Unfortunately, many of the\ncapabilities demonstrated by simulated agents have often\nnot been realized by their physical counterparts. Many of\nthe modern DeepRL algorithms, which have spurred recent\nbreakthroughs, pose high sample complexities, therefore\noften precluding their direct application to physical systems.\nIn addition to sample complexity, deploying RL algorithms\nin the real world also raises a number of safety concerns\nboth for the agent and its surroundings. Since exploration\nis a key component of the learning process, an agent can at\ntimes perform actions that endanger itself or its environment.\nTraining agents in simulation is a promising approach that\ncircumvents some of these obstacles. However, transferring\npolicies from simulation to the real world entails challenges\nin bridging the \u201dreality gap\u201d, the mismatch between the\nsimulated and real world environments. Narrowing this gap\nhas been a subject of intense interest in robotics, as it offers\nthe potential of applying powerful algorithms that have so\nfar been relegated to simulated domains.\nWhile signi\ufb01cant efforts have been devoted to building\nhigher \ufb01delity simulators, we show that dynamics random-\nization using low \ufb01delity simulations can also be an effective\n1OpenAI\n2UC Berkeley, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer\nScience\nFig. 1.

The effectiveness of our approach is\ndemonstrated on an object pushing task, where a policy\ntrained exclusively in simulation is able to successfully\nperform the task with a real robot without additional training\non the physical system.\nII. RELATED WORK\nRecent years have seen the application of deep reinforce-\nment learning to a growing repertoire of control problems.\nThe framework has enabled simulated agents to develop\nhighly dynamic motor skills [4], [5], [6], [7]. But due to\nthe high sample complexity of RL algorithms and other\nphysical limitations, many of the capabilities demonstrated\nin simulation have yet to be replicated in the physical world.\nGuided Policy Search (GPS) [8] represents one of the few\nalgorithms capable of training policies directly on a real\nrobot. By leveraging trajectory optimization with learned lin-\near dynamics models, the method is able to develop complex\nmanipulation skills with relatively few interactions with the\nenvironment. The method has also been extended to learning\nvision-based manipulation policies [9]. Researchers have also\nexplored parallelizing training across multiple robots [10].\nNonetheless, successful examples of training policies directly\non physical robots have so far been demonstrated only on\nrelatively restrictive domains.\nA. Domain Adaptation\nThe problem of transferring control policies from sim-\nulation to the real world can be viewed as an instance\nof domain adaptation, where a model trained in a source\ndomain is transfered to a new target domain.

This problem can e\ufb03ciently be\napproximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation\nto the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.\nThe theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,\nsolving the unconstrained optimization problem\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]/bracketrightbigg\n(5)\nfor some coe\ufb03cient \u03b2. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes\nthe max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the\nperformance of the policy \u03c0.

Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2\nimplemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do\none million timesteps of training on each one.

Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction", " INTRODUCTION\nPerforming robotic learning in a physics simulator could\naccelerate the impact of machine learning on robotics by\nallowing faster, more scalable, and lower-cost data collection\nthan is possible with physical robots. Learning in simula-\ntion is especially promising for building on recent results\nin computer vision use realistic textures, but do not create\ncoherent 3D scenes. Instead, objects are rendered against a\nsolid methods. See [13] for a more complete treatment of\ndomain adaptation in the reinforcement learning literature.\nIn this paper we study the possibility of transfer from\nsimulation to the real world without performing domain\nadaptation.\nC. Bridging the reality gap\nPrevious work on leveraging simulated data for physical\nrobotic RELATED WORK\nA. Object detection and pose estimation for robotics\nObject detection and pose estimation for robotics is a well-\nstudied problem in the literature (see, e.g., [4], [5], [6], [10],\n[44], [50], [54]). Recent approaches typically involve of\ufb02ine\nconstruction or learning of a 3D model of objects in the\nscene (e.g., a full 3D mesh model [44] or a 3D metric feature\nrepresentation [5]). At test time, features from the test data\n(e.g., Scale-Invariant Feature Transform [SIFT] features [12]\nor color co-occurrence histograms [10]) are matched with the\n3D models (or features from the 3D models). For example,\na black-box nonlinear optimization algorithm can be used\nto minimize the re-projection error of the SIFT points from\nthe object model and the 2D points in the test image [4].\nMost successful approaches rely on using multiple camera\nframes [6] or depth information [44]. There has also been\nsome success with only monocular camera images [4].\nCompared to our method, traditional approaches require\nless extensive training and take advantage of richer sensory\ndata, allowing them to detect the full 3D pose of objects\n(position and orientation) without any assumptions about\nthe location or size of the surface on which the objects\nare placed. However, our approach avoids the challenging\nproblem of 3D reconstruction, and employs a simple, easy\nto implement deep learning-based pipeline that may scale\nbetter to more challenging problems.\nB. Domain adaptation\nThe computer vision community has devoted signi\ufb01cant\nstudy to the problem of adapting vision-based models trained\nin a source domain to a previously unseen target domain\n(see, e.g., [9], [14], [15], [19], [23], [25], [51]). A varietyof approaches have been proposed, including re-training the\nmodel in the target domain (e.g., [52]), adapting the weights\nof the model based on the statistics of the source and target\ndomains (e.g., [22]), learning invariant features between\ndomains (e.g., [47]), and learning a mapping from the target\ndomain to the source domain (e.g., [43]). Researchers in\nthe reinforcement learning community have also studied the\nproblem of domain adaptation by learning invariant feature\nrepresentations [13], adapting pretrained networks [35], and\nother background are unnecessary, despite some clutter (e.g.,\ncables) on the \ufb02oor in our real images.\nOur method avoids calibration and precise placement of\nthe camera in the real world by randomizing characteristics\nof the cameras used to render images in training. We manu-\nally place a camera in the simulated scene that approximately\nmatches the viewpoint and \ufb01eld of view of the real camera.\nEach training sample places the camera randomly within a\n(10\u00025\u000210)cm box around this initial point. The viewing\nangle of the camera is calculated analytically to point at a\n\ufb01xed point on the table, and then offset by up to 0:1radians\nin each direction. The \ufb01eld of view is also scaled", "Abstract \u2014 Reinforcement learning (RL) can automate a wide\nvariety of robotic skills, but learning each new skill requires\nconsiderable real-world data collection and manual representa-\ntion engineering to design policy classes or features.

Background and problem formulation\nAs usual, we assume that the interaction between agent and environment can be modeled as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP, Puterman, [ 19]).

The dominance of DBN-based approaches has been recently overturned by a\nresurgence of interest in recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches. An RNN is a special\ntype of neural network that is able to handle both variable-length input and output. By training an\nRNN to predict the next output in a sequence, given all previous outputs, it can be used to model\njoint probability distribution over sequences.\nBoth RNNs and DBNs consist of two parts: (1) a transition function that determines the evolution\nof the internal hidden state, and (2) a mapping from the state to the output. There are, however, a\nfew important differences between RNNs and DBNs.\nDBNs have typically been limited either to relatively simple state transition structures (e.g., linear\nmodels in the case of the Kalman \ufb01lter) or to relatively simple internal state structure (e.g., the HMM\nstate space consists of a single set of mutually exclusive states). RNNs, on the other hand, typically\npossess both a richly distributed internal state representation and \ufb02exible non-linear transition func-\ntions. These differences give RNNs extra expressive power in comparison to DBNs. This expressive\npower and the ability to train via error backpropagation are the key reasons why RNNs have gained\npopularity as generative models for highly structured sequential data.\nIn this paper, we focus on another important difference between DBNs and RNNs. While the hidden\nstate in DBNs is expressed in terms of random variables, the internal transition structure of the\nstandard RNN is entirely deterministic. The only source of randomness or variability in the RNN\nis found in the conditional output probability model. We suggest that this can be an inappropriate\nway to model the kind of variability observed in highly structured data, such as natural speech,\nwhich is characterized by strong and complex dependencies among the output variables at different\n1Code is available at http://www.github.com/jych/nips2015_vrnn\n1arXiv:1506.02216v6  [cs.LG]  6 Apr 2016timesteps. We argue, as have others [4, 2], that these complex dependencies cannot be modelled\nef\ufb01ciently by the output probability models used in standard RNNs, which include either a simple\nunimodal distribution or a mixture of unimodal distributions.\nWe propose the use of high-level latent random variables to model the variability observed in the\ndata. In the context of standard neural network models for non-sequential data, the variational au-\ntoencoder (V AE) [11, 17] offers an interesting combination of highly \ufb02exible non-linear mapping\nbetween the latent random state and the observed output and effective approximate inference. In this\npaper, we propose to extend the V AE into a recurrent framework for modelling high-dimensional\nsequences. The V AE can model complex multimodal distributions, which will help when the un-\nderlying true data distribution consists of multimodal conditional distributions. We call this model\navariational RNN (VRNN).\nA natural question to ask is: how do we encode observed variability via latent random variables?\nThe answer to this question depends on the nature of the data itself. In this work, we are mainly\ninterested in highly structured data that often arises in AI applications. By highly structured, we\nmean that the data is characterized by two properties.

By enhancing the performance of these algorithms, we can enable more sophisticated applications, such as real-time decision-making in complex environments, which could lead to breakthroughs in automation, AI-driven robotics, and interactive gaming. This research could also inspire future studies on algorithmic efficiency and adaptability, fostering a deeper understanding of learning dynamics in AI systems.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in improving deep reinforcement learning algorithms stem from the high dimensionality and continuous nature of the control tasks, which complicate the learning process. Naive approaches may fail due to issues like sample inefficiency, where the algorithms require an impractically large amount of data to learn effectively. Additionally, the exploration-exploitation trade-off poses a significant obstacle, as agents must balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known rewarding actions. Technical complexities, such as the need for robust function approximation and the integration of memory mechanisms, further complicate the development of effective solutions.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on discrete action spaces or has not adequately addressed the intricacies of continuous control tasks. Limitations in computational resources and the lack of sophisticated algorithms capable of handling the continuous nature of these tasks have hindered progress. Additionally, existing solutions may not have effectively integrated advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms or memory-augmented architectures, which are essential for improving performance in complex environments. Our approach aims to leverage these advanced methodologies to fill the gaps left by prior work, providing a more comprehensive solution to the problem.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel architecture that combines deep reinforcement learning with attention mechanisms and memory-augmented components. We will utilize benchmark datasets from continuous control tasks, such as those provided by the dm_control suite, to evaluate our approach. The performance will be measured using metrics such as cumulative reward and learning efficiency. We expect our results to demonstrate significant improvements in both the speed of learning and the overall performance of agents in continuous control tasks, thereby validating the effectiveness of our proposed enhancements.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can we develop a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that effectively integrates adaptive probabilistic state-space models with learning-based model predictive control to enhance real-time uncertainty quantification and safe exploration in dynamic environments?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem has profound implications for the research community, particularly in the fields of reinforcement learning and autonomous systems. Current approaches often struggle with uncertainty in dynamic environments, leading to suboptimal decision-making in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and healthcare. By developing a robust framework that combines probabilistic modeling with model predictive control, we can enhance the ability of automated systems to adapt to changing conditions while ensuring safety. This research could advance knowledge by providing new insights into the interplay between exploration and safety in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, it could lead to practical applications where safe and efficient decision-making is paramount, thereby influencing future research directions in AI safety and autonomous decision-making.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges involved in solving this problem are multifaceted. First, integrating adaptive probabilistic state-space models with learning-based model predictive control requires a sophisticated understanding of both probabilistic reasoning and control theory, which can be complex and mathematically intensive. Naive approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of state spaces and the non-linear dynamics often present in real-world environments, making it difficult to accurately model uncertainties. Additionally, the dynamic tuning of exploration strategies and safety parameters introduces significant technical hurdles, as it necessitates real-time adjustments based on limited data and changing conditions. Finally, ensuring robustness in decision-making under uncertainty is a critical obstacle that must be overcome to achieve reliable outcomes.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has largely focused on either reinforcement learning or model predictive control in isolation, which limits the ability to address problems involving uncertainty in dynamic environments comprehensively. Existing solutions often rely on fixed exploration strategies or predefined safety constraints, which can hinder adaptability and lead to inefficient decision-making. Moreover, many studies do not leverage advanced probabilistic modeling techniques, resulting in a lack of frameworks that can dynamically adjust to new information. My approach differs by proposing a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both probabilistic modeling and learning-based control, thus filling the gaps left by prior works and enabling a more adaptable and robust solution to the problem of uncertainty in automated decision-making.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that integrates adaptive probabilistic state-space models with learning-based model predictive control. The framework will utilize Bayesian optimization techniques to dynamically tune exploration strategies and safety parameters, ensuring effective adaptation to changing environments. The dataset will consist of simulated environments with varying degrees of uncertainty, allowing for comprehensive testing of the framework's performance. The primary metric for evaluation will be the balance between exploration efficiency and safety compliance, measured through reward functions and constraint violation rates. Expected outcomes include improved resilience and efficiency in automated decision-making systems, with empirical results demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional approaches in safety-critical applications.

KalMamba then uses\ntime-parallel Kalman filtering [ 42] to infer filtered beliefs q(zt|o\u2264t,a\u2264t\u22121)which can be used for\ncontrol with a Soft Actor Critic (SAC) [21]. For model training, KalMamba employs an additional\ntime-parallel Kalman smoothing step to obtain smoothed beliefs q(zt|o\u2264T,a\u2264T). These beliefs\nallow training a model that excels in modeling uncertainties due to a tight variational lower bound [ 5].\nCrucially, the smoothing step does not introduce trainable model parameters, enabling the direct use\nof the filtered beliefs for downstream RL policy training and execution.\nthe benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for\nlong-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency\nof recent deterministic SSMs. Our approach, KalMamba , uses (extended) Kalman filtering and\nsmoothing [ 28,40,27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a\ndynamics model based on Mamba [15]. In this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-\npurpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model. The Kalman\nSmoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states. Figure 1 provides a\nschematic overview.

As a reminder, S3M comprises three main\ncomponents: the deterministic output state ht, leveraged by pre-\ndiction heads to summarize information from previous steps;\nthe stochastic state zt, representing each single observation;\nand the hidden state xt, which is passed between time steps.\nThe policy variants are the output state policy \u03c0(\u02c6at|zt, ht),\nthe hidden state policy \u03c0(\u02c6at|zt, xt), and the full state policy\n\u03c0(\u02c6at|zt, ht, xt).\nOur main insight is that in different environments ht,zt, andxt\nbehave differently and they may represent different information.\nAdditionally, the evolution of their distributions during world model training hurts the actor-critic\ntraining stability. Hence, we found each domain has its own working configuration. The only shared\ntrait is that memory-intensive environments generally prefer policies that incorporate xt, either\nthrough \u03c0(\u02c6at|zt, xt)or\u03c0(\u02c6at|zt, ht, xt)\u2013 a finding corroborated by our analyses in Figures 17 and\n18.

In this paper, we assume the latent space Zas a pre-\nspecified Banach space, which is a complete normed vector space. We further assume any latent state\ndistribution defined on Zhas a finite expectation. To avoid a measure-theoretic treatment, we assume\nthat Z is discrete-valued in our proof analysis. The proof arguments are easily generalized to the case\nwhenZlies in a Banach space using standard arguments.\nRemark on the existence of optimal value and policy in POMDPs. In an MDP, it is well-known\nthat there exists a unique optimal value function following the Bellman equation, which induces\nan optimal deterministic policy (Puterman, 1994). In POMDPs, the result is complicated. For a\nfinite-horizon POMDP, one can construct a finite-dimensional state space by stacking all previous\nobservations and actions to convert a POMDP into an MDP, thus the MDP result can be directly\napplied. For an infinite-horizon POMDP, Subramanian et al. (2022, Theorem 25) shows that the unique\noptimal value function exists when the POMDP has a time-invariant finite-dimensional information\nstate, which is the case when the unobserved state space is finite. The POMDP Abstract MDP. Given an encoder \u03d5, we can construct an background in Sec. A.2,", " Introduction\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have emerged\nas an effective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models , operating on\narbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and\ngenomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever,\nVinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are\npredominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention\nlayer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely\nwithin a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks:\nan inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length.\nAn enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay,\nDehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these\nvariants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains.\nRecently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have\nemerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with inspiration from classical state space\nmodels (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with\nlinear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range\ndependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the Long Range\n\u2217Alphabetical by first name.\n1arXiv:2312.00752v2  [cs.LG]  31 May 2024Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu,\nand Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been\nsuccessful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022;\nSaon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such\nas text.\nWe propose a new class of selective state space models , that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the\nmodeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length.\nSelection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an\ninput-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic\ntasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM\nparameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information\nindefinitely.\nHardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical", " Introduction\nWorld models attempt to learn a compact and expressive representation of the environment dynamics\nfrom observed data. These models can predict possible future world states as a function of an\nimagined action sequence and are a key ingredient of model-predictive control [ 4] and model-based\nreinforcement learning (RL). One important dimension of world models is the level of temporal\ngranularity or the time scale at which the model operates. Existing literature on world models operates\nat a single level of temporal abstraction, typically at a fine-grained level such as milliseconds. One\ndrawback of single-time scale world models is that they may not capture longer-term trends and\npatterns in the data [18].\nFor efficient long-horizon prediction and planning, the model needs to predict at multiple levels of\ntemporal abstractions [ 29,23]. Intuitively, low-level temporal abstractions should contain precise\ndetails about the input so as to predict accurately in the short term, while high-level, abstract action is an inferred latent variable with an associated uncertainty estimate.\nHence we use a linear control model Y, for principled uncertainty propagation.\nA.3.2 Transition Noise\nWe assume the covariance of the transition noise QandSin both timescales to be diagonal. The\nnoise is learned and is independent of the latent state.\nA.4 Training\nA.4.1 Training Objective Derivation\nWe further expand on the training objective in Section 4.2 here. The training objective for the MTS3\ninvolves maximizing the posterior predictive log-likelihood which for a single trajectory, can be\nderived as,\nL=NX\nk=1HX\nt=1logp(ok,t+1|\u03b21:k\u22121,\u03b11:k\u22121,wk,1:t,ak,1:t)\n=NX\nk=1HX\nt=1logZZ\np(ok,t+1|zk,t+1)p(zk,t+1|wk,1:t,ak,1:t,lk)p(lk|\u03b21:k\u22121,\u03b11:k\u22121)dzk,t+1dlk\n=NX\nk=1HX\nt=1logZ\np(ok,t+1|zk,t+1)plk(zk,t+1|wk,1:t,ak,1:t)dzk,t+1. (15)\nThe extension to multiple trajectories is straightforward. The approximation to the objective is done\nbased on a moment-matching perspective as discussed in Section 4.2 of the main paper.\nA.4.2 Initialization\nWe initialize the states l1andz1,1at both timescales for the first-time window k= 1with an all zeros\nvector and corresponding covariance matrices as \u03a3l1=\u03a3z1,1= 10\u00b7I. For subsequent windows, the\nprior belief p(zk,1)for the first time step of time window k, is initialized using the posterior belief\nplk\u22121(zk\u22121,H|wk\u22121,1:H,ak\u22121,1:H)of the last time step of time window k\u22121.\nIt is also crucial to correctly initialize the transition matrix at both time scales so that the transition\ndoes not yield an unstable system. Initially, the transition model should focus on copying the encoder\noutput so that the encoder can learn how to extract good features if observations are available and\nuseful. We initialize the diagonal elements of the transition matrix at both timescales with 1 and the\noff-diagonal elements with 0.2, while the rest of the elements are set to 0, a choice inspired from [ 1].\nA.4.3 Learnable Parameters\nThe learnable parameters in the computation graph are as follows:\nFast Time Scale SSM: The linear transition model A, the non-linear control factor b, the linear\nlatent task transformation model C, the transition noise Q, along with the observation encoder and\nthe output decoder.\nSlow Time Scale SSM: The linear transition model X, the linear control model Y , the transition\nnoise S, along with the observation set encoder and the action set encoder.\n17B Proofs and Derivations\nri \u2113\nN\nFigure 8: Graphical Model\nFor Bayesian conditioning\nwithNobservations.In the following sections vectors are denoted by a lowercase letter in\nbold, such as \" v\", while Matrices as an uppercase letter in bold, such\nas \"M\".Idenotes identity matrix and 0represents a matrix filled\nwith zeros.

Temporal Difference methods like SAC, especially\nsince the optimal policy must issue large actions to observe the reward. Meanwhile, the\nquantile-based optimistic approaches performed best. In this experiment, we test the same\nsetting in two tasks with sparse rewards from the DeepMind Control suite, where we add an\naction cost proportional to the squared norm of the action taken by the agent. Namely,\naction_cost =\u03c1|A|X\ni=1a2\ni (54)\nwhere \u03c1is an environment specific base multiplier, aiis the i-th component of the action\nvector and |A|is the size of the action space. For cartpole-swingup we use \u03c1= 0.001\nand for pendulum we use \u03c1= 0.01. The resuls in Figure 19 show a similar degradation of\nperformance for SAC. Unlike the MountainCar Related work\nDistributional RL. The treatment of the policy return as a random variable dates back\nto Sobel (1982), where it is shown that the higher moments of the return obeys a Bellman\nequation. More recently, distributional RL has emerged as a paradigm for modelling and\nutilizing the entire distribution of returns (Tamar et al., 2013; Bellemare et al., 2023), with\nreal-world applications including guidance of stratospheric balloons (Bellemare et al., 2020)\nand super-human race-driving in simulation (Wurman et al., 2022). The distributional RL\ntoolbox has expanded over the years with diverse distribution representations (Bellemare\net al., 2017; Dabney et al., 2018b,a; Yang et al., 2019) and deeper theoretical understanding\n(Bellemare et al., 2019; Rowland et al., 2018; Lyle et al., 2019). In our core algorithm, we\nuse quantile-regression (QR) by Dabney et al. (2018b) as a tool for learning the value, rather\nthan return, distribution. Moreover, QR has been integrated with soft actor-critic (SAC)\n(Haarnoja et al., 2018) for improved performance (Wurman et al., 2022; Kuznetsov et al.,\n2020). At a high level, this paper combines model learning with quantile-regression, which is\nthen integrated with SAC for policy optimization.\n2Value-Distributional MBRL\nBayesian RL. Model-free approaches to Bayesian RL directly model the distribution\nover values, e.g., with normal-gamma priors (Dearden et al., 1998), Gaussian Processes (Engel\net al., 2003) or ensembles of neural networks (Osband et al., 2016). Instead, model-based\nBayesian RL represents uncertainty in the MDP dynamics, which must then be propagated\nto the value function. For instance, the PILCO algorithm by Deisenroth and Rasmussen\n(2011) learns a Gaussian Process model of the transition dynamics and integrates over\nthe model\u2019s total uncertainty to obtain the expected values. In order to scale to high-\ndimensional continuous-control problems, Chua et al. (2018) use ensembles of probabilistic\nneural networks (NNs) to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, as first proposed\nby Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017). Both approaches propagate model uncertainty during\npolicy evaluation and improve the policy via greedy exploitation over this model-generated\nnoise.\nClosest to our problem setting are approaches that explicitly model the value distribution\nfunction or statistics thereof. The uncertainty Bellman equation (UBE) offers a framework\nto estimate the variance of the value distribution (O\u2019Donoghue et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020;\nLuis et al., 2023). Jorge et al. (2020) propose a principled backwards induction framework\nto estimate value distributions, with the caveat of assuming a Gaussian parameterization\nfor practical implementation. Perhaps closest to our approach is the work by Dearden\net al. (1999), which introduces a local sampling scheme that maintains", " Introduction\nIn recent years, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019) have achieved remarkable\nsuccess in domains ranging from language modeling to computer vision. Within the RL community,\nthere has been excitement around the idea that large models with attention architectures, such as\nTransformers, might enable rapid progress on challenging RL tasks. Indeed, prior works have shown\nthat Transformer-based Appendix C.\n5.1 Transformers Shine in Pure Long-Term Memory Tasks\nFirst, we provide evidence that Transformers can indeed enhance long-term memory in tasks that\npurely test memory, Passive T-Mazes. In Fig. 3 (left), Transformer-based agents consistently solve the\ntask requiring memory lengths from 50up to 1500 .

Left: abstract problems,\nusing our notion. Assume all tasks have a horizon of T. Related Work\nMemory and credit assignment have been extensively studied in RL, with representative works\nshown in Table 1. The work most closely related to ours is bsuite (Osband et al., 2020), which\n6Figure 2: Pixel-based tasks, Passive Visual Match (left) and Key-to-Door (right), evaluated\nin our experiments (Sec. 5.3) are relatively cheap to compute. Each experiment run was carried out on a\nsingle A100 GPU and a single CPU core. For Transformer-based RL, the GPU memory usage is\napproximately proportional to the square of the context lengths, with a maximum usage of 4GB for\nPassive T-Maze with a context length of 1500 . For LSTM-based RL, GPU memory usage is roughly\nlinearly proportional.\nIn our tasks, the context length equals the episode length (and also memory length), thus the total\ntraining time is proportional to num_episodes * context_length**2 * update_frequency\nfor both Transformers and LSTMs. The update_frequency , set as 0.25, is the ratio of parameter\nupdate w.r.t. environment step. Additionally, for multi-layer Transformers, the training time is roughly\nlinear to the number of layers. Table 6 summarizes the training hyperparameters.\nIn Passive T-Maze with a memory length of 1500 , it took around 6 and 4 days to train Transformer-\nbased and LSTM-based RL, respectively. In Passive Visual Match with a memory length of 1000 , it\ntook around 5 days for both Transformer-based and LSTM-based RL.\nD Broader Impacts\nOur work enhances understanding of long-term memory capability in Transformer-based RL. This\nimproved memory capability, while offering advancements in RL, may pose privacy concerns if\nmisused, potentially enabling systems to retain and misuse sensitive information. As this technology\ndevelops, strict data privacy measures are essential. However, negative impacts directly tied to our\nfoundational research are speculative, as we propose no specific application of this technology.\n24 Results\nFig. 11 shows the learning curves of training Transformers with varying numbers of layers and heads.\nSimilar to the scaling Conclusion\nIn this study, we evaluate the memory and credit assignment capabilities of memory-based RL agents,\nwith a focus on Transformer-based RL. While Transformer-based agents excel in tasks requiring\nlong-term memory, they do not improve long-term credit assignment and generally have poor sample\nefficiency. Furthermore, we highlighted that many existing RL tasks, even those designed to evaluate\n(long-term) memory or credit assignment, often intermingle both capabilities or require only short-\nterm dependencies. While", " Introduction\nStructured state space sequence (S4) models [ 12] and their variants such as S5 [ 38] have recently\nachieved impressive Background\n2.1 Structured State Space Sequence Models\nState Space Models (SSMs) have been widely used to model various phenomenon using first-order\ndifferential equations [ 14]. At each timestep t, these models take an input signal u(t). This is used\nto update a latent state x(t)which in turn computes the signal y(t). Some of the more widely-used\n2canonical SSMs are continuous-time linear SSMs, which are defined by the following equations:\n\u02d9x(t) =Ax(t) +Bu(t) (1)\ny(t) =Cx(t) +Du(t)\nwhere A,B,C,andDare matrices of appropriate sizes. To model sequences with a fixed step size\n\u2206, one can discretise the SSM using various techniques, such as the zero-order hold method, to obtain\na simple linear recurrence:\nxn=\u00afAxn\u22121+\u00afBun (2)\nyn=\u00afCxn+\u00afDun\nwhere \u00afA,\u00afB,\u00afC,and\u00afDcan be calculated as functions of A,B,C,D,and\u2206.\nS4 [12] proposed the use of SSMs for modelling long sequences and various techniques to improve\nits stability, performance, and training speeds when combined with deep learning. For example, S4\nmodels use a special matrix initialisation to better preserve sequence history called HiPPO [11].\nOne of the primary strengths of the S4 model is that it can be converted to both a recurrent model,\nwhich allows for fast and memory-efficient inference-time computation, and a convolutional model,\nwhich allows for efficient training that is parallelisable across timesteps [13].\nMore recently, Smith et al. [38] proposed multiple simplifications to S4, called S5. One of its contribu-\ntions is the use of parallel scans instead of convolution, which vastly simplifies S4\u2019s complexity and\nenables more flexible modifications. Parallel scans take advantage of the fact that the composition of\nassociative operations can be computed in any order. Recall that for an operation \u2022to be associative,\nit must satisfy (x\u2022y)\u2022z=x\u2022(y\u2022z).\nGiven an associative binary operator \u2022and a sequence of length N, parallel scan returns:\n[e1, e1\u2022e2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, e1\u2022e2\u2022 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2022 eN] (3)\nFor example, when \u2022is addition, the parallel scan calculates the prefix-sum, which returns the running\ntotal of an input sequence.

To understand the gap between SSMs and attention, we draw\non synthetic language modeling tasks that have been proposed as a mechanistic basis for in-context learning\nin Transformers [ 49] These synthetic languages focus on the ability to manipulate text|recalling tokens\nfrom earlier time steps, or comparing tokens from di\u000berent points in a sequence. We \fnd that existing SSMs\nstruggle to model these synthetic languages. To probe how important these skills are for language modeling,\nwe propose H3(Hungry Hungry Hippo), a new SSM-based layer designed to solve these language modeling\ntasks. H3stacks two SSMs, with multiplicative interactions between their outputs and input projections.\nThe SSMs allow H3to keep a log of tokens (to recall them later), while the multiplicative interactions allow\nfor comparisons across the sequence.\nH3matches attention on the synthetic languages and almost closes the gap with Transformers on language\nmodeling|coming within 0.4 perplexity of Transformers on OpenWebText (compared to 3.4 ppl for existing\nSSMs|even those explicitly designed for language modeling [ 42]). Furthermore, a simple hybrid H3-attention\nmodel that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0\nperplexity. To further evaluate H3on language modeling, we train 125M-, 355M-, 1.3B-, and 2.7B-parameter\nhybrid H3-attention language models on the Pile [ 21], using hyperparameters from GPT-3 [ 7]. These\nhybrid models outperform Transformer-based language models of the same size in perplexity, and match or\noutperform them on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark in zero- and few-shot learning. Since\nthe SSM layers in these hybrid models admit a recurrent view, they can also perform 2.4 \u0002faster inference\nthan Transformers.\nScaling SSMs. Next, we improve", " Introduction\nAccurate system models are crucial for model-based control and reinforcement learning (RL) in au-\ntonomous systems applications under partial observability. Practitioners commonly use state space models\n(SSMs) (Murphy, 2012) to formalize such systems. SSMs consist of a dynamics model, describing how one\nstate relates to the next, and an observation model, which describes how system states generate observations.\nYet, dynamics and observation models are unknown for most relevant problems, and exact inference in the\nresulting SSM is usually intractable. Researchers have proposed numerous approaches to learn the models\nfrom data and approximate the inference to solve those issues.\nRecurrent State Space Models (RSSMs) (Hafner et al., 2019) are of particular interest here. Using RSSMs\nas the backbone for their Deep Planning Network (PlaNet) , Hafner et al. (2019) showed that variational\nlatent dynamics learning can succeed in image-based RL for complex control tasks. Combined with simple\n1Code available at: https://github.com/pbecker93/vrkn\n1arXiv:2210.09256v1  [cs.LG]  17 Oct 2022Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2022)\nplanning, RSSMscan match the performance of model-free RL while requiring signi\ufb01cantly fewer environ-\nment interactions. The authors later improved upon their original model, including a parametric policy\ntrained on imagined trajectories ( Dreamer ) (Hafner et al., 2020). In general, approaches based on RSSMs\nhave found considerable interest in the model-based RL community. Yet, while RSSMs draw inspiration\nfrom classical SSMs, they use a simpli\ufb01ed inference scheme. During inference, they assume the belief is\nindependent of future observations instead of using the correct smoothing assumptions (Murphy, 2012) to\nobtain the belief. We formalize this observation in Section 2 and discuss how these simpli\ufb01ed assumptions\nresult in a theoretically looser variational lower bound. Further, we analyze the e\ufb00ects of these assumptions\non model learning and \ufb01nd they cause an overestimation of aleatoric uncertainty. Such aleatoric uncertainty\nstems from partial observability or inherent stochasticity of the system (H\u00fcllermeier & Waegeman, 2021).\nIt plays an important role in many realistic tasks, e.g., in the form of occlusions, missing observations, or\nobservations arriving in di\ufb00erent modalities and frequencies. Consider, for example, low-frequency camera\nimages providing external information and high-frequency proprioceptive measurements of the robot\u2019s inter-\nnal state. Given such sensory inputs, we require an appropriate estimation of aleatoric uncertainty to fuse\nall information optimally and form accurate belief states. Our results are displayed in Figure 37 and show that neither an increased state size nor Bayesian treatment\nyields signi\ufb01cant performance improvements.\n30Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2022)\nVRKN (no MCD) VRKN RSSM\nCheetah Run 705.1629\u00b17.3881 749 .2355\u00b15.3298 627 .4290\u00b17.4144\nWalker Walk 889.8291\u00b114.2379 940.5245\u00b111.0899 945 .8944\u00b12.1465\nCartpole Swingup 625.0746\u00b122.7305 779 .3265\u00b17.7148 790 .4359\u00b18.4232\nCup Catch 548.4413\u00b135.6197 652.2427\u00b137.5175 783.3987\u00b154.1554\nReacher Easy 871.8760\u00b110.4746 872 .0493\u00b19.5175 862 .8973\u00b18.1286\nFinger Spin 564.7493\u00b131.3898 578.9867\u00b131.7433 623.6027\u00b121.5528\nTable 4: Mean and standard-error of \ufb01nal performance for the comparison of VRKN(with and without\nMonte Carlo Dropout) and RSSMon all tasks considered for the PlaNet-agents.\n02004006008001,000Expected ReturnCheetah Run\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMWalker Walk Cartpole Swingup Cup Catch\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.002004006008001,000\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Expected ReturnReacher Easy\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Hopper Hop\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Pendulum Swingup\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Walker Run\nFigure18: Comparisonof VRKN(withandwithoutMonteCarloDropout)and RSSMonalltasksconsidered\nfor theDreamer -agents.VRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSM01002003004005006007008009001,000Expected ReturnCheetah Run\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMWalker Walk\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMCartpole Swingup\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMCup Catch\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMReacher Easy\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMHopper Hop\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMPendulum Swingup\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMWalker Run\nFigure 19: Box plots", " Introduction\nDesigning a single uni\ufb01ed model to capture long range dependencies in sequential data across\na diverge range of modalities, such as language, audio, image and video, is a central and\nchallenging problem in sequence modeling.

However, these models as-\nsume that the dynamics are fixed and unchanging, which is rarely the case in real-\nworld scenarios. Many control applications often exhibit tasks with similar but not\nidentical dynamics which can be modeled as a latent variable. We introduce the\nHidden Parameter Recurrent State Space Models (HiP-RSSMs), a framework that\nparametrizes a family of related dynamical systems with a low-dimensional set of\nlatent factors. We present a simple and effective way of learning and performing\ninference over this Gaussian graphical model that avoids approximations like vari-\national inference. We show that HiP-RSSMs outperforms RSSMs and competing\nmulti-task models on several challenging robotic benchmarks both on real-world\nsystems and simulations.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nSystem identification, i.e., learning models of dynamical systems from observed data ( Ljung (1998);\nGevers (2005)), is a key ingredient of model-predictive control (Camacho & Alba (2013)) and\nmodel-based reinforcement learning (RL). State space models (Hamilton (1994); Jordan (2004);\nSch\u00a8on et al. (2011)) (SSMs) provide a principled framework for modelling dynamics. Recently\nthere have been several works that fused SSMs with deep (recurrent) neural networks achieving\nsuperiorresults of multi-step ahead predictions for upto 50 steps of HiP-RSSM\nwith recurrent baselines like RKN(Becker et al., 2019) and LSTM. Inorder to train the recurrent\nmodels for multi step ahead predictions, we removed three-quarters of the observations from the\ntemporal sequence and tasked the models with imputing those missing observations, only based on\nthe knowledge of available actions/control commands, i.e., we train the models to perform action\nconditional future predictions to impute missing observations. The imputation employs the model\nfor multi-step ahead predictions in a convenient way (Shaj et al., 2020). One could instead also go\nfor a dedicated multi-step loss function as in approaches like Finn et al. (2016).\nAs seen in figure 5b, HiP-RSSM clearly outperforms contemporary recurrent models for multi-step\nahead prediction tasks since it takes into account additional causal factors of variation (slopes of the\nterrain for this robot) in the latent dynamics in an unsupervised manner.\nD H IP-RSSM DURING TESTTIME/ INFERENCE\nWe perform inference using HiP-RSSM at test time on a trajectory with varying dynamics using\nalgorithm 1.

[8]showed that naive instantiations of the SSM do not perform well, and instead relied on a\nparticular (real-valued) matrix Acalled the HiPPO-LegS matrix (4).1These matrices were derived so that\nthe basis kernels Kn(t) have closed-form formulas Ln(e\u0000t), whereLn(t) are normalized Legendre polynomials.\nConsequently, the SSM has a mathematical interpretation of decomposing the input signal u(t) onto a set of\nin\fnitely-long basis functions that are orthogonal respect to an exponentially-decaying measure, giving it\nlong-range modeling abilities [10].\nSecond, S4 introduced a particular parameterization that decomposed this Amatrix into the sum of a normal\nand rank-1 matrix (5), which can be unitarily conjugated into a (complex) diagonal plus rank-1 matrix.\nLeveraging this structured form, they then introduced a sophisticated algorithm for e\u000eciently computing\nthe convolution kernel (2) for state matrices that are diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR) .\nAnk=\u00008\n><\n>:(2n+ 1)1\n2(2k+ 1)1\n2n>k\nn+ 1 n=k\n0 n<k\nBn= (2n+ 1)1\n2Pn= (n+ 1=2)1\n2\n(HiPPO-LegS matrix used in S4 )(4)A(N)\nnk=\u00008\n><\n>:(n+1\n2)1=2(k+1\n2)1=2n>k\n1\n2n=k\n(n+1\n2)1=2(k+1\n2)1=2n<k\nA=A(N)\u0000PP>;A(D):= eig(A(N))\n(Normal / diagonal plus low-rank form )(5)\nDSS: Diagonal State Spaces S4 was originally motivated by searching for a diagonal state matrix , which\nwould be even", " Introduction\nA wide range of modern arti\ufb01cial intelligence challenges ca n be cast as Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) problems under partial observability , in which agents learn to make a sequence of decisions\ndespitelacking complete information abouttheunderlying state of system. For example, in robotics\nthe agent has to cope with noisy sensors, occlusions, and unk nown dynamics ( Akkaya et al. ,2019),\nwhile in imperfect information games the player makes only l ocal observations ( Vinyals et al. ,2019;\nBrown and Sandholm ,2019). Further applications of partially observable RL include autonomous\ndriving ( Levinson et al. ,2011), resource allocation ( Bower and Gilbert ,2005), medical diagnostic\nsystems ( Hauskrecht and Fraser ,2000), recommendation ( Li et al.,2010), business management\n(De Brito and Van Der Laan ,2009), etc. As such, learning and acting under partial observabi lity\nhas been an important topic in operation research, control, and machine learning.\nBecause of the non-Markovian nature of the observations, le arning and planning in partially\nobservable environments requires an agent to maintain memory and possibly reason about be-\nliefsover the states, all while exploring to collect information about the environment. As such,\npartial observability can signi\ufb01cantly complicate learni ng and planning under uncertainty. While\npractical RL systems have succeeded in a set of partially obs ervable problems including Poker\n(Brown and Sandholm ,2019), Starcraft( Vinyals et al. ,2019)andcertainrobotictasks( Cassandra et al. ,\n\u2217The author emails are {qinghual, alan.chung, chij }@princeton.edu andszepesva@ualberta.ca\n11996), the theoretical understanding of learning to act in parti ally observable systems remains lim-\nited.

A key problem is developing architectures for modeling waveforms with the\nfollowing properties:\n1.Globally coherent generation, which requires modeling unbounded contexts with long-range depen-\ndencies.\n2.Computational e\u000eciency through parallel training, and fast autoregressive and non-autoregressive\ninference.\n3.Sample e\u000eciency through a model with inductive biases well suited to high-rate waveform data.\nAmong the many training methods, we sequentially inspect the samples and reject any that are noise-like.\nWe also remove samples that mostly consist of silences (de\fned as more than half the clip being silence).\nWe carry out this process until we have 30 samples per method.\n\u2022Next, we randomly sample 25 clips from the dataset. Since this evaluation is quite subjective, we\ninclude some gold standard samples. We add 4 clips that consist mostly of noise (and should have\nmusicality and quality MOS <= 2). We include 1 clip that has variable quality but musicality MOS\n<= 2. Any workers who disagree with this assessment have their responses omitted from the \fnal\nevaluation.\n\u2022We construct 30 batches, where each batch consists of 1 sample per method (plus a single sample for the\ndataset), presented in random order to a crowdworker. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk for collecting\nresponses, paying $0 :50 per batch and collecting 20 responses per batch. We use Master quali\fcations\nfor workers, and restrict to workers with a HIT approval rating above 98%. We note that it is likely\nenough to collect 10 responses per batch.\n21Figure 6: (YouTubeMix MOS Interface) Crowdsourcing interface for collecting mean opinion scores\n(MOS) on YouTubeMix.

They are asked to rate each \fle on audio \fdelity and musicality.\nFigure 7: (SC09 MOS Interface) Crowdsourcing interface for collecting mean opinion scores (MOS) on\nSC09.

At the bottom, they provide a single score on the audio\nquality and speaker diversity they perceive for the batch.\n22C.4.2 Mean Opinion Scores for SC09\nNext, we outline the protocol used for collecting MOS scores on SC09. We collect MOS scores on digit\nintelligibility, audio quality and speaker diversity, as well as asking crowdworkers to classify digits following\nDonahue et al. [10]. The instructions and interface used are shown in Figure 7.\n\u2022For each method, we generate 2048 samples of 1s each. For autoregressive models ( SaShiMi , SampleRNN,\nWaveNet), we directly sample from the distribution output by the model at each time step, without\nany modi\fcation. For WaveGAN, we obtained 50000 randomly generated samples from the authors,\nand subsampled 2048 samples randomly from this set.

Real-world time-series data often requires reasoning over tens of thousands of time steps, while few\nsequence models address even thousands of time steps. For instance, Background: State Spaces\nSections 2.1 to 2.4 describe the four properties of SSMs in Fig. 1: the classic continuous-time representation,\naddressing LRDs with the HiPPO framework, the discrete-time recurrent representation, and the parallelizable\nconvolution representation. In particular, Section 2.4 introduces the SSM convolution kernel K, which is the\nfocus of our theoretical contributions in Section 3.\n2.1 State Space Models: A Continuous-time Latent State Model\nThe state space model is de\fned by the simple equation (1). It maps a 1-D input signal u(t) to anN-D\nlatent state x(t) before projecting to a 1-D output signal y(t).\nx0(t) =Ax(t) +Bu(t)\ny(t) =Cx(t) +Du(t)(1)\nSSMs are broadly used in many scienti\fc disciplines and related to latent state models such as Hidden Markov\nModels (HMM). Our goal is to simply use the SSM as a black-box representation in a deep sequence model,\nwhere A;B;C;Dare parameters learned by gradient descent. For the remainder of this paper, we will omit\nthe parameter Dfor exposition (or equivalently, assume D= 0) because the term Ducan be viewed as a\nskip connection and is easy to compute.\n2.2 Addressing Long-Range Dependencies with HiPPO\nPrior work found that the basic SSM (1)actually performs very poorly in practice. Intuitively, one explanation\nis that linear \frst-order ODEs solve to an exponential function, and thus may su\u000ber from gradients scaling\nexponentially in the sequence length (i.e., the vanishing/exploding gradients problem [ 32]). To address this\n3problem, the LSSL leveraged the HiPPO theory of continuous-time memorization [ 16]. HiPPO speci\fes a\nclass of certain matrices A2 RN\u0002Nthat when incorporated into (1), allows the state x(t) to memorize the\nhistory of the input u(t). The most important matrix in this class is de\fned by equation (2), which we will\ncall the HiPPO matrix. For example, the LSSL found that simply modifying an SSM from a random matrix\nAto equation (2) improved its performance on the sequential MNIST benchmark from 60% to 98%.\n(HiPPO Matrix )Ank=\u00008\n><\n>:(2n+ 1)1=2(2k+ 1)1=2ifn>k\nn+ 1 if n=k\n0 if n<k: (2)\n2.3 Discrete-time SSM: The Recurrent Representation\nTo be applied on a discrete input sequence ( u0;u1;:::) instead of continuous function u(t),(1)must be\ndiscretized by a step size \u0001 that represents the resolution of the input. Conceptually, the inputs ukcan be\nviewed as sampling an implicit underlying continuous signal u(t), whereuk=u(k\u0001).\nTo discretize the continuous-time SSM, we follow prior work in using the bilinear method [ 43], which converts\nthe state matrix Ainto an approximation A. The discrete SSM is\nxk=Axk\u00001+BukA= (I\u0000\u0001=2\u0001A)\u00001(I+ \u0001=2\u0001A)\nyk=Cxk B= (I\u0000\u0001=2\u0001A)\u00001\u0001B C=C:(3)\nEquation (3)is now a sequence-to-sequence mapuk7!ykinstead of function-to-function. Moreover the state\nequation is now a recurrence in xk, allowing the discrete SSM to be computed like an RNN. Concretely,\nxk2 RNcan be viewed as a hidden state with transition matrix A.\nNotationally, throughout this paper we use A;B;:::to denote discretized SSM matrices de\fned by (3).\nNote that these matrices are a function of both Aas well as a step size \u0001; we suppress this dependence for\nnotational convenience when it is clear.\n2.4 Training SSMs: The Convolutional Representation\nThe recurrent SSM (3)is not practical for training on modern", " Introduction\nReinforcement learning (RL) is typically cast as a problem\nof learning a single fully observable task (an MDP), training\nand testing on that same task.

In Advances", " Introduction\nDynamics models are an integral part of many control architectures. Depending on the control\napproach, the control law relies either on a forward model, mapping from control input to the change\nof system state, or on an inverse model, mapping from the change of the system state to control\nsignals. However, analytical dynamics models are either not available or often too inaccurate in\nsituations such as robots driven by hydraulics, arti\ufb01cial muscles, or robots dealing with unknown\ncontact situations. Hence, there is a signi\ufb01cant need for data-driven approaches that can deal with\nsuch complex systems. Yet, modelling dynamics is a challenging task due to the inherent hysteresis\neffects, unmodelled friction and stiction phenomena, and unknown properties of the interacting\nobjects. Additional challenges for modelling are given by the high data frequency, often up to\n1kHz. Furthermore, many modern model-based architectures [1][2] for learning controllers rely on\nuncertainty estimates of the prediction. Hence, such probabilistic modelling ability is another point\non the desiderata for model learning algorithms.\nCorrespondence to Vaisakh Shaj <v.shaj@kit.edu >\n4th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2020), Cambridge MA, USA.arXiv:2010.10201v2  [cs.RO]  5 Nov 2020In this paper, we extend a recent recurrent neural network architecture [3], called Recurrent Kalman\nNetworks (RKN), for learning forward and inverse dynamics models. The RKN provides probabilis-\ntic predictions of future states, can deal with noisy, high dimensional and missing inputs, and has\nbeen shown to outperform Long-Short Term-Memory Networks (LSTMs)[4] and Gated Recurrent\nUnits (GRUs) [5] on many state estimation tasks. The authors [3] focussed on estimating the state\nof the system from images. We adapt the RKN architecture for prediction instead of \ufb01ltering and\nemploy it for learning robot forward and inverse dynamics. In this scenario, the observations are\ntypically low dimensional, i.e., positions and velocities of the joints of the robot, but occur with a\nmuch higher frequency. Unlike original RKN, we explicitly model the control actions in our archi-\ntecture. We modify the model of the latent transition dynamics using an action dependent non-linear\nadditive factor in order to condition them with action variables. We call this architecture action-\nconditional RKN (ac-RKN) and show that our approach is more accurate than competing learning methods. This highly precise\nmodelling is often a requirement for high \ufb01delity and compliant robotic control.\n7RBD FFNN LSTM ac_RKN101\n4\u00d7102\n6\u00d7102\n2\u00d7101\n3\u00d7101\nRMSE(a) Franka Panda\nFFNN LSTM ac_RKN101\n100 (b) Barret WAM\nPanda Barrett WAM0.040.060.080.100.12No Feedback\nAction Feedback (c) Action Feedback\nFigure 6: (a)and(b)Joint torque prediction RMSE values in NM of Action-Conditional RKN,\nLSTM and FFNN for Panda and Barret WAM.

As seen in the", " Introduction\nModeling and learning from sequential data is a fundamental problem in modern machine learning, underlying\ntasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, video processing, and reinforcement learning. A core\naspect of modeling long-term and complex temporal dependencies is memory, or storing and incorporating\ninformation from previous time steps. The challenge is learning a representation of the entire cumulative\nhistory using bounded storage, which must be updated online as more data is received.\nOne established approach is to model a state that evolves over time as it incorporates more information.\nThe deep learning instantiation of this approach is the recurrent neural network (RNN), which is known to\nsu\ufb00er from a limited memory horizon [ 34,38,56] (e.g., the \u201cvanishing gradients\u201d problem). Although various\nheuristics have been proposed to overcome this, such as gates in the successful LSTM and GRU [16, 34], or\nhigher-order frequencies in the recent Fourier Recurrent Unit [ 79] and Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) [ 71], a\nuni\ufb01ed understanding of memory remains a challenge. Furthermore, existing methods. The table reports\n\ufb01nal normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE)r\nE[(Y\u0000^Y)2]\nE[Y2]between the targets Yand predictions ^Y.\nHiPPO-LegS outperforms the LSTM, LMU, and the best hybrid LSTM+LMU model from [68], reducing\nnormalized MSE by over 30%.\nF.8 Additional Analysis and Ablations of HiPPO\nTo further analyze the tradeo\ufb00s of the memory updates derived from our framework, in Fig. 9 we plot a simple\ninput function f(x) = 1=4sinx+ 1=2sin(x=3) +sin(x=7)to be approximated. The function is subsampled on\nthe rangex2[0;100], creating a sequence of length 1000. This function is simpler than the functions sampled\nfrom white noise signals described in experiments use PyTorch 1.5 and are run on a Nvidia P100 GPU.\nF.2 Permuted MNIST\nTaskThe input to the sequential MNIST (sMNIST) task [ 47] is an MNIST source image, \ufb02attened in\nrow-major order into a single sequence of length 784. The goal of the model is to process the entire image\nsequentially before outputting a classi\ufb01cation label, requiring learning long-term dependencies. A variant of\nthis, the permuted MNIST (pMNIST) task, applies a \ufb01xed permutation to every image, breaking locality and\nfurther straining a model\u2019s capacity for long-term dependencies.\nModels are trained using the cross-entropy loss. We use the standard train-test split (60,000 examples for\ntraining and 10,000 for testing), and further split the training set with 10% to be used as validation set.\n41Baselines and Ablations Table 1 is duplicated here in Tables 4 and 5, with more complete baselines and\nhyperparameter ablations.\nTable 4 consists of our implementations of various baselines related to our method, described in Ap-\npendix F.1. Each method was ran for 3 seeds, and the maximum average validation accuracy is reported.\nAll results than reported in Voelker\net al.[71](possibly due to a larger hidden size).

MBRL techniques achieve the state of the art perfor-\nmance for continuous-control problems with access to a limited number of trials (Chua et al., 2018;\nWang and Ba, 2019) and in controlling systems given only visual observations with no observations\nof the original system\u2019s state (Hafner et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). MBRL approaches typically\nlearn a forward dynamics model that predicts how the dynamical system will evolve when a set of\ncontrol signals are applied. This model is classically \ufb01t with respect to the maximum likelihood of\na set of trajectories collected on the real system, and then used as part of a control algorithm to be\nexecuted on the system (e.g., model-predictive control).\nIn this paper, we highlight a fundamental problem in the MBRL learning scheme: the objective\nmismatch issue.

(2018), and implement all other functions as three dense\nlayers of size 300with ELU activations (Clevert et al., 2015). Distributions in latent space are\n30-dimensional diagonal Gaussians. The action model outputs a tanh mean scaled by a factor of\n5 and a softplus standard deviation for the Normal distribution that is then transformed using tanh\n(Haarnoja et al., 2018). The scaling factor allows the agent to saturate the action distribution.\nLearning updates We draw batches of 50 sequences of length 50 to train the world model, value\nmodel, and action model models using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with learning rates 6\u000210\u00004,\n8\u000210\u00005,8\u000210\u00005, respectively and scale down gradient norms that exceed 100. We do not scale\nthe KL regularizers ( \f= 1) but clip them below 3free nats as in PlaNet. The imagination horizon is\nH= 15 and the same trajectories are used to update both action and value models. We compute the\nV\u0015targets with \r= 0:99and\u0015= 0:95. We did not \ufb01nd latent overshooting for learning the model,\nan entropy bonus for the action model, or target networks for the value model necessary.\nEnvironment interaction The dataset is initialized with S= 5episodes collected using random\nactions. We iterate between 100training steps and collecting 1episode by executing the predicted\nmode action with Normal(0;0:3)exploration noise. Instead of manually selecting the action repeat\nfor each environment as in Hafner et al. (2018) and Lee et al. (2019), we \ufb01x it to 2 for all environments.\nSee Figure 12 for an assessment of the robustness to different action repeat values.\nDiscrete control For", " Introduction\nWith the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine\nlearning tools. Many popular frameworks such as Caffe [ 1], CNTK [ 2], TensorFlow [ 3], and\nTheano [ 4], construct a static data\ufb02ow graph that represents the computation and which can then be\napplied repeatedly to batches of data. This approach provides visibility into the whole computation\nahead of time, and can theoretically be leveraged to improve performance and scalability. However, it\ncomes at the cost of ease of use, ease of debugging, and \ufb02exibility of the types of computation that\ncan be represented.\nPrior work has recognized the value of dynamic eager execution for deep learning, and some recent\nframeworks implement this de\ufb01ne-by-run approach, but do so either at the cost of performance\n(Chainer [ 5]) or using a less expressive, faster language (Torch [ 6], DyNet [ 7]), which limits their\napplicability.\nHowever, with careful implementation and design choices, dynamic eager execution can be achieved\nlargely without sacri\ufb01cing performance. This paper introduces PyTorch, a Python library that\nperforms immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and\nGPU acceleration, and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current\nlibraries for deep learning. This combination has turned out to be very popular in the research\ncommunity with, for instance, 296 ICLR 2019 submissions mentioning PyTorch.\n2 Background\nFour major trends in scienti\ufb01c computing have become increasingly important for deep learning.\nFirst, starting in the 1960s, the development of domain speci\ufb01c languages such as APL [ 8], MATLAB\n[9], R [ 10] and Julia [ 11], turned multidimensional arrays (often referred to as tensors) into \ufb01rst-class\nobjects supported by a comprehensive set of mathematical primitives (or operators) to manipulate\nthem. Separately, libraries such as NumPy[ 12], Torch[ 6], Eigen[ 13] and Lush[ 14] made array-based\nprogramming productive in general purpose languages such as Python, Lisp, C++ and Lua.\nSecond, the development of automatic differentiation [15] made it possible to fully automate\nthe daunting labor of computing derivatives. This made it signi\ufb01cantly easier to experiment with\ndifferent machine learning approaches while still allowing for ef\ufb01cient gradient based optimization.\nThe autograd [ 16] package popularized the use of this technique for NumPy arrays, and similar\napproaches are used in frameworks such as Chainer [ 5], DyNet [ 7], Lush [ 14], Torch [ 6], Jax [ 17]\nand Flux.jl [18].\nThird, with the advent of the free software movement, the scienti\ufb01c community moved away from\nclosed proprietary software such as Matlab[ 9], and towards the open-source Python ecosystem\nwith packages like NumPy [ 12], SciPy [ 19], and Pandas [ 20]. This ful\ufb01lled most of the numerical\nanalysis needs of researchers while allowing them to take advantage of a vast repository of libraries\nto handle dataset preprocessing, statistical analysis, plotting, and more. Moreover, the openness,\ninteroperability, and \ufb02exibility of free software fostered the development of vibrant communities that\ncould quickly address new or changing needs by extending the existing functionality of a library or if\nneeded by developing and releasing brand new ones. While there is a rich offering of open-source\nsoftware for neural networks in languages other than Python, starting with Lush [ 14] in Lisp, Torch [ 6]\nin C++, Objective-C and Lua, EBLearn [ 21] in C++, Caffe", " Introduction\nHumans use memory to reason, imagine, plan, and learn. Memory is a foundational component of\nintelligence, and enables information from past events and contexts to inform decision-making in the\npresent and future. Recently, agents that utilize memory systems have advanced the state of the art\nin various research areas including reasoning, planning, program execution and navigation, among\nothers (Graves et al., 2016; Zambaldi et al., 2018; Santoro et al., 2018; Banino et al., 2018; Vaswani\net al., 2017; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015).\nMemory has many aspects, and having access to different kinds allows intelligent organisms to\nbring the most relevant past information to bear on different sets of circumstances. In cognitive\npsychology and neuroscience, two commonly studied types of memory are working and episodic\nmemory. Working memory (Miyake and Shah, 1999) is a short-term temporary store with limited\ncapacity.\nIn contrast, episodic memory (Tulving and Murray, 1985) is typically a larger autobiographical\ndatabase of experience (e.g. recalling a meal eaten last month) that lets one store information over a\nlonger time scale and compile sequences of events into episodes (Tulving, 2002). Episodic memory\nhas been shown to help reinforcement learning agents adapt more quickly and thereby boost data\n1https://github.com/deepmind/dm_memorytasks. Videos available at https://sites.google.com/view/memory-\ntasks-suite\n33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.arXiv:1910.13406v2  [cs.LG]  19 Feb 2020ef\ufb01ciency (Blundell et al., 2016; Pritzel et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2018). More recently, Ritter et al.\n(2018) shows how episodic memory can be used to provide agents with context-switching abilities\nin contextual bandit problems. The transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) can be viewed as a hybrid\nof working memory and episodic memory that has been successfully applied to many supervised\nlearning problems.\nIn this work, we explore adding such memory systems to agents and propose a consistent and rigorous\napproach for evaluating whether an agent demonstrates generalization-enabling memory capabilities\nsimilar to those seen in animals and humans.\nOne fundamental principle in machine learning is to train on one set of data and test on an unseen\nholdout set, but it has to date been common in reinforcement learning to evaluate agent performance\nsolely on the training set which is suboptimal for testing generalization (Pineau, 2018). Also, though\nadvances have recently been made on evaluating generalization in reinforcement learning (Cobbe\net al., 2018) these have not been speci\ufb01c to memory.\nOur approach is to construct a train-holdout split where the holdout set differs from the training set\nalong axes that we propose are relevant speci\ufb01cally to memory, i.e. the scale of the task and precise\nobjects used in the task environments. For instance, if an agent learns in training to travel to an apple\nplaced in a room, altering the room size or apple color as part of a generalization test should ideally\nnot throw it off.\nWe propose a set of environments that possess such a split and test different aspects of working and\nepisodic memory, to help us better understand when different kinds of memory systems are most\nhelpful and identify memory architectures in agents with memory abilities that cognitive scientists\nand psychologists have observed in humans.\nAlongside these tasks, we develop a benchmark memory-based agent, the Memory Recall Agent\n(MRA), that brings together previously developed systems thought to mimic working memory and\nepisodic memory. This combination of a", " Introduction\nHow to train deep neural networks ef\ufb01ciently is a long-standing challenge. To accelerate model\nconvergence, Ba et al. [3]propose the layer normalization (LayerNorm) which stabilizes the training\nof deep neural networks by regularizing neuron dynamics within one layer via mean and variance\nstatistics. Due to its simplicity and requiring no dependencies among training cases, LayerNorm\nhas been widely applied to different neural architectures, which enables remarkable success on\nvarious tasks ranging from computer vision [ 19,26], speech recognition [ 37] to natural language\nprocessing [ 31,35]. In some cases, LayerNorm was found to be essential for successfully training a\nmodel [ 6]. Besides, the decoupling from batch-based samples endows LayerNorm with the superiority\nover batch normalization (BatchNorm) [12] in handling variable-length sequences using RNNs.\nUnfortunately, the incorporation of LayerNorm raises computational overhead. Although this is\nnegligible to small and shallow neural models with few normalization layers, this problem becomes\nsevere when underlying networks grow larger and deeper. As a result, the ef\ufb01ciency gain from\nfaster and more stable training (in terms of number of training steps) is counter-balanced by an\nincreased computational cost per training step, which diminishes the net ef\ufb01ciency, as show in Figure\n1. One major feature of LayerNorm that is widely regarded as contributions to the stabilization is its\nre-centering invariance property: the summed inputs after LayerNorm remain intact when the inputs\nor weight matrix is shifted by some amount of noise. We argue that this mean normalization does not\nreduce the variance of hidden states or model gradients, and hypothesize that it has little impact on\nthe success of LayerNorm.\nIn this paper, we propose root mean square layer normalization (RMSNorm), which regularizes\nthe summed inputs to a neuron in one layer with the root mean square (RMS) statistic alone.\n33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.arXiv:1910.07467v1  [cs.LG]  16 Oct 20190 20 40 60 80 100\nTraining Step (x 100)45678910Loss7.0\n5.4Baseline\nLayerNorm(a) Training loss vs. training steps.\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\nTraining Time (in minutes)45678910Loss7.0\n5.9Baseline\nLayerNorm (b) Training loss vs. training time.\nFigure 1: Training procedure of a GRU-based RNNSearch [ 4] for the \ufb01rst 10k training steps. Baseline means the\noriginal model without any normalization. When the Baseline training loss arrives at 7.0, the loss of LayerNorm\nreaches 5.4 after the same number of training steps 1(a), but only 5.9 after the same training time 1(b).\nRMSNorm reduces the amount of computation and increases ef\ufb01ciency over LayerNorm. Despite the\nsimpler formulation, the RMS normalizer helps stabilize the magnitude of layer activations, ensuring\ninvariance to the re-scaling of both weights and datasets. We also show the possibility of estimating\nRMS on a subset of the summed inputs, maintaining this invariance property. Assuming that the\nsummed inputs have an independent identically distributed structure, we propose partial RMSNorm,\nwhere only the \ufb01rst p% summed inputs are utilized for RMS estimation.\nWe thoroughly examine our model on various tasks, including machine translation, image classi\ufb01ca-\ntion, image-caption retrieval and question answering.

(2017) see as a \u201ddominant concern in RL\u201d.\nHaarnoja et al. (2018) provide the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm which helps deal with this concern in continuous\naction settings. It has achieved model-free state-of-the-art sample ef\ufb01ciency in multiple challenging continuous control\ndomains. Many domains however involve discrete rather than continuous actions and in these environments SAC is not\ncurrently applicable. This paper derives a version of SAC that is applicable to discrete action domains and then shows\nthat it is competitive with the model-free state-of-the-art for discrete action domains in terms of sample ef\ufb01ciency on a\nselection of games from the Atari [Bellemare et al., 2013] suite.\nWe proceed as follows: \ufb01rst we explain the derivation of Soft Actor-Critic for continuous action settings found in\nHaarnoja et al. (2018) and Haarnoja et al. (2019), then we derive and explain the changes required to create a discrete\naction version of the algorithm, and \ufb01nally we test the discrete action algorithm on the Atari suite.\n2 Soft Actor-Critic\nSoft Actor-Critic [Haarnoja et al., 2018] attempts to \ufb01nd a policy that maximises the maximum entropy objective:\n\u0019\u0003= argmax\n\u0019TX\nt=0E(st;at)\u0018\u001c\u0019[\rt(r(st;at) +\u000bH(\u0019(:jst))] (1)\nwhere\u0019is a policy,\u0019\u0003is the optimal policy, Tis the number of timesteps, r:S\u0002A!Ris the reward function,\n\r2[0;1]is the discount rate, st2Sis the state at timestep t, at2Ais the action at timestep t, \u001c\u0019is the distribution\nof trajectories induced by policy \u0019,\u000bdetermines the relative importance of the entropy term versus the reward and\nis called the temperature parameter, and H(\u0019(:jst)is the entropy of the policy \u0019at statestand is calculated as\nH(\u0019(:jst)) =\u0000log\u0019(:jst).\nTo maximise the objective the authors use soft policy iteration which is a method of alternating between policy evaluation\nand policy improvement within the maximum entropy framework.arXiv:1910.07207v2  [cs.LG]  18 Oct 2019The policy evaluation step involves computing the value of policy \u0019. To do this they \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the soft state value\nfunction as:\nV(st):=Eat\u0018\u0019[Q(st;at)\u0000\u000blog(\u0019(atjst))] (2)\nThey then prove that in a tabular setting (i.e. when the state space is discrete) we can obtain the soft q-function by\nstarting from a randomly initialised function Q:S\u0002A!Rand repeatedly applying the modi\ufb01ed Bellman backup\noperatorT\u0019given by:\nT\u0019Q(st;at):=r(st;at) +\rEst+1\u0018p(st;at)[V(st+1)] (3)\nwherep:S\u0002A!Sgives the distribution over the next state given the current state and action.\nIn the continuous state (instead of tabular) setting they explain that we instead \ufb01rstly parameterise the soft q-function\nQ\u0012(st;at)using a neural network with parameters \u0012. Then we train the soft Q-function to minimise the soft Bellman\nresidual:\nJQ(\u0012) =E(st;at)\u0018D[1\n2(Q\u0012(st;at)\u0000(r(st;at) +\rEst+1\u0018p(st;at)[V\u0016\u0012(st+1)]))2] (4)\nwhere D is a replay buffer of past experiences and V\u0016\u0012(st+1)is estimated using a target network for Qand a monte-carlo\nestimate of (2) after sampling experiences from the replay buffer .\nThe policy improvement step then involves updating the policy in a direction that maximises the rewards it will achieve.\nTo do this they use the soft Q-function calculated in the policy evaluation step to guide changes to the policy. Speci\ufb01cally,\nthey update the policy towards the exponential of the new soft Q-function.", " INTRODUCTION\nParallel computing is rapidly transforming from a scientists\u2019\ncomputational tool to a general purpose computational paradigm.\nThe availability of affordable massively-parallel graphics processing\nunits (GPUs) as well as widely-available parallel grid and cloud\ncomputing systems [1]\u2013[3] drive this transformation by bringing\nparallel computing technology to everyday use. This creates a demand\nfor parallel algorithms that can harness the full power of the parallel\ncomputing hardware.\nStochastic state-space models allow for modeling of time-\nbehaviour and uncertainties of dynamic systems, and they have long\nbeen used in various tracking, automation, communications, and\nimaging applications [4]\u2013[8].

N UMERICAL EXPERIMENT\nIn order to illustrate", " Introduction\nState-estimation in unstructured environments is a very chal-\nlenging task as observations or measurements of the envi-\nronment are often high-dimensional and only provide partial\ninformation about the state. Images are a good example:\nEven for low resolution, the number of pixels can quickly\nexceed tens or hundreds of thousands and it is impossible\nto obtain any information about the dynamics, such as ve-\nlocities, from a single image. Additionally, the observations\nmay be noisy or may not contain useful information for the\ntask at hand. Such noise can, for example, be introduced by\npoor illumination or motion blur and occlusions can prevent\nus from observing some or all relevant aspects of the scene.\nIn addition to state estimation, it is also often desirable to\npredict future states or observations, for example, in order\nto assess the consequences of future actions. To this end, an\ninitial estimate of the current state is necessary which again\nhas to be inferred from observations. In such environments,\nwe typically also have to deal with high uncertainties in\nthe state estimates. Being able to model this uncertainty\nis crucial in many decision making scenarios, e.g., if we\nneed to decide to perform an action now or wait until more\ninformation about the scene is available.\nDeep learning models have been very successful for time-\nseries modelling in unstructured environments. Classical\nmodels such as LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)\nor GRUs (Cho et al., 2014) perform well but fail to capture\nthe uncertainty of the state estimate. Recent probabilistic\ndeep learning approaches have used the Kalman Filter (KF)\nas a tool to integrate uncertainty estimates into deep time-\nseries modelling (Haarnoja et al., 2016; Watter et al., 2015;\nArcher et al., 2015; Fraccaro et al., 2017; Krishnan et al.,\n2017). These approaches use the KF to perform inference\nin a low-dimensional (latent) state space that is typically\nde\ufb01ned by a deep encoder. However, using KF in such a\nstate space comes with two main limitations. In order to\nbe usable for non-linear dynamics, we have to introduce\napproximations such as the extended KF (Haarnoja et al.,\n2016) and variational inference methods. We also computed the quality of\nthe uncertainty prediction by showing the histograms ofRecurrent Kalman Networks: Factorized Inference in High-Dimensional Deep Feature Spaces\nTable 4. Related Work\nUsing encoders for time-series modelling of high-\ndimensional data such as images is a common approach.\nSuch encoders can also be easily integrated with well known\ndeep time-series models such as LSTMs (Hochreiter &\nSchmidhuber, 1997) or GRUs (Cho et al., 2014).

More\nimportantly, the maximum entropy formulation provides a substantial improvement in exploration\nand robustness: as discussed by Ziebart (2010), maximum entropy policies are robust in the face of\nmodel and estimation errors, and as demonstrated by (Haarnoja et al., 2017), they improve exploration\nby acquiring diverse behaviors.

First, model-based plan-\nning can be more data ef\ufb01cient because it leverages a richer\ntraining signal and does not require propagating rewards\nthrough Bellman backups. Moreover, planning carries the\npromise of increasing performance just by increasing the\ncomputational budget for searching for actions, as shown\nby Silver et al. (2017). Finally, learned dynamics can be\nindependent of any speci\ufb01c task and thus have the potential\nto transfer well to other tasks in the environment.\nRecent work has shown promise in learning the dynamics of\nsimple low-dimensional environments (Deisenroth & Ras-\nmussen, 2011; Gal et al., 2016; Amos et al., 2018; Chua\net al., 2018; Henaff et al., 2018). However, these approaches\ntypically assume access to the underlying state of the world\nand the reward function, which may not be available in prac-\ntice. In high-dimensional environments, we would like to\nlearn the dynamics in a compact latent space to enable fast\nplanning. The success of such latent models has previously\nbeen limited to simple tasks such as balancing cartpoles and\ncontrolling 2-link arms from dense rewards (Watter et al.,\n2015; Banijamali et al., 2017).\nIn this paper, we propose the Deep Planning Network\n(PlaNet), a model-based agent that learns the environment\ndynamics from pixels and chooses actions through online\nplanning in a compact latent space. To learn the dynamics,\nwe use a transition model with both stochastic and determin-\nistic components. Moreover, we experiment with a novel\ngeneralized variational objective that encourages multi-step\npredictions. PlaNet solves continuous control tasks from\npixels that are more dif\ufb01cult than those previously solved\nby planning with learned models.\nKey contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\u000fPlanning in latent spaces We solve a variety of tasks\nfrom the DeepMind control suite, shown in Figure 1, by\nlearning a dynamics model and ef\ufb01ciently planning inarXiv:1811.04551v5  [cs.LG]  4 Jun 2019Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels\n(a) Cartpole\n (b) Reacher\n (c) Cheetah\n (d) Finger\n (e) Cup\n (f) Walker\nFigure 1: Image-based control domains used in our experiments above.

Let\u0019ibe the policy at iteration i. By Lemma 2, the sequence Q\u0019iis monotonically increasing. Since Q\u0019is bounded\nabove for\u00192\u0005(both the reward and entropy are bounded), the sequence converges to some \u0019\u0003. We will still need to\nshow that\u0019\u0003is indeed optimal. At convergence, it must be case that J\u0019\u0003(\u0019\u0003(\u0001jst))<J\u0019\u0003(\u0019(\u0001jst))for all\u00192\u0005,\u00196=\u0019\u0003.\nUsing the same iterative argument as in the proof of Lemma 2, we get Q\u0019\u0003(st;at)>Q\u0019(st;at)for all (st;at)2S\u0002A ,\nthat is, the soft value of any other policy in \u0005is lower than that of the converged policy. Hence \u0019\u0003is optimal in \u0005.\nC. Enforcing Action Bounds\nWe use an unbounded Gaussian as the action distribution. However, in practice, the actions needs to be bounded to a \ufb01nite\ninterval. To that end, we apply an invertible squashing function ( tanh ) to the Gaussian samples, and employ the change of\nvariables formula to compute the likelihoods of the bounded actions. In the other words, let u2RDbe a random variable\nand\u0016(ujs)the corresponding density with in\ufb01nite support.

The leading contenders are deep Q-learning [Mni+15],\n\u201cvanilla\u201d policy gradient Background: Policy Optimization\n2.1 Policy Gradient Methods\nIn TRPO [Sch+15b], an objective function (the \u201csurrogate\u201d objective) is maximized subject to a\nconstraint on the size of the policy update. Speci\ufb01cally,\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At/bracketrightbigg\n(3)\nsubject to \u02c6Et[KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]]\u2264\u03b4. (4)\nHere,\u03b8oldis the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can e\ufb03ciently be\napproximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation\nto the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.\nThe theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,\nsolving the unconstrained optimization problem\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]/bracketrightbigg\n(5)\nfor some coe\ufb03cient \u03b2. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes\nthe max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the\nperformance of the policy \u03c0. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard\nto choose a single value of \u03b2that performs well across di\ufb00erent problems\u2014or even within a single\nproblem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal\nof a \ufb01rst-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Experiments\n6.1 Comparison of Surrogate Objectives\nFirst, we compare several di\ufb00erent surrogate objectives under di\ufb00erent hyperparameters. Here, we\ncompare the surrogate objective LCLIPto several natural variations and ablated versions.\nNo clipping or penalty: Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\nClipping: Lt(\u03b8) = min(rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At,clip(rt(\u03b8)),1\u2212/epsilon1,1 +/epsilon1)\u02c6At\nKL penalty (\ufb01xed or adaptive) Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old,\u03c0\u03b8]\n5For the KL penalty, one can either use a \ufb01xed penalty coe\ufb03cient \u03b2or an adaptive coe\ufb03cient as\ndescribed in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2\nimplemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do\none million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping ( /epsilon1)\nand the KL penalty ( \u03b2,dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in\nTable 3.\nTo represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,\nand tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard\ndeviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don\u2019t share parameters between the policy and value\nfunction (so coe\ufb03cient c1is irrelevant), and we don\u2019t use an entropy bonus.\nEach algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each\nrun of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted\nand scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best\nresult was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.\nThe Results from continuous control benchmark. Average normalized scores (over 21 runs of the\nalgorithm, on 7 environments) for each algorithm / hyperparameter setting . \u03b2was initialized at 1.\n6.2 Comparison to Other Algorithms in the", " Introduction\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction", "Abstract \u2014 Two less addressed issues of deep reinforcement\nlearning are (1) lack of generalization capability to new target\ngoals, and (2) data inef\ufb01ciency i.e., the model requires several\n(and often costly) episodes of trial and error to converge, which\nmakes it impractical to be applied to real-world scenarios. In\nthis paper, we address these two issues and apply our model\nto the task of target-driven visual navigation.

This success has been extended to reinforcement\nlearning (RL) problems that involve visual perception. For\nexample, the Deep Q-Network (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015)\narchitecture has been shown to successfully learn to play\nmany Atari 2600 games in the Arcade Learning Environ-\nment (ALE) benchmark (Bellemare et al., 2013) by learn-\ning visual features useful for control directly from raw pix-\nels using Q-Learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992).\nProceedings of the 33rdInternational Conference on Machine\nLearning , New York, NY , USA, 2016.

Most of these\nadvances, however, are restricted to the supervised learn-\ning setting, which provides clear error signals.

Our RL tasks (one exam-\nple is illustrated in Figure 1) not only have the usual RL\nchallenges of partial observability, high-dimensional (vi-\nsual) perception, and delayed reward, but also require an\nagent to develop movement policies by learning how to use\nits active perception to observe useful information and col-\nlect reward. In addition, our RL tasks require an agent to\nlearn to use any memory it possesses including its interac-\ntion with active perception which feeds observations into\n1https://minecraft.net/arXiv:1605.09128v1  [cs.AI]  30 May 2016Control of Memory, Active Perception, and Action in Minecraft\nmemory.

The architectures we\nintroduce use memory mechanisms similar to MemNN, but\nour architectures have a layer that constructs a query for\nmemory retrieval based on temporal context. Our architec-\ntures are also similar to NTM in that a recurrent controller\ninteracts with an external memory, but ours have a simpler\nwriting and addressing mechanism which makes them eas-\nier to train. Most importantly, our architectures are used in\nan RL", " Introduction\nThe use of neural networks for solving continuous control problems has a long tradition. Several\nrecent papers successfully apply model-free, direct policy search methods can roughly be divided into two\nbroad classes:\nOn the one hand there are approaches that explicitly maintain a belief state that corresponds to\nthe distribution over the world state given the observations so far. This approach has two major\ndisadvantages: The \ufb01rst is the need for a model, and the second is the computational cost that is\ntypically associated with the update of the belief state [8, 23].\n1arXiv:1512.04455v1  [cs.LG]  14 Dec 2015On the other hand there are model free approaches that learn to form memories based on interactions\nwith the world. This is challenging since it is a priori unknown which features of the observations\nwill be relevant later, and associations may have to be formed over many steps. For this reason, most\nmodel free approaches tend to assume the fully-observed case. In practice, partial observability is\noften solved by hand-crafting a solution such as providing multiple-frames at each timestep to allow\nvelocity estimation [16, 14].\nIn this work we investigate a natural extension of two recent, closely related policy gradient algo-\nrithms for learning continuous-action policies to handle partially observed problems. We primarily\nconsider the Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DPG) [24], which is an off-policy policy\ngradient algorithm that has recently produced promising results.\n7(a)\n (b)\n (c)\nFigure 4: RDPG was able to learn good policies directly from high-dimensional renderings for\npendulum (a), and a two choice reaching task with a disappearing target (b). (c) Example frame\nfrom the reaching task.\n5 Background\nWe model our environment as discrete-time, partially-observed Markov Decision process (POMDP).\nA POMDP is described a set of environment states Sand a set of actions A, an initial state distribu-\ntionp0(s0), a transition function p(st+1jst;at)and reward function r(st;at). This underlying MDP\nis partially observed when the agent is unable to observe the state stdirectly and instead receives\nobservations from the set Owhich are conditioned on the underlying state p(otjst).\nThe agent only indirectly observes the underlying state of the MDP through the observations. An\noptimal agent may, in principle, require access to the entire history ht= (o1;a1;o2;a2;:::at\u00001;ot).\nThe goal of the agent is thus to learn a policy \u0019(ht)which maps from the history to a distribution over\nactionsP(A)which maximizes the expected discounted reward (below we consider both stochastic\nand deterministic policies). For stochastic policies we want to maximise\nJ=E\u001c\"1X\nt=1\rt\u00001r(st;at)#\n; (1)\nwhere the trajectories \u001c= (s1;o1;a1;s2;:::)are drawn from the trajectory distribution induced by\nthe policy\u0019:p(s1)p(o1js1)\u0019(a1jh1)p(s2js1;a1)p(o2js2)\u0019(a2jh2):::and wherehtis de\ufb01ned as\nabove. For deterministic policies we replace \u0019with a deterministic function \u0016which maps directly\nfrom statesSto actionsAand we replace at\u0018\u0019(\u0001jht)withat=\u0016(ht).\nIn the algorithms below we make use of the action-value function Q\u0019. For a fully observed MDP,\nwhen we have access to s, the action-value function is de\ufb01ned as the expected future discounted\nreward when in state stthe agent takes action atand thereafter follows policy \u0019. Since we are\n2interested in the partially observed case where the agent does not have access to swe instead de\ufb01ne\nQ\u0019in terms ofh:\nQ\u0019(ht;at) =Estjht[rt(st;at)] +E\u001c>tjht;at\"1X\ni=1\rir(st+i;at+i)#\n(2)\nwhere\u001c>t= (st+1;ot+1;at+1:::)is the future trajectory and the two expectations are taken with\nrespect to the conditionals p(stjht)andp(\u001c>tjht;at)of the trajectory distribution associated with\n\u0019. Note that this equivalent to de\ufb01ning Q\u0019in terms of the belief state since", " Introduction . MIT Press.\nTieleman, T., and Hinton, G. 2012.

The targets\nat each timestep are generated from the target Q-network,\n^Q. The RNN\u2019s hidden state is carried forward throughout\nthe episode.\nBootstrapped Random Updates : Episodes are selected\nrandomly from the replay memory and updates begin at ran-\ndom points in the episode and proceed for only unroll itera-\ntions timesteps (e.g. one backward call). The targets at each\ntimestep are generated from the target Q-network, ^Q. The\nRNN\u2019s initial state is zeroed at the start of the update.\nSequential updates have the advantage of carrying the\nLSTM\u2019s hidden state forward from the beginning of the\nepisode. However, by sampling experiences sequentially for\na full episode, they violate DQN\u2019s random sampling policy.Random updates better adhere to the policy of randomly\nsampling experience, but, as a consequence, the LSTM\u2019s\nhidden state must be zeroed at the start of each update. Ze-\nroing the hidden state makes it harder for the LSTM to learn\nfunctions that span longer time scales than the number of\ntimesteps reached by back propagation through time.

Appendix C: Flickering Related Work\nPreviously, LSTM networks have been demonstrated to\nsolve POMDPs when trained using policy gradient meth-\nods (Wierstra et al. 2007). In contrast to policy gradient,\nour work uses temporal-difference updates to bootstrap an\naction-value function. Additionally, by jointly training con-\nvolutional and LSTM layers we are able to learn directly\nfrom pixels and do not require hand-engineered features.\nLSTM has been used as an advantage-function approxi-\nmator and shown to solve a partially observable corridor and\ncartpole tasks better better than comparable (non-LSTM)\nRNNs (Bakker 2001). While similar in principle, the cor-\nridor and cartpole tasks feature tiny states spaces with just a\nfew features.\nIn parallel to our work, (Narasimhan, Kulkarni, and Barzi-\nlay 2015) independently combined LSTM with Deep Re-\ninforcement Learning to demonstrate that recurrency helps\nto better play text-based fantasy games. The approach is\nsimilar but the domains differ: despite the apparent com-\nplexity of the fantasy-generated text, the underlying MDPs\nfeature relatively low-dimensional manifolds of underlying\nstate space. The more complex of the two games features\nonly 56 underlying states. Atari games, in contrast, feature\na much richer state space with typical games having mil-\nlions of different states. However, the action space of the text\ngames is much larger with a branching factor of 222 versus\nAtari\u2019s 18. Discussion and Conclusion\nReal-world tasks often feature incomplete", " Introduction\nA new approach for statistical machine transla-\ntion based purely on neural networks has recently\nbeen proposed (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;\nSutskever et al., 2014). This new approach, which\nwe refer to as neural machine translation , is in-\nspired by the recent trend of deep representational\nlearning. All the neural network models used in\n(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et\nal., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) consist of an encoder\nand a decoder. The encoder extracts a \ufb01xed-length\nvector representation from a variable-length input\nsentence, and from this representation the decoder\n\u0003Research done while visiting Universit \u00b4e de Montr \u00b4ealgenerates a correct, variable-length target transla-\ntion.\nThe emergence of the neural machine transla-\ntion is highly signi\ufb01cant, both practically and the-\noretically. Neural machine translation models re-\nquire only a fraction of the memory needed by\ntraditional statistical machine translation (SMT)\nmodels. The models we trained for this paper\nrequire only 500MB of memory in total. This\nstands in stark contrast with existing SMT sys-\ntems, which often require tens of gigabytes of\nmemory. This makes the neural machine trans-\nlation appealing in practice. Furthermore, un-\nlike conventional translation systems, each and ev-\nery component of the neural translation model is\ntrained jointly to maximize the translation perfor-\nmance.\nAs this approach is relatively new, there has not\nbeen much work on analyzing the properties and\nbehavior of these models. For instance: What\nare the properties of sentences on which this ap-\nproach performs better? How does the choice of\nsource/target vocabulary affect the performance?\nIn which cases does the neural machine translation\nfail?\nIt is crucial to understand the properties and be-\nhavior of this new neural machine translation ap-\nproach in order to determine future research di-\nrections. Also, understanding the weaknesses and\nstrengths of neural machine translation might lead\nto better ways of integrating SMT and neural ma-\nchine translation systems.\nIn this paper, we analyze two neural machine\ntranslation models. One of them is the RNN\nEncoder\u2013Decoder that was proposed recently in\n(Cho et al., 2014). The other model replaces the\nencoder in the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder model with\na novel neural network, which we call a gated\nrecursive convolutional neural network (grConv).\nWe evaluate these two models on the task of trans-\nlation from French to English.arXiv:1409.1259v2  [cs.CL]  7 Oct 2014Our analysis shows that the performance of\nthe neural machine translation model degrades\nquickly as the length of a source sentence in-\ncreases. Furthermore, we \ufb01nd that the vocabulary\nsize has a high impact on the translation perfor-\nmance. Nonetheless, qualitatively we \ufb01nd that the\nboth models are able to generate correct transla-\ntions most of the time. Furthermore, the newly\nproposed grConv model is able to learn, without\nsupervision, a kind of syntactic structure over the\nsource language.\n2 Neural Networks for Variable-Length\nSequences\nIn this section, we describe two types of neural\nnetworks that are able to process variable-length\nsequences. These are the recurrent neural net-\nwork and the proposed gated recursive convolu-\ntional neural network.\n2.1 Recurrent Neural Network with Gated\nHidden Neurons\nz\nrh h~x\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1: The graphical illustration of (a) the re-\ncurrent neural network and (b) the hidden unit that\nadaptively forgets and remembers.\nA recurrent neural network (RNN, Fig. 1 (a))\nworks on a variable-length sequence x=\n(x1;x2;\u0001\u0001\u0001;xT)by maintaining a hidden state h\nover time.

The lower table reports Background\nWe consider tasks in which an agent interacts with an environment E, in this case the Atari emulator,\nin a sequence of actions, observations and rewards. At each time-step the agent selects an action\natfrom the set of legal game actions, A=f1;:::;Kg. The action is passed to the emulator and\nmodi\ufb01es its internal state and the game score. In general Emay be stochastic. The emulator\u2019s\ninternal state is not observed by the agent; instead it observes an image xt2Rdfrom the emulator,\nwhich is a vector of raw pixel values representing the current screen. In addition it receives a reward\nrtrepresenting the change in game score. Note that in general the game score may depend on the\nwhole prior sequence of actions and observations; feedback about an action may only be received\nafter many thousands of time-steps have elapsed.\nSince the agent only observes images of the current screen, the task is partially observed and many\nemulator states are perceptually aliased, i.e. it is impossible to fully understand the current situation\nfrom only the current screen xt. We therefore consider sequences of actions and observations, st=\nx1;a1;x2;:::;at\u00001;xt, and learn game strategies that depend upon these sequences. All sequences\nin the emulator are assumed to terminate in a \ufb01nite number of time-steps. This formalism gives\nrise to a large but \ufb01nite Markov decision process (MDP) in which each sequence is a distinct state.\nAs a result, we can apply standard reinforcement learning Related Work\nPerhaps the best-known success story of reinforcement learning is TD-gammon , a backgammon-\nplaying program which learnt entirely by reinforcement learning and self-play, and achieved a super-\nhuman level of play [24]. TD-gammon used a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm similar\nto Q-learning, and approximated the value function using a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden\nlayer1.\nHowever, early attempts to follow up on TD-gammon, including applications of the same method to\nchess, Go and checkers were less successful. This led to a widespread belief that the TD-gammon\napproach was a special case that only worked in backgammon, perhaps because the stochasticity in\nthe dice rolls helps explore the state space and also makes the value function particularly smooth\n[19].\nFurthermore, it was shown that combining model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-\nlearning with non-linear function approximators [25], or indeed with off-policy learning [1] could\ncause the Q-network to diverge. Subsequently, the majority of work in reinforcement learning fo-\ncused on linear function approximators with better convergence guarantees [25].\n1In fact TD-Gammon approximated the state value function V(s)rather than the action-value function\nQ(s; a), and learnt on-policy directly from the self-play games\n3More recently, there has been a revival of interest in combining deep learning with reinforcement\nlearning. Deep neural networks have been used to estimate the environment E; restricted Boltzmann\nmachines have been used to estimate the value function [21]; or the policy [9].

In practice, we usuall y ex-\nplore the unknown by collecting consumers\u2019 feedback in real time\ntoevaluatethepopularityofnewcontentwhilemonitoringc hanges\nin its value [3]. For instance, a small amount of traf\ufb01c can be des-\nignated for such exploration. Based on the users\u2019 response ( such\nas clicks) to randomly selected content on this small slice o f traf-\n\ufb01c,the most popular content can be identi\ufb01edand exploited o nthe\nremaining traf\ufb01c. This strategy, with random exploration o n an\u01eb\nfraction of the traf\ufb01c and greedy exploitation on the rest, i s known\nas\u01eb-greedy. Advanced exploration approaches such as EXP3[8]\norUCB1[7] could be applied as well. Intuitively, we need to dis-\ntribute more traf\ufb01c to new content to learn its value more qui ckly,\nand fewer users totracktemporal changes of existingconten t.\nRecently, personalized recommendation has become a desira ble\nfeature for websites to improve user satisfaction by tailor ing con-\ntent presentation to suit individual users\u2019 needs [10]. Per sonal-\nization involves a process of gathering and storing user att ributes,\nmanaging content assets, and, based on an analysis of curren t and\npast users\u2019 behavior, delivering the individually best con tent to the\npresent user beingserved.\nOften, both users and content are represented by sets of fea-\ntures. User features may include historical activities at a n aggre-\ngated level as well as declared demographic information. Co ntent\nfeaturesmaycontaindescriptiveinformationandcategori es. Inthis\nscenario,explorationandexploitationhavetobedeployed atanin-\ndividual level since the views of different users on the same con-\ntent canvarysigni\ufb01cantly. Since theremaybe a verylargenu mber\nof possible choices or actions available, it becomes critic al to rec-\nognize commonalities between content items and to transfer that\nknowledge across the content pool.\nTraditional recommender systems, including collaborativ e \ufb01l-\ntering, content-based \ufb01ltering and hybrid approaches, can provide\nmeaningful recommendations at an individual level by lever aging\nusers\u2019interestsasdemonstratedbytheirpastactivity.

Content-\nbased \ufb01ltering helps to identify new items which well match a nexisting user\u2019s consumption pro\ufb01le, but the recommended it ems\nare always similar to the items previously taken by the user [ 20].\nHybrid approaches [11] have been developed by combining two\nor more recommendation techniques; for example, the inabil ity of\ncollaborative \ufb01ltering to recommend new items is commonly a lle-\nviated bycombining it withcontent-based \ufb01ltering.\nHowever,asnotedabove,inmanyweb-basedscenarios,theco n-\ntent universe undergoes frequent changes, with content pop ular-\nity changing over time as well.

{"paper_key": "Research on Predicting Public Opinion Event Heat Levels Based on Large Language Models", "current_5q": "### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nHow can large language models (LLMs) be effectively utilized to predict the heat levels of public opinion events based on their network dissemination heat index?\n\n### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nSolving this problem has significant implications for the research community as it can enhance the understanding of public sentiment dynamics and improve the predictive capabilities of LLMs in specialized domains. By accurately predicting the influence of trending events, researchers can develop better tools for social analysis, marketing strategies, and crisis management. This advancement could lead to practical applications in various fields, including media, politics, and public relations, ultimately fostering more informed decision-making processes.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of accurately modeling public opinion dynamics, which are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors. Naive approaches may fail due to the lack of sufficient training data for high-heat events, leading to poor generalization. Additionally, the uneven distribution of event heat levels in the dataset complicates the learning process, making it difficult for models to predict accurately across all categories. Technical obstacles include the need for effective clustering algorithms and the integration of contextual information from similar cases to enhance prediction accuracy.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on the application of LLMs in specialized domains without addressing the specific challenge of predicting the heat levels of public opinion events. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive datasets that cover a wide range of event heat levels and insufficient methodologies for leveraging similar case references. This study proposes a novel approach by utilizing a large dataset of trending events and employing advanced clustering techniques, which differ from prior work by focusing specifically on the prediction of event heat levels rather than general sentiment analysis.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nThe proposed methodology involves preprocessing and classifying a dataset of 62,836 trending events in China, followed by automated clustering using the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm to categorize events into four heat levels. The evaluation will utilize various LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V2, to assess their accuracy in predicting heat levels under two scenarios: with and without reference cases. The expected outcomes include improved prediction accuracy, particularly for low-heat events, and insights into the factors affecting model performance across different heat levels, ultimately contributing to the advancement of public opinion analysis using LLMs.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nHow can we effectively integrate large language models with graph-based representations, such as Gomory-Hu trees, to enhance legal reasoning and public sentiment analysis in real-time legal contexts?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nThis research addresses the critical intersection of legal reasoning and public sentiment, which is vital for developing responsive legal systems that align with societal needs. By solving this problem, we can significantly advance the field of Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI), offering new methodologies that improve the accuracy and efficiency of legal decision-making. The implications extend beyond academia; policymakers and legal practitioners will gain timely insights into public opinion trends, which can inform legislative actions and legal reforms. Furthermore, this research could lead to practical applications, such as tools that support lawyers in case preparation and public engagement strategies that enhance the legal system's transparency and accountability.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexity of integrating large language models (LLMs) with graph-based structures lies in the challenge of effectively merging two fundamentally different paradigms: the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the deterministic structure of graphs. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent difficulty in translating semantic legal reasoning into graph representations while maintaining contextual relevance. Additionally, the dynamic nature of public sentiment requires real-time analysis that can adapt to rapidly changing social media landscapes. Technical obstacles include ensuring the accuracy of sentiment predictions, managing the volume of data from social media, and developing algorithms that can handle the nuanced language of legal discourse. Theoretical challenges also arise in defining how to quantify and represent legal reasoning processes within a graph framework.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either legal reasoning or sentiment analysis in isolation, often neglecting their interplay. While existing studies have explored the capabilities of LLMs in legal text processing and abductive reasoning, they have not addressed the integration of these models with dynamic public sentiment analysis. Barriers include a lack of comprehensive datasets that encompass both legal reasoning and public opinion, as well as insufficient methodologies for synthesizing these data types. Our approach seeks to fill these gaps by creating a hybrid framework that leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on legal datasets alongside real-time social media sentiment analysis, thus improving upon prior work by providing a more holistic view of legal and public sentiment interactions.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology consists of developing a hybrid framework that integrates LLMs with Gomory-Hu trees to model legal reasoning while simultaneously performing sentiment analysis on real-time social media data. We will utilize a fine-tuned LLM trained on a specialized legal dataset and combine it with dynamic sentiment analysis algorithms to track shifts in public opinion. The dataset will include annotated legal cases and sentiment-labeled social media posts related to ongoing legal events. We will measure the success of our approach using metrics that evaluate both the accuracy of legal reasoning and the precision of sentiment predictions. Expected outcomes include enhanced legal decision-making tools that provide policymakers with actionable insights into public sentiment, ultimately improving the responsiveness of legal systems to societal needs.", "referenced_intros": ["

processing (NLP) t asks, including natural language under-\nstanding [Dong et al., 2019], reasoning [Huang and Chang, 20 23], and generation [Yu et al., 2022].\nBoth proprietary and open-source LLMs exhibit strong gener alization capabilities, enabling their\napplication in diverse downstream scenarios, such as medic ine [Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023], \ufb01-\nnance [Yang et al., 2023b], education [Gan et al., 2023]. Rec ent studies [Fei et al., 2023, Nguyen,\n2023] have demonstrated the preliminary effectiveness of e xisting general LLMs in legal tasks, in-\ncluding legal judgment prediction [Luo et al., 2017], legal documents retrieval [Chen et al., 2013],\nand legal question answering [Zhong et al., 2020a].\nDespite the preliminary effectiveness of LLMs in legal appl ications, there are two obstacles that\nhinder their practical use in legal tasks. On the one hand, pr oprietary LLMs such as GPT-\n4 [OpenAI, 2023b] and GPT-3.5 Turbo [OpenAI, 2023a] can only be accessed through APIs, which\ndo not guarantee data privacy in sensitive legal cases. On th e other hand, open-source LLMs like\nLLaMA [Touvron et al., 2023a] and ChatGLM [Du et al., 2022] fa il to achieve satisfactory perfor-\nmance due to their insuf\ufb01cient legal knowledge and incompat ibility with downstream legal tasks.\nTechnical report.Therefore, it is necessary to develop a open-source LLM spec i\ufb01cally designed for legal applications\nin order to overcome the existing obstacles.\nIn this paper, we introduce L AWGPT, the \ufb01rst open-source Chinese legal knowledge-enhance d large\nlanguage model. With the advantage of being open-source, L AWGPT can be self-hosted and ac-\ncessed privately to ensure data privacy, as compared to prop rietary models. We then present legal-\noriented pre-training, which utilizes our large-scale leg al pre-training corpus to incorporate domain-\nspeci\ufb01c legal knowledge into L AWGPT, improving its understanding, reasoning, and generati on\nfoundational capabilities in legal tasks. Additionally, w e propose legal supervised \ufb01ne-tuning, em-\nploying our knowledge-driven instruction dataset to furth er enhance L AWGPT\u2019s performance on\ndownstream legal tasks. Experimental Related Work\nIn this section, we review the existing work on addressing le gal tasks using LLMs. This focus is on\ngeneral language models, legal language models, and legal b enchmarks as follows.\n2.1 General Language Models\nBene\ufb01ting from training with large scale corpus, recent LLM s have shown impressive performance\non various kind of downstream tasks, including legal tasks. Recent LLMs, trained on extensive\ncorpora, have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of downstream tasks, includ-\ning tasks in the legal domain. Proprietary LLMs, such as GPT- 4 [OpenAI, 2023b], GPT-3.5-\nTurbo [OpenAI, 2023a], PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2023], and Pa LM2 [Anil et al., 2023], exhibit\nstrong capabilities in handling legal tasks. Their impress ive performance not only demonstrates the\npotential of LLMs in addressing legal tasks but also facilit ates the low-cost, automated construc-\ntion of high-quality datasets. Concurrently, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA [Touvron et al.,\n2023a], LLaMA2 [Touvron et al., 2023b], MPT [Team, 2023], Ch atGLM 2 [Du et al., 2022], and\nBaichuan 2 [Yang et al., 2023a], are available in various mod el scales. These open-source models\nfacilitate the \ufb01ne-tuning of legal-speci\ufb01c models using ta rgeted legal datasets, potentially enhancing\nperformance.\n2.2 Legal Language Models\nThe legal language models", " Introduction\nIn the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) (Anthropic, 2023; Google, 2023; OpenAI,\n2022, 2023) have undergone rapid development, offering a glimpse into the dawn of Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence (AGI). In general, the intelligence of an LLM tends to improve as the number\nof parameters increases, allowing it to exhibit emergent capabilities across various tasks (Wei\net al., 2022). However, the improvement comes at the cost of larger computing resources for\ntraining and a potential decrease in inference throughput. These constraints present significant\nchallenges that impede the widespread adoption and utilization of LLMs. In order to tackle this\nproblem, we introduce DeepSeek-V2, a strong open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language\nmodel, characterized by economical training and efficient inference through an innovative\nTransformer architecture. It is equipped with a total of 236B parameters, of which 21B are\nactivated for each token, and supports a context length of 128K tokens.\nWe optimize the attention modules and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) within the Trans-\nformer framework (Vaswani et al., 2017) with our proposed Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)\nand DeepSeekMoE . (1) In the context of attention mechanisms, the Key-Value (KV) cache\nof the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) (Vaswani et al., 2017) poses a significant obstacle to the\ninference efficiency of LLMs. Various approaches have been explored to address this issue,\nincluding Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023) and Multi-Query Attention\n(MQA) (Shazeer, 2019). However, these Results\nEvaluations on Standard Benchmarks. Initially, we evaluate DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) and\nDeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) on standard benchmarks. Notably, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) demon-\nstrates substantial improvements in GSM8K, MATH, and HumanEval evaluations compared\nwith its base version. This progress can be attributed to the inclusion of our SFT data, which\ncomprises a considerable volume of math and code related content. In addition, DeepSeek-V2\nChat (RL) further boosts the performance on math and code benchmarks. We show more code\nand math evaluations in Discussion About Pre-Training Data Debiasing\nDuring pre-training data preparation, we identify and filter out contentious content, such as\nvalues influenced by regional cultures, to avoid our model exhibiting unnecessary subjective\nbiases on these controversial topics. Consequently, we observe that DeepSeek-V2 performs\nslightly worse on the test sets that are closely associated with specific regional cultures. For\nexample, when evaluated on MMLU, although DeepSeek-V2 achieves comparable or superior\nperformance on the majority of testsets compared with its competitors like Mixtral 8x22B, it still\nlags behind on the Humanity-Moral subset, which is mainly associated with American values.\nFurther, we conduct a manual analysis on this subset. Three well-educated human annotators\nconduct independent annotations on 420 moral scenarios from the MMLU Humanity-Moral\nsubset. Then, we compute the agreement among their annotations and the ground-truth label. As\nshown in Table 10, three human annotators and the ground-truth label exhibit a low agreement\nwith each other. Therefore, we attribute the abnormal performance of DeepSeek-V2 on these\nvalue-sensitive test sets to our efforts in debiasing the pre-training corpus.\nF. Additional Evaluations on Math and Code\nThe evaluation employs the SC-Math6 corpus, which consists of thousands of Chinese math\nproblems. DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) outperforms all Chinese LLMs, including both open-source\nand close-source models.\nWe further share more Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work\nIn this paper, we introduce DeepSeek-V2, a large MoE language model that supports 128K\ncontext length. In addition to strong performance, it is also characterized by economical\ntraining and", " INTRODUCTION\nLarge language models represent a significant milestone in the de-\nvelopment of general artificial intelligence [ 17,19,78]. While these\nmodels have demonstrated unprecedented performance across var-\nious general tasks, they still face a series of challenges, including\nissues such as hallucination [ 10,33], instruction following [ 7,58],\nand handling long contexts [ 2,8]. Many of these challenges can be\ntraced back to the inherent limitations of LLMs, with three critical\nboundaries deserving attention.\n\u2022Knowledge boundary . LLMs are constrained by their knowl-\nedge capacity. Due to finite model parameters, they cannot fully\ninternalize the vast body of world knowledge. Moreover, the inter-\nnal knowledge of LLMs is static and difficult to be updated with\nthe dynamically evolving world. Furthermore, LLMs are predomi-\nnantly trained on publicly available, high-frequency data, which\nmay result in inaccuracies when dealing with domain-specific or\nlong-tail knowledge.\n\u2022Memory boundary . LLMs also grapple with severe limitations\nin memory, primarily due to restrictions on context length. While\nadvances have been continually made in expanding the maximum\ncontext length, it still falls short of achieving the goal of lifelong\nengagement with human users. Additionally, both the training and\ndeployment of LLMs with extended context can be prohibitively\ncomputationally and storage-intensive, making it impractical to\nsignificantly expand their memory.\n\u2022Capability boundary . LLMs\u2019 capabilities are constrained\nin terms of action and autonomy. Firstly, they are limited to the\n\u2019language space\u2019 and cannot meaningfully interact with the physical\nworld. Secondly, these models heavily rely on human guidance,\nrequiring clear user instructions and appropriate demonstration\nexamples to perform specific tasks effectively.arXiv:2310.07554v2  [cs.IR]  25 Oct 2023Conference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhang and Xiao, et al.\nThe above inherent boundaries cannot be effectively addressed\nby by LLMs alone. To overcome these limitations, external assis-\ntance is sought through the process known as retrieval-augmented\ngeneration [ 15,27,32,41]. Retrievers play a crucial role in con-\nnecting LLMs with the necessary external components, enabling\nLLMs to accomplish various downstream tasks (see Figure 1). In this\ncontext, several common types of retrievers have been designed,\neach tailored to fulfill a distinct role in enhancing LLMs:\n\u2022Knowledge Retriever : providing external knowledge to sup-\nport LLMs in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks [37, 41, 59].\n\u2022Memory Retriever : collecting information that extends be-\nyond the immediate context, assisting in the generation of lengthy\nsequences [12, 71, 85].\n\u2022Tool Retriever : selecting appropriate tools, allowing LLMs to\ninteract effectively with the physical world [61, 62, 74].\n\u2022Example Retriever : locating pre-cached demonstration ex-\namples, from which LLM prompts can be automatically generated\nto facilitate in-context learning [47, 83].\nGiven the importance to connect LLMs with the external world,\nit is imperative to optimize the performance across various tasks.\nThe effectiveness of retrieval systems heavily rely on the qual-\nity of embeddings [ 30,37,68,92]. Consequently, the optimization\nchallenge centers around the learning of embedding model. His-\ntorically, two common approaches have been employed. The first\napproach focuses on developing task-specific models, where the\nembeddings are tailored for specific applications, such as question\nanswering [ 96] or in-context learning [ 83]. While this approach\nleads to a competitive performance within each scenario, it lacks\nthe versatility across different contexts. In contrast, the second\napproach resorts to general-purpose embedding models [ 59,60],\nwhich aim to be universally applicable [ 30,82,89]. However, these results. experiments are based on the Chat fine-tuned model, we\nomit the few-shot examples on MMLU.

In that work, Vaswani et al.demonstrated\nthat an Encoder-Decoder architecture combined with an Atte ntion Mechanism\ncan increase the performance of Language Models in several t asks, compared to\nrecurrent models such as LSTM [8]. Over the past few years, th ere has been a sig-\nni\ufb01cant development of transformer-based language model a rchitectures, which\nare commonly known as Large Language Models (LLM). Its deplo yment sparked\na tremendous interest and exploration in numerous domains, including chatbots2 A. Pe\u00f1a, A. Morales, J. Fierrez, et al.\n(e.g., ChatGPT,3Bard,4or Claude5), content generation [2,16], virtual AI as-\nsistants (e.g., JARVIS [20], or GitHub\u2019s Copilot6), and other language-based\ntasks [9][10][11]. These models address scalability chall enges while providing sig-\nni\ufb01cant language understanding and generation abilities. That deployment of\nlarge language models has propelled advancements in conver sational AI, au-\ntomated content creation, and improved language understan ding across vari-\nous applications, shaping a new landscape of NLP research an d development.\nThere are even voices raising the possibility that most rece nt foundational mod-\nels [1][12][13][21] may be a \ufb01rst step of an arti\ufb01cial genera l intelligence [3].\nLarge language models have the potential to greatly enhance the analysis\nof public a\ufb00airs documents. These models can e\ufb00ectively pro cess and under-\nstand the complex language used in such documents. By levera ging their vast\nknowledge and contextual understanding, large language mo dels can help to ex-\ntract key information, identify relevant topics, and perfo rm sentiment analysis\nwithin these documents. They can assist in summarizing leng thy texts, catego-\nrizing them into speci\ufb01c themes or subject areas, and identi fying relationships\nand patterns between di\ufb00erent documents. Additionally, th ese models can aid\nin identifying in\ufb02uential stakeholders, tracking changes in public sentiment over\ntime, and detecting emerging trends or issues within the dom ain of public a\ufb00airs.\nBy leveraging the power of large language models, organizat ions and policymak-\ners can gain valuable insights from public a\ufb00airs documents , enabling informed\ndecision-making, policy formulation, and e\ufb00ective commun ication strategies. The\nanalysis of public a\ufb00airs documents is also important for ci tizens as it promotes\ntransparency, accountability, and informed decision-mak ing.\nPublic a\ufb00airs documents often cover a wide range of topics, i ncluding policy\nissues, legislative updates, government initiatives, soc ial programs, and public\nopinion. These documents can address various aspects of pub lic administration,\ngovernance, and societal concerns. The automatic analysis of public a\ufb00airs text\ncan be considered a multi-label classi\ufb01cation problem. Mul ti-label classi\ufb01cation\nenables the categorization of these documents into multipl e relevant topics, al-\nlowing for a more nuanced understanding of their content. By employing multi-\nlabel classi\ufb01cation techniques, such as text categorizati on algorithms, public af-\nfairs documents can be accurately labeled with multiple att ributes, facilitating\ne\ufb03cient information retrieval, analysis, and decision-ma king processes in the\n\ufb01eld of public a\ufb00airs.\nThis work focuses on NLP-related developments in an ongoing research project.\nThe project aims to improve the automatic analysis of public a\ufb00airs documents\nusing recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis (DLA ) and Language\nTechnologies.

Retrieved from https://ii.library.jhu.edu/2023/01/30/chatgpt-a-brief- Background and Related Works\nThe architecture known as GPT , initially introduced by OpenAI in 2018, serves as the basis for ChatGPT . The \ufb01rst\nversion, GPT-1, had 117 million parameters to work with and was trained on a vast amount of text data obtained\nfrom the internet by utilizing a deep learning technique known as transformers. GPT-2, released in February 2019,\nimproved substantially and had 1.5 billion parameters. OpenAI decided not to make the full version of GPT-2\navailable (only 8% of the original model\u2019s size) to the public because of worries surrounding the model\u2019s potential for\ninappropriate use [5]. GPT-3 was released with 175 billion parameters in June 2020, with a waitlist removed later in\nNovember 2021. It had advanced to version 3.5 by the time ChatGPT went public in November 2022. In March 2023,\nOpenAI made GPT-4 available to users who signed up for the waitlist and ChatGPT Plus subscribers in a limited text-\nonly capacity. Nonetheless, it can respond to both text and images. Despite limited availability, GPT-4 has garnered\nattention for its improved performance compared to its predecessor. The reason for its superior performance over\nGPT-3.5 is that it has a larger model with more parameters tweaked during training in a neural network. To date\n(as of April 2023), OpenAI has not provided any information regarding the data, computing resources, or training\ntechniques used to develop the language model [6]. OpenAI plans to release GPT-5 in November 2023.\nBoth theoretical and empirical studies have contributed to the development of ChatGPT . While empirical studies\nmay be more prevalent in the literature, theoretical studies have also played a crucial role in advancing the \ufb01eld\nof natural language processing and deep learning. The theoretical aspect of ChatGPT development involves the\ndevelopment of the underlying mathematical and computational models that enable the model to learn and generate\nhuman-like language. Numerous large language models have been developed in recent years, such as Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, ChatGPT , and BLOOM [7]. With the help of a single pre-\ntraining and \ufb01ne-tuning pipeline, all of these transformer-based models can complete a variety of natural language\nprocessing tasks [8]. These advancements o\ufb00er signi\ufb01cant potential in research and industrial contexts, and future\ndevelopments are expected to lead to even more improved capabilities [9].\nOn the other hand, empirical studies of ChatGPT involve testing the model\u2019s performance in various NLP tasks,\nsuch as text generation, question answering, and language translation. A recent (March 2023) technical report\npublished by Open AI on GPT-4 showed that the post-learning alignment process, a pre-trained Transformer-based\nlanguage model, improved factuality and alignment with desired behavior and enables GPT-4 to perform at a\n2Preprint accepted in IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS) 2023\nhuman level on various professional and academic benchmarks, such as a simulated bar exam [10]. There are\nmany publications that study di\ufb00erent aspects of ChatGPT , and we will review some of them in the next section\nsummarizing the main applications, opportunities, and threats of ChatGPT . This study sheds light on how ChatGPT\ncan be used in di\ufb00erent domains for the greater good while minimizing potential harm and how society can", " Introduction\nThe advent of instruction-following large lan-\nguage models (LLMs), representative by Chat-\nGPT(OpenAI, 2022), has generated signi\ufb01cant in-\nterest due to their exceptional performance in un-\nderstanding instructions and generating human-like\nresponses. Compared to smaller models, LLMs\nexhibit strong generalization across various natu-\nral language processing (NLP) tasks and unique\nemergent ability to solving unseen or complicated\ntasks.

Additionally, LLMs\nare typically trained in English, constraining their\ncomprehension and response capabilities in lan-\nguages that differ signi\ufb01cantly from English, such\nas Chinese, rendering their direct application in\nChinese contexts less than ideal.\nIn this paper, we present the HuaTuo ( \u534e\u9a7c)\nmodel, an LLM tailored for the biomedical do-\nmain, focusing on the Chinese language. By gen-\nerating diverse instruction data based on medical\nknowledge from CMeKG, we emphasize ensuring\nthe correctness of facts in the model\u2019s responses,\nwhich is vital in the biomedical domain. Through\nthis process, we collect over 8,000 instruction\ndata for supervised \ufb01ne-tuning.

Our mitigations and processes alter GPT-4\u2019s behavior and prevent certain\nkinds of misuses, though they have limitations, pointing to the need for anticipatory planning and\ngovernance[ 11] and further safety research. Our approach to deployment balances minimizing risk\nfrom deployment, enabling positive use cases, and learning from deployment.\nGPT models are often trained in two stages. First, they are trained, using a large dataset of text\nfrom the Internet, to predict the next word. The models are then \ufb01ne-tuned with additional data,\nusing an algorithm called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to produce outputs\nthat are preferred by human labelers.[ 10,12,13] Training language models on large text datasets\nhas given rise to capabilities such as few-shot learning[ 10] and the ability to carry out a wide range\nof natural language tasks spanning di\ufb00erent domains, including question answering, arithmetic, and\nclassi\ufb01cation. Fine-tuning has made these models more controllable and useful.\n1.1 Overview of \ufb01ndings and mitigations\nIn this system card,1we outline the safety challenges that arise from GPT-4, and explain the\ninterventions we implemented to mitigate potential harms from its deployment. We focus on safety\nchallenges not because they necessarily outweigh the potential bene\ufb01ts,2but because we wish to\nmotivate further work in safety measurement, mitigation, and assurance. The scope of this system\ncard is narrower than the potential scope of abilities GPT-4 can be used to unlock; notably, both\ncustom \ufb01ne-tuning and image capabilities are explicitly out of scope.\nWe focus on analyzing two versions of the model: an early version \ufb01ne-tuned for instruction\nfollowing (\u201cGPT-4-early\u201d); and a version \ufb01ne-tuned for increased helpfulness and harmlessness[ 18]\nthat re\ufb02ects the further mitigations outlined in this system card (\u201cGPT-4-launch\u201d).3When we\ndiscuss the risks of GPT-4 we will often refer to the behavior of GPT-4-early, because it re\ufb02ects the\nrisks of GPT-4 when minimal safety mitigations are applied. In most cases, GPT-4-launch exhibits\nmuch safer behavior due to the safety mitigations we applied.\nKnown risks associated with smaller language models are also present with GPT-4. GPT-4\ncan generate potentially harmful content, such as advice on planning attacks or hate speech. It\ncan represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the users\nintent,4or of widely shared values. It can also generate code that is compromised or vulnerable.\nThe additional capabilities of GPT-4 also lead to new risk surfaces.\nTo understand the extent of these risks, we engaged more than 50 experts to help us gain a more\nrobust understanding of the GPT-4 model and potential deployment risks. We selected these areas\n1This document takes inspiration from the concepts of model cards and system cards.[ 14,15,16] This document\noften takes the system level of analysis, with that system including non-model mitigations such as use policies, access\ncontrols, and", " Introduction\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\nproperties \ufb01rst appeared when scaling models to a\nsuf\ufb01cient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\n\u0003Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llamaperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we \ufb01nd\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\nresulting models, called LLaMA , ranges from 7B\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\nmarks, despite being 10 \u0002smaller. We believe that\nthis model will help democratize the access and\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\navailable or undocumented (e.g. \u201cBooks \u2013 2TB\u201d or\n\u201cSocial media conversations\u201d).

We blank out text spans\n(green part) and generate them autoregressively. (Some\nattention edges are omitted; cf. Figure 2.)\nIn general, existing pretraining frameworks can\nbe categorized into three families: autoregressive ,\nautoencoding , and encoder-decoder models. Au-\ntoregressive models, such as GPT (Radford et al.,\n2018a), learn left-to-right language models. While\nthey succeed in long-text generation and show few-\nshot learning ability when scaled to billions of\nparameters (Radford et al., 2018b; Brown et al.,\n2020), the inherent disadvantage is the unidirec-\ntional attention mechanism, which cannot fully cap-\nture the dependencies between the context words\nin NLU tasks. Autoencoding models, such as\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), learn bidirectional con-\ntext encoders via denoising objectives, e.g. Masked\nLanguage Model (MLM). The encoders produce\ncontextualized representations that suit natural lan-\nguage understanding tasks, but could not be directly\napplied for text generation. Encoder-decoder mod-\nels adopt bidirectional attention for the encoder,\nunidirectional attention for the decoder, and cross\nattention between them (Song et al., 2019; Bi et al.,\n2020; Lewis et al., 2019). They are typically de-\nployed in conditional generation tasks, such as\ntext summarization and response generation.2.\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) uni\ufb01es NLU and condi-\ntional generation via encoder-decoder models but\nrequires more parameters to match the performance\n2Unconditional generation refers to generating text as a lan-\nguage model without \ufb01netuning, while conditional generation\nrefers to sequence-to-sequence tasks.arXiv:2103.10360v2  [cs.CL]  17 Mar 2022of BRET-based models such as RoBERTa (Liu\net al., 2019) and DeBERTa (He et al., 2021).\nNone of these pretraining frameworks is \ufb02exible\nenough to perform competitively across all NLP\ntasks. Previous works have tried to unify differ-\nent frameworks by combining their objectives via\nmulti-task learning (Dong et al., 2019; Bao et al.,\n2020). However, since the autoencoding and au-\ntoregressive objectives differ by nature, a simple\nuni\ufb01cation cannot fully inherit the advantages of\nboth frameworks.\nIn this paper, we propose a pretraining frame-\nwork named GLM (General Language Model),\nbased on autoregressive blank in\ufb01lling. We ran-\ndomly blank out continuous spans of tokens from\nthe input text, following the idea of autoencoding,\nand train the model to sequentially reconstruct the\nspans, following the idea of autoregressive pretrain-\ning (see Figure 1). While blanking \ufb01lling has been\nused in T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) for text-to-text pre-\ntraining, we propose two improvements, namely\nspan shuf\ufb02ing and 2D positional encoding. Empiri-\ncally, we show that with the same amount of param-\neters and computational cost, GLM signi\ufb01cantly\noutperforms BERT on the SuperGLUE benchmark\nby a large margin of 4.6% \u2013 5.0% and outperforms\nRoBERTa and BART when pretrained on a corpus\nof similar size (158GB).

Different from the BERT-\nbased models used by PET, GLM can naturally\nhandle multi-token", " Introduction\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\n\ufb02exible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),"], "bleu": 0.0, "rouge_l": 0.3094496365524403, "gpt_metric_score": 0.4, "bert_score": 0.21017234027385712}

A well-defined framework for data classification can lead to improved security practices, enabling organizations to protect sensitive information more effectively. This research could advance knowledge in information security by providing insights into user behavior and the effectiveness of various classification techniques, ultimately leading to practical applications that enhance data governance and risk management.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of accurately classifying diverse data types across various organizational contexts, the dynamic nature of data, and the need for user-friendly tools that can be integrated into existing workflows. Naive approaches may fail due to the inability to account for the context in which data is used, leading to misclassification and potential security risks. Additionally, technical obstacles such as the development of robust algorithms for automated classification and the need for comprehensive datasets for training these algorithms complicate the solution.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on specific aspects of data classification without providing a holistic framework that considers user behavior, organizational context, and evolving data landscapes. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of adaptability to different environments and insufficient emphasis on user engagement and education. Barriers such as the rapid pace of technological change and the complexity of integrating classification systems into existing IT infrastructures have also hindered progress. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by incorporating user-centered design principles and leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to create a more effective and adaptable classification system.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a machine learning-based framework for data classification that utilizes a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. We will use a diverse dataset that includes various types of organizational data, ensuring a comprehensive training process. The evaluation metric will focus on classification accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the effectiveness of our approach. Expected outcomes include a robust classification tool that enhances data governance, reduces the risk of data breaches, and improves compliance with regulatory requirements, ultimately leading to a more secure organizational environment.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: How can we develop a comprehensive framework that integrates federated learning with dynamic trust-based privacy mechanisms specifically tailored for large language models (LLMs) in healthcare?\n\n[Question 2]: This research is significant because it addresses the critical need for secure and ethical data sharing in healthcare, where sensitive patient information is often siloed within institutions. By solving this problem, we can enhance collaborative efforts in training LLMs that can lead to improved diagnostic tools, personalized treatment plans, and overall better patient outcomes. Furthermore, addressing this issue will not only advance the research community's understanding of federated learning in high-stakes environments but will also set a precedent for responsible AI applications in healthcare. The implications of this work extend beyond academia, potentially influencing policy-making and establishing ethical standards in medical AI deployments.\n\n[Question 3]: The complexity of this problem arises from the need to balance privacy and collaboration. Traditional federated learning methods may not adequately account for the dynamic trust levels of participating institutions, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Additionally, naive approaches that merely aggregate data without considering individual institution trustworthiness may result in biased models or ethical breaches. Overcoming these challenges requires a deep understanding of both machine learning techniques and privacy-preserving technologies, as well as the ability to dynamically assess and integrate trust metrics during the training process.\n\n[Question 4]: Previous research has primarily focused on either federated learning or privacy mechanisms in isolation, often neglecting the integration of trust dynamics in collaborative environments. Many existing solutions fail to address the unique challenges posed by healthcare data, such as regulatory compliance and ethical considerations. Barriers such as institutional reluctance to share sensitive data and the lack of robust frameworks that can dynamically adapt to varying trust levels have prevented this problem from being effectively solved. Our approach differs by explicitly incorporating trust assessment into the federated learning process, thus creating a more holistic and adaptable framework for healthcare applications.\n\n[Question 5]: Our proposed methodology involves developing an integrated framework that utilizes federated learning algorithms in conjunction with dynamic trust-based privacy mechanisms. We will employ a combination of real-world healthcare datasets and simulated environments to evaluate our framework's effectiveness. Key metrics for success will include model accuracy, privacy preservation (measured through differential privacy metrics), and the robustness of trust assessments. Expected outcomes include a validated framework that not only enhances the performance of LLMs in healthcare but also ensures compliance with ethical standards and patient confidentiality, thereby fostering a more secure collaborative landscape for medical AI applications.", "referenced_intros": [" Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in\ncomplex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of \ufb01elds, including in specialized\ndomains such as programming and creative writing.

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the \ufb01eld of LLMs.\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Ho\ufb00mann et al.,\n2022) rede\ufb01ned those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights.

A parallel discourse has unfolded around the", " Introduction\nLarge language models, also known as LLMs, have become an increasingly prevalent part of our\nday-to-day lives, with their use extending to a wide range of domains including web browsing, voice\nassistants, and coding assistance tools.[ 1,2,3,4] These models have the potential to signi\ufb01cantly\nimpact society in numerous ways.[ 5,6,7] This system card analyzes GPT-4, the latest large language\nmodel in the GPT family of models.[ 8,9,10] Since it \ufb01nished training in August of 2022, we have\nbeen evaluating, adversarially testing, and iteratively improving the model and the system-level\nmitigations around it. Our mitigations and processes alter GPT-4\u2019s behavior and prevent certain\nkinds of misuses, though they have limitations, pointing to the need for anticipatory planning and\ngovernance[ 11] and further safety research. Our approach to deployment balances minimizing risk\nfrom deployment, enabling positive use cases, and learning from deployment.\nGPT models are often trained in two stages. First, they are trained, using a large dataset of text\nfrom the Internet, to predict the next word. The models are then \ufb01ne-tuned with additional data,\nusing an algorithm called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to produce outputs\nthat are preferred by human labelers.[ 10,12,13] Training language models on large text datasets\nhas given rise to capabilities such as few-shot learning[ 10] and the ability to carry out a wide range\nof natural language tasks spanning di\ufb00erent domains, including question answering, arithmetic, and\nclassi\ufb01cation. Fine-tuning has made these models more controllable and useful.\n1.1 Overview of \ufb01ndings and mitigations\nIn this system card,1we outline the safety challenges that arise from GPT-4, and explain the\ninterventions we implemented to mitigate potential harms from its deployment. We focus on safety\nchallenges not because they necessarily outweigh the potential bene\ufb01ts,2but because we wish to\nmotivate further work in safety measurement, mitigation, and assurance. The scope of this system\ncard is narrower than the potential scope of abilities GPT-4 can be used to unlock; notably, both\ncustom \ufb01ne-tuning and image capabilities are explicitly out of scope.\nWe focus on analyzing two versions of the model: an early version \ufb01ne-tuned for instruction\nfollowing (\u201cGPT-4-early\u201d); and a version \ufb01ne-tuned for increased helpfulness and harmlessness[ 18]\nthat re\ufb02ects the further mitigations outlined in this system card (\u201cGPT-4-launch\u201d).3When we\ndiscuss the risks of GPT-4 we will often refer to the behavior of GPT-4-early, because it re\ufb02ects the\nrisks of GPT-4 when minimal safety mitigations are applied. In most cases, GPT-4-launch exhibits\nmuch safer behavior due to the safety mitigations we applied.\nKnown risks associated with smaller language models are also present with GPT-4. GPT-4\ncan generate potentially harmful content, such as advice on planning attacks or hate speech. It\ncan represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the users\nintent,4or of widely shared values. It can also generate code that is compromised or vulnerable.\nThe additional capabilities of GPT-4 also lead to new risk surfaces.\nTo understand the extent of these risks, we engaged more than 50 experts to help us gain a more\nrobust understanding of the GPT-4 model and potential deployment risks. We selected these areas\n1This document takes inspiration from the concepts of model cards and system cards.[ 14,15,16] This document\noften takes the system level of analysis, with that system including non-model mitigations such as use policies, access\ncontrols, and", " Introduction\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\nproperties \ufb01rst appeared when scaling models to a\nsuf\ufb01cient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\n\u0003Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llamaperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we \ufb01nd\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\nresulting models, called LLaMA , ranges from 7B\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\nmarks, despite being 10 \u0002smaller. We believe that\nthis model will help democratize the access and\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\navailable or undocumented (e.g. \u201cBooks \u2013 2TB\u201d or\n\u201cSocial media conversations\u201d).

Despite recent advances in trans-\nlation quality for a handful of language pairs and\ndomains, MT systems still perform poorly on low-\nresource languages , i.e. languages without a lot of\ntraining data.

As a result, the \ufb01eld has been\nshifting focus towards low-resource languages.\nOver the past decade, the research community\nhas made a lot of recent progress on models for low-\nresource machine translation. Approaches like iter-\native backtranslation (Sennrich et al., 2015), multi-\nlingual machine translation (Johnson et al., 2016;\nTang et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020), and even unsu-\npervised machine translation (Lample et al., 2018;\nArtetxe et al., 2018) have shown promising results are computed using the\nM2M-124 615M model.\nbetween any pair of languages, pivoting through\nEnglish is also possible. Pivoting works by \ufb01rst\ntranslating from language X into English, then from\nEnglish to language Y , instead of translating from\nX to Y . FLORES -101 supports the evaluation and\ncomparison of these strategies. Unlike previous\nwork such as Fan et al. (2020), which was unable\nto evaluate all directions of their many-to-many\nmodel, FLORES -101 enables evaluation of all 101\nx 101 pairs.\nIn Figure 10, we compare direct translation with\nEnglish-Centric Pivoting for 10 Indic languages:\nAssamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi,\nNepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sinhala, and Urdu. ThespBLEU difference between direct translation and\nEnglish pivoting is displayed in the heatmap. Over-\nall, we see gains through 80% of the directions\nby translating directly in a many-to-many fash-\nion. Some directions have gains of more than 3\nspBLEU, while a majority of the quality decrease\nfrom pivoting is less than 1 spBLEU.\ntSNE of Model Embeddings. We examine the\nsimilarity of various languages by visualizing the\ntSNE of language embedding of the trained M2M-\n124 615M model. Unlike spectral clustering, this\nexamination is a re\ufb02ection of the model embed-\ndings, rather than the spBLEU score. Figure 11\nshows that the languages belonging to the same\nlanguage family are often grouped together, clus-\ntered next to each other.Figure 11: tSNE plot of Language Embeddings. We embed the data of various languages with our model and examine by\nlanguage subgrouping. Oftentimes, languages in the same subgrouping cluster together. methods and algorithms must be devel-\noped to improve translation of these languages. In\nthis work, we create and open-source FLORES -101 ,\nan evaluation benchmark covering 101 languages.\nFLORES -101 supports many-to-many evalua-\ntion, meaning any of 10,100 language directions\ncan be evaluated. With rich metadata, it also\nsupports multimodal translation via images, and\ndocument-level translation. Unlike many other\nmultilingual datasets, FLORES -101 is fully trans-\nlated by humans using a detailed process with nu-\nmerous quality control checks, including human\nevaluation during dataset creation.\nBeyond translation, FLORES -101 can be used\nto evaluate tasks such as sentence and document\nclassi\ufb01cation, language identi\ufb01cation, and multilin-\ngual domain adaptation. We hope that the release\nof this dataset and our baseline M2M models will\nbe useful for the community.\nWe hope to continue to expand the number of\nlanguages covered", " Introduction\nPretraining large (masked) language models such\nas BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) over domain spe-\nci\ufb01c corpora has yielded consistent performance\ngains across a broad range of tasks. In biomedical\nNLP, this has often meant pretraining models over\ncollections of Electronic Health Records (EHRs)\n(Alsentzer et al., 2019). For example, Huang et al.\n(2019) showed that pretraining models over EHR\ndata improves performance on clinical predictive\ntasks. Given their empirical utility, and the fact\nthat pretraining large networks requires a nontriv-\nial amount of compute, there is a natural desire to\n?equal contribution.\n1https://github.com/elehman16/\nexposing_patient_data_release .share the model parameters for use by other re-\nsearchers in the community.\nHowever, in the context of pretraining models\nover patient EHR, this poses unique potential pri-\nvacy concerns: Might the parameters of trained\nmodels leak sensitive patient information? In the\nUnited States, the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPAA) prohibits the sharing\nof such text if it contains any reference to Pro-\ntected Health Information (PHI). If one removes\nall reference to PHI, the data is considered \u201cdei-\ndenti\ufb01ed\u201d, and is therefore legal to share.\nWhile researchers may not directly share non-\ndeidenti\ufb01ed text,2it is unclear to what extent mod-\nelspretrained on non-deidenti\ufb01ed data pose pri-\nvacy risks. Further, recent work has shown that\ngeneral purpose large language models are prone\nto memorizing sensitive information which can\nsubsequently be extracted (Carlini et al., 2020).\nIn the context of biomedical NLP, such concerns\nhave been cited as reasons for withholding direct\npublication of trained model weights (McKinney\net al., 2020). These uncertainties will continue\nto hamper dissemination of trained models among\nthe broader biomedical NLP research community,\nmotivating a need to investigate the susceptibility\nof such models to adversarial attacks.\nThis work is a \ufb01rst step towards exploring the\npotential privacy implications of sharing model\nweights induced over non-deidenti\ufb01ed EHR text.\nWe propose and run a battery of experiments are performed using\nICD-9 codes.

(2020) was re-\ncently able to extract memorized content from\nGPT-2 with up to 67% precision. This raises ques-\ntions about the risks of sharing parameters of mod-\nels trained over non-deidenti\ufb01ed data. While one\nmay mitigate concerns by attempting to remove\nPHI from datasets, no approach will be perfect\n(Beaulieu-Jones et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2020).\nFurther, deidentifying EHR data is a laborious step\nthat one may be inclined to skip for models in-\ntended for internal use. An important practical\nquestion arises in such situations: Is it safe to share\nthe trained model parameters?\nWhile prior work has investigated issues at\nthe intersection of neural networks and privacy\n(Song and Shmatikov, 2018; Salem et al., 2019;\nFredrikson et al., 2015), we are unaware of work\nthat speci\ufb01cally focuses on attacking the modernTransformer encoders widely used in NLP (e.g.,\nBERT) trained on EHR notes, an increasingly pop-\nular approach in the biomedical NLP community.\nIn a related effort, Abdalla et al.

Modern neural-network-\nbased LMs use very large model architectures (e.g., 175 bil-\nlion parameters [7]) and train on massive datasets (e.g., nearly\na terabyte of English text [55]). This scaling increases the\nability of LMs to generate \ufb02uent natural language [53,74,76],\nand also allows them to be applied to a plethora of other\ntasks [29, 39, 55], even without updating their parameters [7].\nAt the same time, machine learning models are notorious\nfor exposing information about their (potentially private) train-\ning data\u2014both in general [47, 65] and in the speci\ufb01c case of\nlanguage models [8, 45]. For instance, for certain models it\nis known that adversaries can apply membership inference\nattacks [65] to predict whether or not any particular example\nwas in the training data.\nGPT -2 East Stroudsburg Stroudsburg...

Given query access to a\nneural network language model, we extract an individual per-\nson\u2019s name, email address, phone number, fax number, and\nphysical address. The example in this \ufb01gure shows informa-\ntion that is all accurate so we redact it to protect privacy.\nSuch privacy leakage is typically associated with over\ufb01tting\n[75]\u2014when a model\u2019s training error is signi\ufb01cantly lower\nthan its test error\u2014because over\ufb01tting often indicates that a\nmodel has memorized examples from its training set. Indeed,\nover\ufb01tting is a suf\ufb01cient condition for privacy leakage [72]\nand many attacks work by exploiting over\ufb01tting [65].\nThe association between over\ufb01tting and memorization has\u2014\nerroneously\u2014led many to assume that state-of-the-art LMs\nwillnotleak information about their training data. Because\nthese models are often trained on massive de-duplicated\ndatasets only for a single epoch [7, 55], they exhibit little\nto no over\ufb01tting [53]. Accordingly, the prevailing wisdom has\nbeen that \u201cthe degree of copying with respect to any given\nwork is likely to be, at most, de minimis \u201d [71] and that models\ndo not signi\ufb01cantly memorize any particular training example.\n1arXiv:2012.07805v2  [cs.CR]  15 Jun 2021Contributions. In this work, we demonstrate that large lan-\nguage models memorize and leak individual training exam-\nples. In particular, we propose a simple and ef\ufb01cient method\nfor extracting verbatim sequences from a language model\u2019s\ntraining set using only black-box query access. Our key in-\nsight is that, although training examples do not have notice-\nably lower losses than test examples on average , certain worst-\ncase training examples are indeed memorized.\nIn our attack, we \ufb01rst generate a large, diverse set of high-\nlikelihood samples from the model, using one of three general-\npurpose sampling strategies. We then sort each sample using\none of six different metrics that estimate the likelihood of\neach sample using a separate reference model (e.g., another\nLM), and rank highest the samples with an abnormally high\nlikelihood ratio between the two models.\nOur attacks directly apply to any language model, including\nthose trained on sensitive and non-public data [10,16]. We use\nthe GPT-2 model [54] released by OpenAI as a representative\nlanguage model in our experiments, larger language models consistently memorized\nmore training data than smaller LMs. For example, in one\nsetting the 1:5billion parameter GPT-2 model memorizes\nover 18\u0002as much content as", " Introduction\nThe task of style transfer on text data involves\nchanging the style of a given sentence while pre-\nserving its semantics.1Recent work in this area\ncon\ufb02ates style transfer with the related task of\nattribute transfer (Subramanian et al., 2019; He\net al., 2020), in which modi\ufb01cations to attribute-\nspeci\ufb01c content words (e.g., those that carry senti-\nment) warp both stylistic andsemantic properties\nof a sentence (Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2016). At-\ntribute transfer has been criticized for its limited\nreal-world applications: Pang (2019) argue that se-\n1We use the quasi-paraphrase de\ufb01nition of semantic equiv-\nalence from Bhagat and Hovy (2013) throughout this paper.\nWe loosely de\ufb01ne style as patterns in lexical and syntactic\nchoice within the space of quasi-paraphrases.\nWhy,  uncle, \u2019tis a shameNo lie\u2026 I would jump in\nWhy,  uncle, \u2019tis a shameNo lie\u2026 I would jump inO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?it\u2019s a shame, uncleI\u2019d jump in there, no doubtOh, you\u2019re gonna leave me unsatisfied, right?Ooh yall will leave me unhappy lolStep 1:  diverse paraphrasingStep 2:inverse paraphrasing (Shakespeare, Twitter)Training timeTest timeFigure 1: During training, STRAP applies a diverse\nparaphraser to an input sentence and passes the result\nthrough a style-speci\ufb01c inverse paraphraser to recon-\nstruct the input. At test time, we perform style transfer\nby swapping out different inverse paraphrase models\n(Shakespeare!Twitter shown here). All generated\nsentences shown here are actual outputs from STRAP .\nmantic preservation is critical for author obfusca-\ntion (Shetty et al., 2018), data augmentation (Xie\net al., 2019; Kaushik et al., 2020), text simpli\ufb01ca-\ntion (Xu et al., 2015), writing assistance (Heidorn,\n2000). Moreover, semantic preservation (via para-\nphrases) has several applications like better transla-\ntion evaluation (Sellam et al., 2020; Freitag et al.,\n2020) and adversarial defenses (Iyyer et al., 2018).\nWe propose to improve semantic preservation\nin style transfer by modeling the task as a con-\ntrolled paraphrase generation problem. Our unsu-\npervised method ( StyleTransfer via Paraphrasing,\norSTRAP ) requires no parallel data between differ-\nent styles and proceeds in three simple stages:\n1.Create pseudo-parallel data by feeding sen-\ntences from different styles through a diverse\nparaphrase model (Figure 1, left).\n2.Train style-speci\ufb01c inverse paraphrase mod-\nels that convert these paraphrased sentences\nback into the original stylized sentences.\n3.Use the inverse paraphraser for a desired\nstyle to perform style transfer (Figure 1, right).arXiv:2010.05700v1  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2020Our approach requires none of the \ufb01nicky2mod-\neling paradigms popular in style transfer research \u2014\nno reinforcement learning (Luo et al., 2019), vari-\national inference (He et al., 2020), or autoregres-\nsive sampling during training (Subramanian et al.,\n2019). Instead, we implement the \ufb01rst two stages\nof our pipeline by simply \ufb01ne-tuning a pretrained\nGPT-2 language model (Radford et al., 2019).\nDespite its simplicity, STRAP signi\ufb01cantly out-\nperforms the state of the art on formality transfer\nand Shakespeare author imitation datasets by 2-3x\non automatic evaluations and 4-5x on human evalu-\nations. We further show that only 3 out of 23 prior\nstyle transfer papers properly evaluate their models:\nin fact, a na \u00a8\u0131ve baseline that randomly chooses to\neither copy its input or retrieve a random sentence\nwritten in the target style outperforms prior work\non poorly-designed metrics.\nFinally, we take a step towards real-world style\ntransfer by collecting a large dataset CDS (Corpus\nofDiverse Styles) of 15M English sentences span-\nning 11 diverse styles , including the works of\nJames Joyce, romantic poetry, tweets, and conver-\nsational speech.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),", " Introduction\nResearch on arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) has enabled a va-\nriety of signi\ufb01cant breakthroughs over the course of the\nlast two decades. In digital healthcare, the introduction of\npowerful Machine Learning-based and particularly Deep\nLearning-based models [1] has led to disruptive innova-\ntions in radiology, pathology, genomics and many other\n\ufb01elds. In order to capture the complexity of these ap-\nplications, modern Deep Learning (DL) models feature a\nlarge number (e.g. millions) of parameters that are learned\nfrom and validated on medical datasets. Suf\ufb01ciently large\ncorpora of curated data are thus required in order to ob-\ntain models that yield clinical-grade accuracy, whilst be-\ning safe, fair, equitable and generalising well to unseen\ndata [2, 3, 4].\nFor example, training an automatic tumour detector and\n1arXiv:2003.08119v2  [cs.CY]  15 Jan 2021diagnostic tool in a supervised way requires a large anno-\ntated database that encompasses the full spectrum of pos-\nsible anatomies, pathological patterns and types of input\ndata. Data like this is hard to obtain and curate. One of\nthe main dif\ufb01culties is that unlike other data, which may\nbe shared and copied rather freely, health data is highly\nsensitive, subject to regulation and cannot be used for re-\nsearch without appropriate patient consent and ethical ap-\nproval [5]. Even if data anonymisation is sometimes pro-\nposed as a way to bypass these limitations, it is now well-\nunderstood that removing metadata such as patient name\nor date of birth is often not enough to preserve privacy [6].\nImaging data suffers from the same issue - it is possible to\nreconstruct a patient\u2019s face from three-dimensional imag-\ning data, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI). Also the human brain itself has\nbeen shown to be as unique as a \ufb01ngerprint [7], where\nsubject identity, age and gender can be predicted and re-\nvealed [8]. Another reason why data sharing is not sys-\ntematic in healthcare is that medical data are potentially\nhighly valuable and costly to acquire. Collecting, curating\nand maintaining a quality dataset takes considerable time\nand effort. These datasets may have a signi\ufb01cant busi-\nness value and so are not given away lightly. In practice,\nopenly sharing medical data is often restricted by data col-\nlectors themselves, who need \ufb01ne-grained control over the\naccess to the data they have gathered.\nFederated Learning (FL) [9, 10, 11] is a learning\nparadigm that seeks to address the problem of data gover-\nnance and privacy by training algorithms collaboratively\nwithout exchanging the underlying datasets. The ap-\nproach was originally developed in a different domain,\nbut it recently gained traction for healthcare applications\nbecause it neatly addresses the problems that usually ex-\nist when trying to aggregate medical data. Applied to\ndigital health this means that FL enables insights to be\ngained collaboratively across institutions, e.g. in the form\nof a global or consensus model, without sharing the pa-\ntient data. In particular, the strength of FL is that sen-\nsitive training data does not need to be moved beyond\nthe \ufb01rewalls of the institutions in which they reside. In-\nstead, the Machine Learning (ML) process occurs locally\nat each participating institution and only model charac-\nteristics (e.g. parameters, gradients etc.) are exchanged.\nOnce training has been completed, the trained consensus\nmodel bene\ufb01ts from the knowledge accumulated acrossall institutions.

We highlight the\nintuitions, key techniques as well as fundamental\nassumptions adopted by various attacks, and dis-\ncuss promising future research directions towards\nmore robust privacy preservation in FL.\n1 Introduction\nAs computing devices become increasingly ubiquitous, peo-\nple generate huge amounts of data through their day to day\nusage. Collecting such data into centralized storage facilities\nis costly and time consuming. Another important concern is\ndata privacy and user con\ufb01dentiality as the usage data usually\ncontain sensitive information [Abadi et al. , 2016 ]. Sensitive\ndata such as facial images, location-based services, or health\ninformatioon can be used for targeted social advertising and\nrecommendation, posing the immediate or potential privacy\nrisks. Hence, private data should not be directly shared\nwithout any privacy consideration. As societies become in-\ncreasingly aware of privacy preservation, legal restrictions\nsuch as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are\nemerging which makes data aggregation practices less feasi-\nble[Yang et al. , 2019b ].\nTraditional centralized machine learning (ML) cannot sup-\nport such ubiquitous deployments and applications due toTable 1: Taxonomy for horizontal federated learning (HFL).\nHFL Number of\nParticipantsFL Training\nParticipationTechnical Ca-\npability\nH2B small frequent high\nH2C large not frequent low\ninfrastructure shortcomings such as limited communication\nbandwidth, intermittent network connectivity, and strict de-\nlay constraints [Liet al. , 2018 ]. In this scenario, federated\nlearning (FL) which pushes model training to the devices\nfrom which data originate emerged as a promising alternative\nML paradigm [McMahan et al. , 2016b ]. FL enables a mul-\ntitude of participants to construct a joint ML model without\nexposing their private training data [McMahan et al. , 2016b;\nBonawitz et al. , 2017 ]. It can handle unbalanced and non-\nindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data which\nnaturally arise in the real world [McMahan et al. , 2016a ].\nIn recent years, FL has bene\ufb01ted a wide range of applica-\ntions such as next word prediction [McMahan et al. , 2016a;\nMcMahan et al. , 2018 ], visual object detection for safety [Liu\net al. , 2020 ], etc.\n1.1 Types of Federated Learning\nBased on the distribution of data features and data sam-\nples among participants, federated learning can be gener-\nally classi\ufb01ed as horizontally federated learning (HFL), verti-\ncally federated learning (VFL) and federated transfer learning\n(FTL) [Yang et al. , 2019a ].\nUnder HFL, datasets owned by each participant share sim-\nilar features but concern different users [Kantarcioglu and\nClifton, 2004 ]. In this paper, we further classify HFL into\nHFL to businesses (H2B), and HFL to consumers (H2C). A\ncomparison between H2B and H2C is listed in Table 1. The\nmain difference lies in the number of participants, FL train-\ning participation level, and technical capability, which can in-\n\ufb02uence how adversaries attempt to compromise the FL sys-\ntem. Under H2B, there are typically a handful of participants.\nThey can be frequently selected during FL training. The par-\nticipants tend to possess signi\ufb01cant computational power and\nsophisticated technical capabilities [Yang et al. , 2019b ]. Un-\nder H2C, there can be thousands or even millions of potential\nparticipants. In each round of training, only a subset of them\nare selected. As their datasets tend to be small, the chancearXiv:2003.02133v1  [cs.CR]  4 Mar 2020of", " Introduction  \nThis paper opens up new possibilities by way of a two -dimensional framework  of Human -\nCentered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) that separates  levels of automation/autonomy from levels \nof human control.  The new goal is to seek high levels  of human control AND high levels of \nautomation , which is more likely to produce computer applications  that are Reliable,  Safe & \nTrustworthy  (RST). Achieving this goal , especially for complex poorly understood problems,  \nwill dramatically increase human perform ance, while supporting human self -efficacy, mastery, \ncreativity, and responsibility.   \nThe traditional belief in  computer  autonomy is compelling for m any artificial intelligence (AI) \nresearcher s, developers, journalists, and promoters . The goal of computer  autonomy  was central \nin Sheridan and Verpl ank\u2019s (1978)  ten levels from human control to computer  \nautomation /autonomy  (Table 1) . Their widely cited  one-dimensional  list continues to guide  much \nof the research and development , suggesting that increases in au tomation must come at the cost \nof lowering human control.  Shifting to  HCA I could liberate  design thinking  so as to produce \ncomputer application s that increase automation, while amplify ing, augment ing, enhancing , and \nempower ing people to innovatively apply systems and creatively refine the m. - 2     -  \nTable 1: Summar y of the  widely cited , but mind -limiting  1-dimensional  Sheridan -Verplank levels of  \nautomation/a utonomy  (Parasuraman et al., 2000 ) \n \nSheridan & Verplank\u2019s  ten levels of automation/ autonomy have  been widely influential, but \ncritics suggested refinements such as  the four  stage s of automation : (1) information acquisition, \n(2) analysis of information, (3) decision or choice of acti on, and (4) execution of action \n(Parasuraman, Sheridan &  Wickens, 2000). These stages refine discussions of each of the levels, \nbut the underlying message is that the goal is full automation/autonomy.  \nEven Sheridan (2000) commented with concern that \u201csurprisingly, the level descriptions as \npublished have been t aken mo re seriously than were expected \u201d (see Hoffman & Johnson (2019) \nfor a detailed history ). However, i n spite of the many critiques, the  1-dimensional  levels of \nautomation/ autonomy , which only represents situations where  increased automation must come \nwith less human control , is still widely influential. For example,  the US Society of Automotive \nEngineers adopted  the unnecessary trade -off in its  six levels of  autonomy for self -driving cars  \n(SAE, 2014; Brooks , 2017) (Table 2).  \n \nLevel        Description  \n   5.

This issue appears in popular press,\nindustry practices [2, 10], regulations [24], as well as hundreds\nof recent papers published in AI and related disciplines. These\nXAI works often express an algorithm-centric view, relying\non \u201cresearchers\u2019 intuition of what constitutes a \u2018good\u2019 expla-\nnation \u201d [63]. This is problematic because AI explanations\nare often demanded by lay users, who may not have deep\ntechnical understanding of AI, but hold preconception of what\nconstitutes useful explanations for decisions made in a familiar\ndomain. As an example, one of the most popular approaches\nto explain a prediction made by a ML classi\ufb01er, as dozens\nof XAI algorithms strive to do [40], is by listing the features\nwith the highest weights contributing to a model\u2019s prediction.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the \ufb01rst page.

However, it is question-\nable whether such an explanation satis\ufb01es a doctor\u2019s needs\nto understand the AI, or adds signi\ufb01cant value to a clinical\ndecision-support tool.\nTo close the gap between XAI algorithms and user needs for\neffective transparency, the HCI community has called for in-\nterdisciplinary collaboration [4] and user-centered approaches\nto explainability [92]. This emerging area of work tends to\neither build on frameworks of human explanations from social\nscience, or empirically study how explanation features impact\nuser interaction with AI. In this paper, we take a complemen-\ntary approach by investigating challenges faced by industry\npractitioners to create explainable AI products, with the goal\nof identifying gaps between the algorithmic work of XAI and\nwhat is needed to address real-world user needs.\nRecently, an increasing number of open-source toolkits (e.g. [1,\n2, 3, 10]) are making XAI techniques, which produce various\nforms of explanation for \u201cblack-box\u201d ML models, accessible\nto practitioners. However, little is known about how to put\nthese techniques from research literature into practice. As\nwe will show, it is challenging work to bridge user needs and\ntechnical capabilities to create effective explainabilty features\nin AI products. This kind of work often falls to those with\na bridging role in product teams\u2013the design and user experi-\nence (UX) practitioners, whose job involves identifying user\nneeds, communicating with developers and stakeholders, and\ncreating design solutions based on demands and constraints\non both sides. We study, therefore, how AI explainability is\napproached by design and UX practitioners, explore together\nwith them how XAI techniques can be applied in various prod-\nucts, and identify opportunities to better support their", " Introduction\nSelf-supervised methods for corrupting\ndocuments for pre-training, perhaps tailoring them to\nspeci\ufb01c end tasks. Results on two standard summarization datasets.

To help the model better \ufb01t the\ndata, we disabled dropout for the \ufb01nal 10% of training\nsteps.

Overall, BART performs simi-\nlarly, with only small differences between the models\non most tasks. suggesting that BART\u2019s improvements\non generation tasks do not come at the expense of clas-\nsi\ufb01cation performance.\n5.3 Generation Tasks\nWe also experiment with several text generation tasks.\nBART is \ufb01ne-tuned as a standard sequence-to-sequence\nmodel from the input to the output text.

To test how well BART performs in this\nregime, and to create a useful model for downstream\ntasks, we trained BART using the same scale as the\nRoBERTa model.\n5.1 Experimental Setup\nWe pre-train a large model with 12 layers in each of the\nencoder and decoder, and a hidden size of 1024. Fol-\nlowing RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), we use a batch size\nof 8000, and train the model for 500000 steps.

For example, a historically common\napproach is to use word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013b,a; Pennington et al., 2014) to map\nword identities to a continuous representation where, ideally, similar words map to similar\nvectors. These vectors are often learned through an objective that, for example, encourages\nco-occurring words to be positioned nearby in the continuous space (Mikolov et al., 2013b).\nRecently, it has become increasingly common to pre-train the entire model on a data-rich\ntask. Ideally, this pre-training causes the model to develop general-purpose abilities and\nknowledge that can then be transferred to downstream tasks. In applications of transfer\nlearning to computer vision (Oquab et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2014; Huh et al., 2016; Yosinski\net al., 2014), pre-training is typically done via supervised learning on a large labeled data set\nlike ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2009). In contrast, modern techniques\nfor transfer learning in NLP often pre-train using unsupervised learning on unlabeled data.\nThis approach has recently been used to obtain state-of-the-art methods in natural\nlanguage processing , 2013.\nKaitao Song, Xu Tan, Tao Qin, Jianfeng Lu, and Tie-Yan Liu.

The bottom-up evolution of representations\nin the transformer: A study with machine translation and language modeling", " INTRODUCTION\nMachine learning algorithms have penetrated every aspect of our lives. Algorithms make movie\nrecommendations, suggest products to buy, and who to date. They are increasingly used in high-stakes\nscenarios such as loans [ 113] and hiring decisions [ 19,39]. There are clear benefits to algorithmic\ndecision-making; unlike people, machines do not become tired or bored [ 45,119], and can take into\naccount orders of magnitude more factors than people can. However, like people, algorithms are\nvulnerable to biases that render their decisions \u201cunfair\u201d [6, 121]. In the context of decision-making,\nfairness is the absence of any prejudice or favoritism toward an individual or group based on\ntheir inherent or acquired characteristics . Thus, an unfair algorithm is one whose decisions are\nskewed toward a particular group of people. A canonical example comes from a tool used by courts\nin the United States to make pretrial detention and release decisions. The software, Correctional\nOffender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), measures the risk of a person\nto recommit another crime. Judges use COMPAS to decide whether to release an offender, or to keep\nhim or her in prison. An investigation into the software found a bias against African-Americans:1\n1https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\nAuthors\u2019 address: USC, Information Sciences Institute 4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001 Marina del Rey, CA 90292\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Agreement\nNo. HR0011890019.arXiv:1908.09635v3  [cs.LG]  25 Jan 20222 Mehrabi et al.\nCOMPAS is more likely to have higher false positive rates for African-American offenders than\nCaucasian offenders in falsely predicting them to be at a higher risk of recommitting a crime or\nrecidivism. Similar findings have been made in other areas, such as an AI system that judges beauty\npageant winners but was biased against darker-skinned contestants,2or facial recognition software in\ndigital cameras that overpredicts Asians as blinking.3These biased predictions stem from the hidden\nor neglected biases in data or algorithms.\nIn this survey we identify two potential sources of unfairness in machine learning outcomes\u2014\nthose that arise from biases in the data and those that arise from the algorithms. We review research\ninvestigating how biases in data skew what is learned by machine learning algorithms, and nuances\nin the way the algorithms themselves work to prevent them from making fair decisions\u2014even when\nthe data is unbiased. Furthermore, we observe that biased algorithmic outcomes might impact user\nexperience, thus generating a feedback loop between data, algorithms and users that can perpetuate\nand even amplify existing sources of bias.\nWe begin the review with several highly visible real-world cases of where unfair machine learning\nalgorithms have led to suboptimal and discriminatory outcomes in Section 2. In Section 3, we\ndescribe the different types and sources of biases that occur within the data-algorithms-users loop\nmentioned above. Next, in Section 4, we present the different ways that the concept of fairness has\nbeen operationalized and studied in the literature. We discuss the ways in which these two concepts\nare coupled. Last, we will focus on different families of machine learning approaches, how fairness\nmanifests differently in each one, and the current state-of-the-art for tackling them in Section 5,\nfollowed by potential areas of future work in each of the domains in Section 6.\n2 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF ALGORITHMIC UNFAIRNESS\nWith the popularity", " Introduction\nAdversarial attacks modify inputs in order to cause\nmachine learning models to make errors (Szegedy\net al., 2014). From an attack perspective, they ex-\npose system vulnerabilities, e.g., a spammer may\nuse adversarial attacks to bypass a spam email \ufb01l-\nter (Biggio et al., 2013). These security concerns\ngrow as natural language processing (NLP) mod-\nels are deployed in production systems such as\nfake news detectors and home assistants.\nBesides exposing system vulnerabilities, adver-\nsarial attacks are useful for evaluation and in-\nterpretation, i.e., understanding a model\u2019s capa-\nbilities by \ufb01nding its limitations. For example,\nadversarially-modi\ufb01ed inputs are used to evalu-\nate reading comprehension models (Jia and Liang,2017; Ribeiro et al., 2018) and stress test neural\nmachine translation (Belinkov and Bisk, 2018).\nAdversarial attacks also facilitate interpretation,\ne.g., by analyzing a model\u2019s sensitivity to local\nperturbations (Li et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2018).\nThese attacks are typically generated for a spe-\nci\ufb01c input; are there attacks that work for anyin-\nput? We search for universal adversarial trig-\ngers: input-agnostic sequences of tokens that\ntrigger a model to produce a speci\ufb01c prediction\nwhen concatenated to any input from a dataset.\nThe existence of such triggers would have se-\ncurity implications\u2014the triggers can be widely\ndistributed and allow anyone to attack models.\nFurthermore, from an analysis perspective, input-\nagnostic attacks can provide new insights into\nglobal model behavior.\nTriggers are a new form of universal adversar-\nial perturbation (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017)\nadapted to discrete textual inputs. To \ufb01nd them,\nwe design a gradient-guided search over tokens.\nThe search iteratively updates the tokens in the\ntrigger sequence to increase the likelihood of the\ntarget prediction for batches of examples (Sec-\ntion 2). We \ufb01nd short sequences that success-\nfully trigger a target prediction when concatenated\nto inputs from text classi\ufb01cation, reading compre-\nhension, and conditional text generation.\nFor text classi\ufb01cation, triggers cause targeted\nerrors for sentiment analysis (e.g., top of Table 1)\nand natural language inference models. For exam-\nple, one word causes a model to predict 99.43% of\nEntailment examples as Contradiction (Section 3).\nFor reading comprehension, triggers are concate-\nnated to paragraphs to cause arbitrary target pre-\ndictions (Section 4). For example, models predict\nthe vicious phrase \u201cto kill american people\u201d for\nmany \u201cwhy\u201d questions (e.g., middle of Table 1).\nFor conditional text generation, triggers are\nprepended to user inputs in order to maximize\nthe likelihood of a set of target texts (Section 5).\nOur attack triggers GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)arXiv:1908.07125v3  [cs.CL]  3 Jan 2021Task Input (red= trigger) Model Prediction\nSentiment\nAnalysiszoning tapping \ufb01ennes Visually imaginative, thematically instructive and thor-\noughly delightful, it takes us on a roller-coaster ride. . .Positive!Negative\nzoning tapping \ufb01ennes As surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph,\nas visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming.Positive!Negative\nInput (underline = correct span, red= trigger, underline = target span)\nSQuADQuestion: Why did he walk?\nFor exercise , Tesla walked between 8 to 10 miles per day.

Segments usually consist of\nmore than one natural sentence. The two seg-\nments are presented as a single input sequence\nto BERT with special tokens delimiting them:\n[CLS],x1,...,x N,[SEP],y1,...,yM,[EOS].\nMandNare constrained such that M+N < T ,\nwhereTis a parameter that controls the maximum\nsequence length during training.\nThe model is \ufb01rst pretrained on a large unla-\nbeled text corpus and subsequently \ufb01netuned us-\ning end-task labeled data.\n2.2 Architecture\nBERT uses the now ubiquitous transformer archi-\ntecture ( Vaswani et al. ,2017 ), which we will not\nreview in detail. We use a transformer architecture\nwithLlayers. Each block uses Aself-attention\nheads and hidden dimension H.\n2.3 Training Objectives\nDuring pretraining, BERT uses two objectives:\nmasked language modeling and next sentence pre-\ndiction.\nMasked Language Model (MLM) A random\nsample of the tokens in the input sequence is\nselected and replaced with the special token\n[MASK]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy\nloss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uni-\nformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possi-\nble replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are\nreplaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged,and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vo-\ncabulary token.\nIn the original implementation, random mask-\ning and replacement is performed once in the be-\nginning and saved for the duration of training, al-\nthough in practice, data is duplicated so the mask\nis not always the same for every training sentence\n(see Section 4.1).\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP) NSP is a bi-\nnary classi\ufb01cation loss for predicting whether two\nsegments follow each other in the original text.\nPositive examples are created by taking consecu-\ntive sentences from the text corpus. Negative ex-\namples are created by pairing segments from dif-\nferent documents. Positive and negative examples\nare sampled with equal probability.\nThe NSP objective was designed to improve\nperformance on downstream tasks, such as Natural\nLanguage Inference ( Bowman et al. ,2015 ), which\nrequire reasoning about the relationships between\npairs of sentences.\n2.4 Optimization\nBERT is optimized with Adam ( Kingma and Ba ,\n2015 ) using the following parameters: \u03b21= 0.9,\n\u03b22= 0.999,\u01eb=1e-6 and L2weight de-\ncay of0.01. The learning rate is warmed up\nover the \ufb01rst 10,000 steps to a peak value of\n1e-4, and then linearly decayed. BERT trains\nwith a dropout of 0.1 on all layers and at-\ntention weights, and a GELU activation func-\ntion ( Hendrycks and Gimpel ,2016 ). Models are\npretrained for S=1,000,000 updates, with mini-\nbatches containing B=256 sequences of maxi-\nmum length T=512 tokens.\n2.5 Data\nBERT is trained on a combination of B OOK COR-\nPUS (Zhu et al. ,2015 ) plus English W IKIPEDIA ,\nwhich totals 16GB of uncompressed text.3\n3 Experimental Setup\nIn this section, we describe the experimental setup\nfor our replication study of BERT.\n3.1 Implementation\nWe reimplement BERT in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al. ,\n2019 ).

These large language\nmodels have the potential to generate textual out-\nput that is indistinguishable from human-written\ntext to a non-expert reader. That means that the ad-\nvances in the development of large language mod-\nels also lower the barrier for abuse.\nInstances of malicious autonomously generated\ntext at scale are rare but often high-pro\ufb01le, for in-\nstance when a simple generation system was used\nto create fake comments in opposition to net neu-\ntrality (Grimaldi, 2018). Other scenarios include\nthe possibility of generating false articles (Wang,\n2017) or misleading reviews (Fornaciari and Poe-\nsio, 2014). Forensic techniques will be necessary\nto detect this automatically generated text. These\ntechniques should be accurate, but also easy to\nconvey to non-experts and require little setup cost.\nFigure 1: The top-k overlay within GLTR.

With\nour tool, subjects were able to detect fake text\nwith an accuracy of over 72% without any prior\ntraining. By presenting this information visually,\nwe also hope the tool teaches users to notice the\nartefacts of text generation systems.\n2 Method\nConsider the generation detection task as decid-\ning whether a sequence of words ^X1:Nhave been\nwritten by a human or generated from a model. We\ndo not have supervision for this task, and instead,\nwant to use distributional properties of the under-\nlying language. In the white-box case, we are also\ngiven full access to the language model distribu-\ntion,p(XijX1:i\u00001), that was used in generation.\nIn the general case, we assume access to a different\nlearned model of the same form. This approach\ncan be contextualized in the evaluation framework\nproposed by Hashimoto et al. (2019) who \ufb01nd that\nhuman-written and generated text can be discrim-\ninated based on the model likelihood if the human\nacceptability is high.\nThe underlying assumption of our abstract (Figure 3d+e). There is a signif-\nicantly higher fraction of red and purple (e.g. non-\nobvious) predictions compared to the generated\nexample. The difference is also observable in the\nhistograms where the fraction of low-probability\nwords is higher and low-entropy contexts smaller.\n3In a shocking \ufb01nding,", " Introduction\nText classi\ufb01cation is a classic problem in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP). The task is to assign\nprede\ufb01ned categories to a given text sequence. An\nimportant intermediate step is the text representa-\ntion. Previous work uses various neural models\nto learn text representation, including convolution\nmodels (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,\n2015; Conneau et al., 2016; Johnson and Zhang,\n2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018), re-\ncurrent models (Liu et al., 2016; Yogatama et al.,\n2017; Seo et al., 2017), and attention mechanisms\n(Yang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017).\nAlternatively, substantial work has shown that\npre-trained models on large corpus are bene\ufb01cial\nfor text classi\ufb01cation and other NLP tasks, which\ncan avoid training a new model from scratch. One\nkind of pre-trained models is the word embed-\ndings, such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)\nand GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), or the con-\ntextualized word embeddings, such as CoVe (Mc-\nCann et al., 2017) and ELMo (Peters et al.,\n\u0003Corresponding author\n1The source codes are available at https://github.\ncom/xuyige/BERT4doc-Classification .2018). These word embeddings are often used\nas additional features for the main task. An-\nother kind of pre-training models is sentence-\nlevel. Howard and Ruder (2018) propose ULM-\nFiT, a \ufb01ne-tuning method for pre-trained language\nmodel that achieves state-of-the-art Related Work\nBorrowing the learned knowledge from the other\ntasks has a rising interest in the \ufb01eld of NLP. We\nbrie\ufb02y review two related approaches: language\nmodel pre-training and multi-task Learning.\n2.1 Language Model Pre-training\nPre-trained word embeddings (Mikolov et al.,\n2013; Pennington et al., 2014), as an important\ncomponent of modern NLP systems can offer sig-\nni\ufb01cant improvements over embeddings learned\nfrom scratch. The generalization of word embed-\ndings, such as sentence embeddings (Kiros et al.,\n2015; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018) or paragraph\nembeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014), are also used\nas features in downstream models.\nPeters et al. (2018) concatenate embeddings de-\nrived from language model as additional features\nfor the main task and advance the state-of-the-\nart for several major NLP benchmarks. In addi-\ntion to pre-training with unsupervised data, trans-\nfer learning with a large amount of supervised data\ncan also achieve good performance, such as natu-\nral language inference (Conneau et al., 2017) and\nmachine translation (McCann et al., 2017).\nMore recently, the method of pre-training lan-\nguage models on a large network with a large\namount of unlabeled data and \ufb01ne-tuning in down-\nstream tasks has made a breakthrough in sev-\neral natural language understanding tasks, such as\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT\n(Devlin et al., 2018). Dai and Le (2015) use lan-\nguage model \ufb01ne-tuning but over\ufb01t with 10k la-\nbeled examples while Howard and Ruder (2018)\npropose ULMFiT and achieve state-of-the-art re-\nsults in the text classi\ufb01cation task. BERT is\npre-trained on Masked Language Model Task and\nNext Sentence Prediction Task via a large cross-\ndomain corpus. Unlike previous bidirectional lan-\nguage models (biLM) limited to a combination of\ntwo unidirectional language models (i.e., left-to-\nright and right-to-left), BERT uses a Masked Lan-\nguage Model to predict words which are randomly\nmasked or replaced. BERT is the \ufb01rst \ufb01ne-tuning\nbased representation model that achieves state-of-the-art Experiments\nWe investigate the different \ufb01ne-tuning Conclusion\nIn this paper, we conduct extensive References\nRich Caruana. 1993.

Embedding has gained lot of attention and has become a part of NLP \nresearcher\u2019s toolkit.   According to distributed hypothesis [71, 72], semantic similarity between two word s can be \nexpressed in terms of their contexts (i.e.) words with similar contexts have similar meaning. Word embeddings which \nare based on distributed hypothesis, represent words as dense, low dimensional and fixed length vectors in a \ncontinuous vector spac e and make sure that words with similar meaning are nearby . A word embedding typically \nconsists of hundreds of dimensions and each dimension represents a feature. So, in word embedding the meaning \nof a word is distributed across dimensions. Word embedding is particularly suitable for deep learning models which \nconsists of   multiple layers employing matrix operations to find the high level representations of text data.  \nFor the past few decades, researchers employed machine learning approaches with  tradition al \nrepresentations like bag -of-words for NLP tasks. In one hot representation of words, a vocabulary of all the unique \nwords in the corpus is generated and each word is represented as vector of 0s and 1s where the dimension \ncorresponding to the word is set  to 1 and all others set to 0.  Bag of words feature vector of a document is the sum \nof one hot vectors of all the words and has 1 only for the words occurring in the document.  For a better \nrepresentation, 0s and 1s can be replaced with other measures lik e word frequency, tf -idf measure, N -grams etc.  All \nthese representations are high dimensional, sparse and ignore order as well as syntactic and semantic similarities of \nthe words.  \n \nPreprint submitted to Arxiv  \n \nThis paper got published in Journal of Biomedical Informatics.\nUpdated version is available @ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.1033232 \n In contrast, embedding maps the variable len gth text to dense vector representations and overcome curse \nof dimensionality and  lack of syntactic and semantic information in representations. Moreover, embeddings are \nlearned in an unsupervised manner which capture the knowledge in a large unlabeled cor pus and it can be \ntransferred to the downstream tasks with small labeled data sets.  Hence, embedding has become an unavoidable \nchoice for text representation in the recent times of deep learning era.  \n1.1 Literature Selection  \n       We collected papers fro m various sources like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, ACL Web Anthology, \nand AAAI .We confined to the papers which are published in the period January 2014 to Nov 2018  because of the \nrecent popularity of embeddings .

(b) We transfer attributes by removing mark-\ners of the original attribute, then generating a new\nsentence conditioned on the remaining words and\nthe target attribute.\net al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018). In\neach of these cases, the goal is to convert a sen-\ntence with one attribute (e.g., negative sentiment)\nto one with a different attribute (e.g., positive sen-\ntiment), while preserving all attribute-independent\ncontent1(e.g., what properties of a restaurant are\nbeing discussed). Typically, aligned sentences\nwith the same content but different attributes are\nnot available; systems must learn to disentangle\nattributes and content given only unaligned sen-\n1Henceforth, we refer to attribute-independent content as\nsimply content , for simplicity.arXiv:1804.06437v1  [cs.CL]  17 Apr 2018tences labeled with attributes.\nPrevious work has attempted to use adversarial\nnetworks (Shen et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018) for\nthis task, but\u2014as we demonstrate\u2014their outputs\ntend to be low-quality, as judged by human raters.\nThese models are also dif\ufb01cult to train (Salimans\net al., 2016; Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017; Bous-\nmalis et al., 2017).\nIn this work, we propose a set of simpler, easier-\nto-train systems that leverage an important ob-\nservation: attribute transfer can often be accom-\nplished by changing a few attribute markers \u2014\nwords or phrases in the sentence that are indicative\nof a particular attribute\u2014while leaving the rest of\nthe sentence largely unchanged. Figure 1 shows an\nexample in which the sentiment of a sentence can\nbe altered by changing a few sentiment-speci\ufb01c\nphrases but keeping other words \ufb01xed.\nWith this intuition, we \ufb01rst propose a simple\nbaseline that already outperforms prior adversarial\napproaches. Consider a sentiment transfer (nega-\ntive to positive) task. First, from unaligned cor-\npora of positive and negative sentences, we iden-\ntify attribute markers by \ufb01nding phrases that oc-\ncur much more often within sentences of one at-\ntribute than the other (e.g., \u201cworst\u201d and \u201cvery\ndisppointed\u201d are negative markers). Second, given\na sentence, we delete any negative markers in it,\nand regard the remaining words as its content.\nThird, we retrieve a sentence with similar content\nfrom the positive corpus.\nWe further improve upon this baseline by in-\ncorporating a neural generative model, as shown\nin Figure 1. Our neural system extracts content\nwords in the same way as our baseline, then gen-\nerates the \ufb01nal output with an RNN decoder that\nconditions on the extracted content and the target\nattribute. This approach has signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts at\ntraining time, compared to adversarial networks:\nhaving already separated content and attribute, we\nsimply train our neural model to reconstruct sen-\ntences in the training data as an", " Introduction\nWhen a secret is shared, it can be very dif\ufb01cult to prevent its\nfurther disclosure\u2014as artfully explored in Joseph Conrad\u2019s\nThe Secret Sharer [10]. This dif\ufb01culty also arises in machine-\nlearning models based on neural networks, which are being\nrapidly adopted for many purposes. What details those models\nmay have unintentionally memorized and may disclose can\nbe of signi\ufb01cant concern, especially when models are public\nand models\u2019 training involves sensitive or private data.\nDisclosure of secrets is of particular concern in neural-\nnetwork models that classify or predict sequences of natural-\nlanguage text. First, such text will often contain sensitive or\nprivate sequences, accidentally, even if the text is supposedly\npublic. Second, such models are designed to learn text pat-\nterns such as grammar, turns of phrase, and spelling, which\ncomprise a vanishing fraction of the exponential space of\nall possible sequences. Therefore, even if sensitive or pri-\nvate training-data text is very rare, one should assume that\nwell-trained models have paid attention to its precise details.\nConcretely, disclosure of secrets may arise naturally in gen-\nerative text models like those used for text auto-completion\nand predictive keyboards, if trained on possibly-sensitive data.\nThe users of such models may discover\u2014either by accident\nor on purpose\u2014that entering certain text pre\ufb01xes causes the\nmodels to output surprisingly-revealing text completions [37].For example, users may \ufb01nd that the input \u201cmy social-security\nnumber is. . . \u201d gets auto-completed to an obvious secret (such\nas a valid-looking SSN not their own), or \ufb01nd that other in-\nputs are auto-completed to text with oddly-speci\ufb01c details. So\ntriggered, unscrupulous or curious users may start to \u201cattack\u201d\nsuch models by entering different input pre\ufb01xes to try to mine\npossibly-secret suf\ufb01xes. Therefore, for generative text mod-\nels, assessing and reducing the chances that secrets may be\ndisclosed in this manner is a key practical concern.\nTo enable practitioners to measure their models\u2019 propensity\nfor disclosing details about private training data, this paper\nintroduces a quantitative metric of exposure . This metric can\nbe applied during training as part of a testing methodology\nthat empirically measures a model\u2019s potential for unintended\nmemorization of unique or rare sequences in the training data.\nOur exposure metric conservatively characterizes knowl-\nedgeable attackers that target secrets unlikely to be discovered\nby accident (or by a most-likely beam search). As validation\nof this, we describe an algorithm guided by the exposure met-\nric that, given a pretrained model, can ef\ufb01ciently extract secret\nsequences even when the model considers parts of them to be\nhighly unlikely. We demonstrate our algorithm\u2019s effectiveness\nin Results of our testing methodology applied to a state-\nof-the-art, word-level neural-network language model [35].\nTwo models are trained to near-identical accuracy using two\ndifferent training strategies (hyperparameters A and B).

The hands-free interac-\ntion mechanism provided by these systems is crucial for use\nin certain critical settings (e.g. in cars or for persons with\nmobility impairments). However, the subjective nature of di-\nalogue (Curry, Hastie, and Rieser 2017; Liu et al. 2016), and\nthe onset of data-driven components (Vinyals and Le 2015;\nSerban et al. 2017c), leads to several potential dangers with\nthe widespread use of these systems.\nEthics and safety in arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) has re-\ncently gained popularity as a \ufb01eld due to performance gains\nin AI models, investigating issues like: interpretability of\nmodel decisions (Kim 2015), worst-case performance guar-\nantees (Garc\u0131a and Fern \u00b4andez 2015), and many others. In\nthe context of dialogue systems, issues of safety and ethics\nare no less important, yet they are rarely discussed in the\nliterature or in practice. As dialogue systems become more\nprevalent and trusted, it is vital to develop systems that ac-\ncount for possible ethical and safety concerns.\nHere, we investigate several crucial aspects of ethics and\nsafety in dialogue systems, which re\ufb02ect modern state-of-\nthe-art research in the \ufb01eld: bias, adversarial examples, pri-\nvacy in learned models, safety, special considerations for re-\ninforcement learning systems, and reproducibility. To high-light these issues, we: investigate possible areas of concern\nin the literature; conduct new experiments and key-pair samples are pro-\nvided in the supplemental material.\nRecommendations and Future Investigations Overall, we\ndemonstrate in a small setting that models that are not prop-\nerly generalized, or that are trained on improperly \ufb01ltered\ndata, can reveal private information through simple elicita-\ntion, even if the sensitive information comprises <0:1%\nof the data. Current dialogue models that use natural lan-\nguage generation should be particularly aware of privacy\nleakage from underlying datasets, especially where data is\nacquired in a sensitive fashion (e.g. in-home devices). Fu-\nture lines of investigation may \ufb01nd the integration of au-\ntomated anonymization (Ororbia et al. 2016) and differen-\ntial privacy (Abadi et al. 2016) bene\ufb01cial for conversational\nmodels. Exploring privacy-aware dialogue models is a pre-\nrequisite for shared learning models that generate natural\nlanguage and that are deployed in production settings.\nSafety\nTo examine safety in the context of dialogue systems, we\nadopt the perspective of (Amodei et al. 2016) and focus on\nthe problem of accidents , de\ufb01ned as unintended or harm-\nful behaviour resulting from poor design. However, de\ufb01ning\nsafe behaviours in dialogue can be challenging and the def-\ninition may change depending on the application context.\nHere, we generally de\ufb01ne a safe behaviour as one that an\nagent takes, which does not cause any offensive or harm-\nful effects to human interlocutors. In chatbots, this could\nmean restricting the action space such that the agent does\nnot output offensive or discriminatory content. Using this\nde\ufb01nition, we examine three risks as our primary foci for\nsafety in dialogue: (1) providing learning performance guar-\nantees; (2) proper objective speci\ufb01cation; (3) model inter-\npretability (Amodei et al. 2016; Garc\u0131a and Fern \u00b4andez 2015;\nDoshi-Velez and Kim 2017). Furthermore, to understand\nwhy these aspects of AI safety are relevant to dialogue sys-tems, we examine highly sensitive and safety-critical set-\ntings where dialogue agents have begun being used. We\nde\ufb01ne three main areas of concern where consideration of\ndialogue system safety and the aforementioned lines", " INTRODUCTION\nMachine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to many data\nanalysis tasks, from recognizing images to predicting retail pur-\nchases.

This\ncan lead to overprovisioning: even an accurate model may be using\nonly a fraction of its raw capacity. The provider of an ML library\nor operator of an ML service can modify the training algorithm so\nthat the model encodes more information about the training dataset\nthan is strictly necessary for high accuracy on its primary task.\nOur contributions. We show that relatively minor modifications\nto training algorithms can produce models that have high quality\nby the standard ML metrics (such as accuracy and generalizability),\nyet leak detailed information about their training datasets.\nWe assume that a malicious ML provider supplies the training al-\ngorithm to the data holder but does not observe its execution. After\nthe model has been created, the provider either obtains the entire\nmodel (white box) or gains input-output access to it (black box). The\nprovider then aims to extract information about the training dataset\nfrom the model. This scenario can arise when the data holder uses a\nmalicious ML library and also in algorithm marketplaces [ 2,27,54]\nthat let data holders pay to use third-party training algorithms in\nan environment secured by the marketplace operator.\nIn the white-box case, we evaluate several techniques: (1) encod-\ning sensitive information about the training dataset directly in the\nleast significant bits of the model parameters, (2) forcing the param-\neters to be highly correlated with the sensitive information, and (3)\nencoding the sensitive information in the signs of the parameters.\nThe latter two techniques involve adding a malicious \u201cregulariza-\ntion\u201d term to the loss function and, from the viewpoint of the data\nholder, could appear as yet another regularization technique.\nIn the black-box case, we use a technique that resembles data\naugmentation (extending the training dataset with additional syn-\nthetic data) without any modifications to the training algorithm.\nThe resulting model is thus, in effect, trained on two tasks. The\nfirst, primary task is the main classification", " Introduction\nRecently, the notion of explainable arti\fcial intelligence has seen a resurgence, after\nhaving slowed since the burst of work on explanation in expert systems over three decades\nago; for example, see Chandrasekaran et al. [23], [168], and Buchanan and Shortli\u000be [14].\nSometimes abbreviated XAI (eXplainable arti\fcial intelligence), the idea can be found\nin grant solicitations [32] and in the popular press [136]. This resurgence is driven by\nevidence that many AI applications have limited take up, or are not appropriated at all,\ndue to ethical concerns [2] and a lack of trust on behalf of their users [166, 101]. The\nrunning hypothesis is that by building more transparent, interpretable, or explainable\nsystems, users will be better equipped to understand and therefore trust the intelligent\nagents [129, 25, 65].\nWhile there are many ways to increase trust and transparency of intelligent agents,\ntwo complementary approaches will form part of many trusted autonomous systems: (1)\ngenerating decisions1in which one of the criteria taken into account during the compu-\ntation is how well a human could understand the decisions in the given context, which\nis often called interpretability orexplainability ; and (2) explicitly explaining decisions\n1We will use decision as the general term to encompass outputs from AI systems, such as categori-\nsations, action selection, etc.\n3to people, which we will call explanation . Applications of explanation are considered in\nmany sub-\felds of arti\fcial intelligence, such as justifying autonomous agent behaviour\n[129, 65], debugging of machine learning models [89], explaining medical decision-making\n[45], and explaining predictions of classi\fers [157].\nIf we want to design, and implement intelligent agents that are truly capable of\nproviding explanations to people , then it is fair to say that models of how humans explain\ndecisions and behaviour to each other are a good way to start analysing the problem.\nResearchers argue that people employ certain biases [82] and social expectations [72] when\nthey generate and evaluate explanation, and I argue that such biases and expectations can\nimprove human interactions with explanatory AI. For example, de Graaf and Malle [34]\nargues that because people assign human-like traits to arti\fcial agents, people will expect\nexplanations using the same conceptual framework used to explain human behaviours.\nDespite the recent resurgence of explainable AI, most of the research and practice in\nthis area seems to use the researchers' intuitions of what constitutes a `good' explanation.\nMiller et al. [132] shows in a small sample that research in explainable AI typically does\nnot cite or build on frameworks of explanation from social science. They argue that\nthis could lead to failure. The very experts who understand decision-making models the\nbest are not in the right position to judge the usefulness of explanations to lay users\n| a phenomenon that Miller et al. refer to (paraphrasing Cooper [31]) as \\the inmates\nrunning the asylum\". Therefore, a strong understanding of how people de\fne, generate,\nselect, evaluate, and present explanations seems almost essential.\nIn the \felds of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, there is a vast and ma-\nture body of work that studies these exact topics. For millennia, philosophers have asked\nthe questions about what constitutes an explanation, what is the function of explana-\ntions, and what are their structure. For over 50 years, cognitive and social psychologists\nhave analysed how people attribute and evaluate the social", " Introduction\nRecent success in scaling reinforcement learning (RL) to large problems has been driven in domains\nthat have a well-speci\ufb01ed reward function (Mnih et al., 2015, 2016; Silver et al., 2016). Unfortunately,\nmany tasks involve goals that are complex, poorly-de\ufb01ned, or hard to specify. Overcoming this\nlimitation would greatly expand the possible impact of deep RL and could increase the reach of\nmachine learning more broadly.\nFor example, suppose that we wanted to use reinforcement learning to train a robot to clean a table or\nscramble an egg. It\u2019s not clear how to construct a suitable reward function, which will need to be a\nfunction of the robot\u2019s sensors. We could try to design a simple reward function that approximately\ncaptures the intended behavior, but this will often result in behavior that optimizes our reward\nfunction without actually satisfying our preferences. This dif\ufb01culty underlies recent concerns about\nmisalignment between our values and the objectives of our RL systems (Bostrom, 2014; Russell,\n2016; Amodei et al., 2016). If we could successfully communicate our actual objectives to our agents,\nit would be a signi\ufb01cant step towards addressing these concerns.\nIf we have demonstrations of the desired task, we can extract a reward function using inverse\nreinforcement learning (Ng and Russell, 2000). This reward function can then be used to train\nan agent with reinforcement learning. More directly, we can use imitation learning to clone the\ndemonstrated behavior. However, these approaches are not directly applicable to behaviors that are\ndif\ufb01cult for humans to demonstrate (such as controlling a robot with many degrees of freedom but\nvery non-human morphology).arXiv:1706.03741v4  [stat.ML]  17 Feb 2023An alternative approach is to allow a human to provide feedback on our system\u2019s current behavior\nand to use this feedback to de\ufb01ne the task. In principle this \ufb01ts within the paradigm of reinforcement\nlearning, but using human feedback directly as a reward function is prohibitively expensive for RL\nsystems that require hundreds or thousands of hours of experience. In order to practically train deep\nRL systems with human feedback, we need to decrease the amount of feedback required by several\norders of magnitude.\nOur approach is to learn a reward function from human feedback and then to optimize that reward\nfunction. This basic approach has been considered previously, but we confront the challenges involved\nin scaling it up to modern deep RL and demonstrate by far the most complex behaviors yet learned\nfrom human feedback.\nIn summary, we desire a solution to sequential decision problems without a well-speci\ufb01ed reward\nfunction that\n1.enables us to solve tasks for which we can only recognize the desired behavior, but not\nnecessarily demonstrate it,\n2. allows agents to be taught by non-expert users,\n3. scales to large problems, and\n4. is economical with user feedback.\nRL algorithm environment observation \naction human \nfeedback reward predictor predicted \nreward \nFigure 1: Schematic illustration of our approach:\nthe reward predictor is trained asynchronously\nfrom comparisons of trajectory segments, and the\nagent maximizes predicted reward.Our algorithm \ufb01ts a reward function to the hu-\nman\u2019s preferences while simultaneously training\na policy to optimize the current predicted reward\nfunction (see Figure 1). We ask the human to\ncompare short video clips of the agent\u2019s behav-\nior, rather than to supply an absolute numerical\nscore. We found comparisons to be easier for hu-\nmans to provide in some", " Introduction\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction", " Introduction\nDeep neural networks achieve state of the art performance on many problems, but are often very\nlarge in depth or width, and contain large numbers of parameters [ 6,25]. This has the drawback that\nthey may be slow to execute or demand large memory to store, limiting their use in applications\nor platforms with low memory or fast execution requirements. This has led to a rapidly growing\narea of research on smaller and faster models. Achieving compact yet accurate models has been\napproached in a variety of ways including explicit frugal architecture design [ 8], model compression\n[20], pruning [13], binarisation [18] and most interestingly model distillation [7].\nDistillation-based model compression relates to the observation [ 3,2] that small networks often\nhave the same representation capacity as large networks; but compared to large networks they are\nsimply harder to train and \ufb01nd the right parameters that realise the desired function. That is, the\nlimitation seems to lie in the dif\ufb01culty of optimisation rather than in the network size [ 2]. To better\nlearn a small network, the distillation approach starts with a powerful (deep and/or wide) teacher\nnetwork (or network ensemble), and then trains a smaller student network to mimic the teacher\n[7,2,16,3]. Mimicking the teacher\u2019s class probabilities [ 7] and/or feature representation [ 2,19]\nconveys additional information beyond the conventional supervised learning target. The optimisation\nproblem of learning to mimic the teacher turns out to be easier than learning the target function\ndirectly, and the much smaller student can match or even outperform [19] the larger teacher.\nIn this paper we explore a different but related idea to model distillation \u2013 that of mutual learning .\nDistillation starts with a powerful large and pre-trained teacher network and performs one-way\nknowledge transfer to a small untrained student. In contrast, in mutual learning we start with a pool\nof untrained students who learn simultaneously to solve the task together. Speci\ufb01cally, each student\nis trained with two losses: a conventional supervised learning loss, and a mimicry loss that aligns\neach student\u2019s class posterior with the class probabilities of other students. Trained in this way, itarXiv:1706.00384v1  [cs.CV]  1 Jun 2017turns out that each student in such a peer-teaching based scenario learns signi\ufb01cantly better than\nwhen learning alone in a conventional supervised learning scenario. Moreover student networks\ntrained in this way achieve better Related Work The distillation-based approach to model compression has been proposed over a\ndecade ago [ 3] but was recently re-popularised by [ 7], where some additional intuition about why\nit works \u2013 due to the additional supervision and regularisation of the higher entropy soft-targets\n\u2013 was presented. Initially, a common application was to distill the function approximated by a\npowerful model/ensemble teacher into a single neural network student [ 3,7]. But later, the idea\nhas been applied to distill powerful and easy-to-train large networks into small but harder-to-train\nnetworks [ 19] that can even outperform their teacher. Recently, distillation has been connected more\nsystematically to information learning theory [ 15] and SVM +[22] \u2013 an intelligent teacher provides\nprivileged information to the student. Here we address dispensing with the teacher altogether, and\nallowing an ensemble of students to teach each other in mutual distillation.\nOther related ideas include Dual Learning [ 5] where", " Introduction\nText classi\ufb01cation is an important task in Natural\nLanguage Processing with many applications, such\nas web search, information retrieval, ranking and\ndocument classi\ufb01cation (Deerwester et al., 1990;\nPangand Lee, 2008). Recently, models based\non neural networks have become increasingly\npopular (Kim,2014; Zhang and LeCun, 2015;\nConneau et al., 2016). While these models achieve\nvery good performance in practice, they tend to be\nrelatively slow both at train and test time, limiting\ntheir use on very large datasets.\nMeanwhile, linear classi\ufb01ers are of-\nten considered as strong baselines for text\nclassi\ufb01cation problems (Joachims, 1998;\nMcCallum and Nigam,1998; Fanet al., 2008).\nDespite their simplicity, they often obtain state-\nof-the-art performances if the right features are\nused (Wang and Manning, 2012). They also\nhave the potential to scale to very large cor-\npus (Agarwal et al., 2014).In this work, we explore ways to scale these\nbaselines to very large corpus with a large output\nspace, in the context of text classi\ufb01cation. Inspired\nby the recent work in ef\ufb01cient word representation\nlearning (Mikolov et al.,2013; Levyet al., 2015),\nwe show that linear models with a rank constraint\nand a fast loss approximation can train on a billion\nwords within ten minutes, while achieving perfor-\nmance on par with the state-of-the-art. We evalu-\nate the quality of our approach fastText1on two\ndifferent tasks, namely tag prediction and sentiment\nanalysis.\n2 Model architecture\nA simple and ef\ufb01cient baseline for sentence\nclassi\ufb01cation is to represent sentences as bag of\nwords (BoW) and train a linear classi\ufb01er, e.g., a\nlogistic regression or an SVM (Joachims, 1998;\nFanet al., 2008). However, linear classi\ufb01ers do\nnot share parameters among features and classes.\nThis possibly limits their generalization in the\ncontext of large output space where some classes\nhave very few examples. Common solutions\nto this problem are to factorize the linear clas-\nsi\ufb01er into low rank matrices (Schutze, 1992;\nMikolov et al., 2013) or to use multilayer\nneural networks (Collobert and Weston, 2008;\nZhang et al., 2015).\nFigure 1 shows a simple linear model with rank\nconstraint.

Manyapplications havebe en proposed in\nthe literature (e.g., [27, 54, 49, 23, 25]) and machine learning algorith ms pervade\nseveral contexts of information technology. ML approaches (su ch as Support\nVector machines, Clustering, Bayesian network, Hidden Markov mo dels, etc.)\nrely on quite distinct mathematical concepts but generally they are employed\nto solve similar problems. A machine learning algorithm consists of two p hases:\ntraining andclassi\ufb01cation . During the training, the ML algorithm is fed with\natraining set of samples. In this phase, the relationships and the correlationsimplied in the training samples are gathered inside the model. Afterwards, the\nmodel is used during the classi\ufb01cation phase to classify and evaluate new data.\nML classi\ufb01ers are usually able to manage a large amount of data and to adapt\nto dynamic environments. Their versatility makes them suitable for s everal im-\nportant tasks. For example, classi\ufb01cation and regression models a re employed\nto analyze current and historical trends to make predictions in \ufb01na ncial mar-\nkets [24, 33, 8], to study biological problems [54], to support medical diagnosis\n[30, 42, 57], to classify network tra\ufb03c or detect anomalies [22, 28, 3 9, 12, 49].\nOne may think that it is safe to release a classi\ufb01er, whether in hardwa re or\nsoftware, since intellectual property laws would prevent anyone f rom producing\na similar apparatus, for example, by copying its code or its design prin ciples.\nHowever, releasing a trained classi\ufb01er may be subject to unexpect ed informa-\ntion leakages that make it possible to produce a competitive product without\nviolating any intellectual property rights.\nLetusconsider,forinstance,aclassi\ufb01er Cathatislesse\ufb00ectivethanaclassi\ufb01er Cb\nproduced by a competitor. The ML algorithms used in Cbmay be publicly avail-\nable or be inferred through reverse engineering. For example, com mercial soft-\nware products for speech recognition, such as Nuance Dragon Na turallySpeak-\ning [1], utilize widely studied Hidden Markov Models. These algorithms, alo ng\nwiththeiroptimizations,arewell-understoodandquitestandard.T hus,thecom-\nmon assumption is that anyone can easily replicate them. In particula r, we could\nassume that the training set used for Cbissuperior, in the sense that makes Cb\nmore e\ufb00ective than Caeven though both implement essentially the same ML\nalgorithms. What makes Cbbetter than Cais the speci\ufb01c knowledge formed dur-\ning the training phase, inferred by the training set. For instance, a classi\ufb01er that\nmakes stock market predictions based on neural network holds its power in the\nweights at its hidden layer (see A). But those weights depend exclus ively on the\ntraining set, hence valuable information that must be treasured.\nThus, it is fair to ask: Is it safe to release a pro\ufb01table ML classi\ufb01er? W ould\nselling a software/hardwareclassi\ufb01er reveal concrete hints abou t its training set,\nuncovering the secrets of its e\ufb00ectiveness and jeopardizing the v endor?\nWe show that a classi\ufb01er can be hacked and that it is possible to extra ct\nfrom it meaningful information about its training set. This can be acc omplished\nbecause a typical ML classi\ufb01er learns by changing its internal struc ture to ab-\nsorb the information contained in the training data. In particular, w e devise and\ntrain a meta-classi\ufb01erthat can successfully detect and classify th ese changes and\ndeduce valuable information.

By leveraging LLMs, we can improve the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles, which has broader implications for public acceptance and regulatory approval of AD technologies. This research could pave the way for more sophisticated and adaptable driving systems, ultimately leading to practical applications in real-world scenarios and influencing future research directions in both AI and robotics.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe integration of LLMs into autonomous driving systems is complex due to several challenges. First, the reasoning required in critical scenarios is often context-dependent and may not be easily captured by existing models. Naive approaches that simply replace current components with LLMs may fail to account for the unique demands of driving, such as real-time decision-making and the need for closed-loop simulation to validate performance. Additionally, there are technical obstacles related to the computational efficiency of LLMs, as they typically require significant resources, which may not be feasible for real-time applications in autonomous driving.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on enhancing autonomous driving systems through traditional methods without fully exploring the potential of LLMs. Existing solutions often lack the integration of closed-loop simulations, which are essential for validating the performance of planners in dynamic environments. Barriers such as the complexity of human-like reasoning and the computational demands of LLMs have hindered progress. Our approach differs by proposing a dual-layer framework that combines rule-based motion planning with LLM reasoning, aiming to replicate human cognitive processes in driving, thus addressing the limitations of prior work.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a rule-based text encoder to convert driving scenarios into text descriptions, enhancing the LLM's understanding of these scenarios. We will utilize a dataset of diverse driving situations to train and evaluate our model. The key metric for success will be the performance of the integrated model in planning and executing driving tasks in critical scenarios. We expect that our DualAD framework will demonstrate improved planning efficiency and decision-making capabilities, ultimately leading to safer and more reliable autonomous driving systems.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can a hybrid decision-making framework that integrates real-time human behavior modeling and large language models (LLMs) enhance maneuver reasoning for autonomous vehicles in dynamic urban environments?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem is crucial as it directly impacts the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles operating in complex urban settings. By integrating human behavior modeling with LLMs, this research could lead to significant advancements in the interpretability and adaptability of autonomous driving systems. The broader implications include the development of vehicles that can better predict and respond to pedestrian actions, thereby reducing accidents and improving traffic flow. Furthermore, this research could pioneer new methodologies for human-machine interaction, potentially influencing future studies on autonomous systems across various domains, including robotics and urban planning.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThis problem is challenging due to the intricacies involved in accurately modeling human behavior, which is often unpredictable and context-dependent. Naive approaches that solely rely on traditional machine learning or rule-based systems may fail to account for the subtle nuances of human actions and intentions. Additionally, technical obstacles such as the integration of LLMs with real-time data processing and the need for extensive, diverse datasets that capture the variability of human behavior complicate the task. There is also a significant theoretical challenge in developing a framework that effectively combines linguistic context with behavioral predictions in a coherent manner.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either deep learning methods for behavior prediction or the development of datasets with limited contextual understanding. Existing solutions often lack the capability to dynamically adapt to changing pedestrian intentions and social interactions, which are critical for real-world applications. Furthermore, many prior studies have not effectively utilized LLMs, which have shown promise in contextual reasoning but remain underexplored in the field of autonomous driving. My approach improves upon prior work by creating a hybrid framework that combines real-time human behavior modeling with advanced LLMs, addressing both the technical and theoretical gaps identified in previous studies.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid decision-making framework that utilizes real-time data from sensors and LLMs to interpret and predict pedestrian behaviors. This will include the use of publicly available datasets, such as JAAD and WiDEVIEW, for training and validating the model's performance. Key metrics for evaluation will include prediction accuracy, response time, and safety outcomes in simulated urban environments. The expected outcomes include enhanced prediction accuracy of pedestrian behaviors, improved safety metrics for autonomous maneuvers, and the demonstration of the framework's ability to adapt to diverse urban traffic scenarios, ultimately bridging the gap between human reasoning and machine decision-making.", "referenced_intros": [" Introduction\nThe rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been phenomenal [ 57]. Take one of\nthe most successful model series, the OpenAI\u2019s GPT models, as an example: the original GPT-3\nmodel released in 2020 [ 3] marked a significant scale-up from GPT-1\u2019s 117 million parameters and\nGPT-2\u2019s 1.5 billion parameters, to 175 billion parameters. This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B. Later, ChatGPT further motivated us\nto align the base models with SFT and RLHF. We created and crafted the prompt-response pairs from\nscratch and performed SFT, while also starting to examine how to effectively apply RLHF.

For example, whereas in the past we had special-\npurpose solutions for different language processing tasks\n(e.g., sentiment analysis, parsing, dialogue), modern large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are competent at all these tasks\nusing a single set of weights (Srivastava et al., 2022). Uni-\nfied systems are also being built across data modalities:\ninstead of using a different architecture for processing im-\nages versus text, recent models, such as GPT4-V (Ope-\nnAI, 2023), Gemini (Google, 2023), and LLaV A (Liu et al.,\n2023), handle both modalities with a combined architecture.\nMore and more systems are built off of general-purpose\npretrained backbones, sometimes called foundation mod-\nels (Bommasani et al., 2021), that support a large range\nof tasks, including robotics (Driess et al., 2023; Brohan\n*Equal contribution1MIT.

In short, AI systems are becom-\ning increasingly homogeneous in both their architectures\nand their capabilities.\nThis paper explores one aspect of this trend: representational\nconvergence. We argue that there is a growing similarity\nin how datapoints are represented in different neural net-\nwork models. This similarity spans across different model\narchitectures, training objectives, and even data modalities.\nWhat has led to this convergence? Will it continue? And\nultimately, where does it end?\nOur central hypothesis, stated above in Figure 1, is that there\nis indeed an endpoint to this convergence and a principle\nthat drives it: different models are all trying to arrive at a\n1arXiv:2405.07987v5  [cs.LG]  25 Jul 2024The Platonic Representation Hypothesis\nrepresentation of reality , meaning a representation of the\njoint distribution over events in the world that generate the\ndata we observe. Figure 1 conveys this hypothesis: there\nexists a real world (labeled Z), which we measure with\nvarious sensors, such as the camera shown to the left ( X).\nOther projections of these measurements, such as the tex-\ntual description shown, can be produced from the first set\nof measurements or mediated by some other set of measure-\nments, e.g., touch or other camera views (dotted arrow from\nXtoY)1. Representation learning algorithms find vector\nembeddings that statistically model the various measure-\nments and projections. The resulting vector embeddings\nare all derived from the underlying reality in Zand thereby\nbecome aligned. As models are trained on more data and for\nmore tasks, they require representations that capture more\nand more information about Z, and hence alignment toward\nZincreases toward a convergent point as a function of scale.\nWe call this converged hypothetical representation the \u201cpla-\ntonic representation\u201d in reference to Plato\u2019s Allegory of the\nCave (Plato, c. 375 BC), and his idea of an ideal reality\nthat underlies our sensations.

C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we addressed the critical challenge of long-\nterm prediction in autonomous driving, with a focus on\nemergency cut-in scenarios where semantic environmental\ncues are pivotal. We introduced the ESP problem, curated the\nESP-Dataset enriched with semantic environment informa-\ntion, and introduced the Clamped Temporal Error (CTE) met-\nric for time-sensitive emergency scenario assessment. Our\nESP feature extraction with the ESP encoder significantly\nboosted existing prediction experiments. Furthermore, we unveiled the potential of incor-\nporating ESP features into large language models like GPT\nto make better predictions by using extrospective cues.\nIn the future, we plan to make the ESP-dataset available\nto the research community and also continue expanding the\nESP-Dataset by including more diverse and challenging sce-\nnarios. Additionally, our research will focus on developing\nadvanced ESP encoders that incorporate causal reasoning\ntechniques for further improvement. Furthermore, fine-tuning\nLLMs with ESP features, aiming to improve scenario under-\nstanding for autonomous vehicles, is an interesting direction.

A primary hurdle to a fully autonomous driving system is\nscene understanding [1], which involves navigating complex, unpredictable scenarios such as ad-\nverse weather, intricate road layouts, and unforeseen human behaviors.\nExisting autonomous driving systems, typically comprising 3D perception, motion prediction, and\nplanning, struggle with these scene understanding challenges. Specifically, 3D perception [2, 3, 4, 5]\nis limited to detecting and tracking familiar objects, omitting rare objects and their unique attributes;\nmotion prediction [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and planning [11, 12, 13] focus on trajectory-level actions, often\nneglecting the decision-level interactions between objects and vehicles.\nWe introduce DriveVLM , a novel autonomous driving system that aims at these scene understanding\nchallenges, capitalizing on the recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [14, 15, 16, 17] which have\ndemonstrated exceptional prowess in visual comprehension and reasoning. Specifically, DriveVLM\ncontains a Chain-of-Though (CoT) process with three key modules: scene description ,scene anal-\nysis, and hierarchical planning . The scene description module linguistically depicts the driving\nenvironment and identifies critical objects in the scene; the scene analysis module delves into the\ncharacteristics of the critical objects and their influence on the ego vehicle; the hierarchical planning\nmodule formulates plans step-by-step, from meta-actions and decision descriptions to waypoints.\nThese modules respectively correspond to the components of the traditional perception-prediction-\n\u2217Equal contribution.

This dual sys-\ntem design, akin to the human brain\u2019s slow and fast thinking processes, adapts efficiently to varying\ncomplexity in driving scenarios.\nMeanwhile, we formally define the scene understanding and planning (SUP) task, and propose new\nevaluation metrics to assess the scene analysis and meta-action planning capabilities of DriveVLM\nand DriveVLM-Dual.

RELATED WORK\nMotion planning is a critical component in the software\ndevelopment of autonomous vehicles [3]. Motion planners\noperate on a specific time horizon and attempt to avoid\nobstacles while quickly generating an efficient and reliable\nlocal trajectory. The trajectory includes a path of x(t)\nandy(t)coordinates and a velocity profile v(t), which\nprovide the reference information for subsequent control.\nThis task is complex due to dynamic and unpredictable road\nenvironments, especially in urban settings with static and\ndynamic obstacles like pedestrians and other vehicles [4].\nSeveral concepts have been developed from various theoreti-\ncal foundations in recent decades [5], [6]. The RESULTS & ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we will first examine the algorithm in simula-\ntion before demonstrating its applicability in a real vehicle.\nThe aim is to examine the framework and the trajectory\nplanner as standalone tools rather than comparing them to\nspecific alternatives. This is because their performance can\nbe continually enhanced through individual extensions.\nA.

The A V has to\nfind a trajectory in given scenarios to reach the goal region\nin a limited amount of time without a collision and in a kine-\nmatically feasible way.

For instance, some researchers\nground the instruction prompts to single or multiple objects\nfor 2D or 3D object detection and tracking [9, 45\u201347, 51].\nNuscenes-QA [41] offers numerous question-answer pairs\nfor multi-view perception tasks in driving scenes.

(i) Partial tasks . Ex-\nisting benchmarks only cover a subset of autonomous driv-\ning tasks. However, autonomous driving comprises a series\nof interdependent tasks, each indispensable to the system\u2019s\noverall functionality [2]. For instance, it is challenging to\nmake reliable predictions when lacking accurate perception.\n(ii) Incomplete information . The information utilized by\nexisting methods, e.g., ChatGPT-based [48] or\nhuman-based [10], this structured design ensures the gener-\nation of instruction-response pairs is both reliable and scal-\nable.\nWe only describe the overview of the data generation in\nthis section. Please refer to the supplementary material for\nmore details about the scene information database, the task\nSQLs, and the retrieval process.\n3.2. Data Statistics\nTo construct our NuInstruct, we sampled a total of\n11,850 keyframes from 850 videos within the NuScenes\ndataset [2]. Subsequent filter yields 55,204 unique in-\nstances, which collectively appear 295,828 times across\nall keyframes. This culminates in an average of approxi-\nmately 24.96instances per keyframe.

One key requirement is generalization, which involves the ability to handle\nunseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations. A secondary requirement\npertains to the interaction of these models with humans, highlighted for example\nby EU regulations that mandate explainability in deployment [3]. Furthermore,\nunlike today\u2019s AD models, humans do not navigate based on geometrically pre-\ncise bird\u2019s-eye view (BEV) representations [17,32,46]. Instead, humans implicitly\nperform object-centric perception, prediction, and planning (which we refer to\nasP1\u22123): a rough identification and localization of key objects, followed by rea-\nsoning about their possible movement and aggregation of this information into\na driving action [60,76].\nSimultaneously, another field has been forging ahead: Vision-Language Mod-\nels (VLMs) [47,54,90,106]. These models have several strengths. First, they hold\na base understanding of the world from internet-scale data that could potentially\nfacilitate generalization for planning in AD. In fact, this sort of generalization\nhas already been achieved by VLMs for simpler robotics tasks [23,108]. Sec-\nond, the use of language representations as an input and output offers a plat-\nform for human-friendly interaction with these models, unlike bounding boxes\nor trajectories that are more common to current methods show-\ncase the capabilities of LLMs in embodied planning tasks, inspiring us to apply\nthem to address the current shortcomings in generalization in AD, which is far\nless explored.\nVision-language Benchmarks for Driving. An increasing number of vision-\nlanguage datasets have been proposed for AD systems [20,41,42,56,59,67,71,\n97,98,101,107]. NuScenes-QA [67] and NuPrompt [98] provide perceptual in-\nformation as text by describing the positions and states of surrounding objects.\nBDD-X [42] provides reasons for the ego vehicle\u2019s actions in natural language de-\nscriptions. DRAMA [56] and Rank2Tell [71] identify crucial objects and provide\ncorresponding driving suggestions. However, these datasets focus on scene-level\ncontext or individual objects. DriveLM fills this gap in the literature by organiz-\ning language annotations from object-level and task-level with a graph structure.\nI Broader Impact\nWe believe that this approach can accelerate progress in the field of autonomous\ndriving by enabling it to directly benefit from better VLMs. Our goal is to\nmake progress towards autonomous driving, which will have profound impact\nif successful. We recognize that by bringing VLMs into this area, we accept\ntheir ethical implications, such as hallucinations and high resource use. Yet, by\nimproving the interactivity between humans and autonomous driving systems,\nwe can build confidence in the technology. This could hasten its acceptance and\nlead to safer transportation in the long term. experiments of each of each subsections in Section 4 in the\nmain paper.\nFine-tuning Details. We configure the learning rate as 0.0001, no learning-\nrate scheduler, random seed as 1234, and other settings following the default\nLoRA [30] configuration.

While both of these approaches are widely\nadopted and constantly making breakthroughs on challeng-\ning benchmarks, both of them share a limitation in that they\nsolely rely on fixed-format inputs such as the sensor data,\ntarget waypoints, and action commands, which restricts the\nagent\u2019s ability to comprehend multi-modal information and\nto interact with humans and the environment.

To name\na few: 1) in long-tail unforeseen events and challenging ur-\nban situations ( e.g.complex and dense intersections) where\nmodern A V systems typically struggle [41] or even incur se-\nrious accidents [37], the language-aware A Vs can easily sur-\nvive by following navigation instructions from passengers\nor navigation software. 2) A Vs can adapt to passengers\u2019\nsudden notice ( e.g.small objects that are easily missed by\nperception systems) simply via natural language, which was\npreviously non-trial and required a large amount of hand-\ncrafted rules.\nToward these appealing properties, many pioneering\nworks have explored the potential of using large language\nmodels to enhance the A V system\u2019s reasoning abilities, in-\nterpretability, and overall performance in open-loop set-\ntings. One of the most common strategies [6, 11, 28, 32]\nis to 1) first use LLMs to transform the scene perception re-\nsults and navigation commands into textual descriptions; 2)\nfeed these textural descriptions into LLMs to generate tex-\ntual driving decisions; and then 3) transfer textual driving\ndecisions into executable control commands.

Most ex-\nisting datasets [11,35,43] often over-\nsimplify the complex processes of\ndriving into straightforward question-\nanswering tasks with only a few\nspecific tasks covered.

However, autonomous driving transcends a sim-\nplistic QA process. It encompasses a multi-step approach involving perception ,\nprediction , and reasoning , each of which plays an indispensable role in the\ndecision-making.

The essential aspiration is to design\nautonomous vehicles (A Vs) capable of maneuvering through complex real-world driving situations with human-like\nunderstanding and responsiveness.\nCurrent autonomous driving systems (ADS) [ 4] are data-driven and typically modular, dividing tasks like perception,\nprediction, planning and control [ 5]. However, these systems struggle with integration and performance in varied\nsituations. End-to-end (E2E) designs offer a direct sensory input to control output mapping, but they lack interpretability,\nposing challenges in safety and regulatory compliance [6, 7, 8].\nMoreover, existing ADS exhibit many limitations when compared with human drivers including: (1) Holistic Under-\nstanding and Interpretation : existing data-driven Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) often fall short in holistically\nunderstanding and interpreting dynamic and complex scenarios, especially those within the long-tail distribution of\nopen-world driving environments [ 9,10]. For instance, considering a scenario where a ball bounces onto the road,\nfollowed by a child running after it, a human driver could immediately deduce the potential danger and act accordingly\nto prevent any mishap, leveraging a blend of common sense, past experiences, and a fundamental understanding of\nhuman behaviors. In contrast, existing ADS might struggle to interpret this scenario accurately without prior exposure\nto a large amount of similar data. This lack of holistic understanding limits the system\u2019s ability to generalize well\nacross unexpected scenarios that may be located in the long tail of the data distribution [ 11,12]. (2) Instant Learning\nand Adaptation : unlike human drivers who can instantly learn and adapt to new scenarios with just a few examples,\nexisting ADS requires extensive training with large amounts of data to handle new situations. For example, a humanarXiv:2312.00438v1  [cs.CV]  1 Dec 2023driver can quickly learn to navigate around a new type of road obstacle after encountering it once or twice, whereas an\nADS might require exposure to many similar scenarios to learn the same lesson. (3) Reflection and Error Recovery :\nexisting ADS typically employ feedforward processing during operation, lacking the capability for real-time correction\nbased on feedback and guidance. In contrast, human drivers can correct their driving behavior in real time based on\nfeedback. For instance, if a human driver takes a wrong turn, they can quickly adjust their decision based on the error\nfeedback, whereas an ADS might struggle to quickly recover from the error feedback [13, 14].\nThese limitations underline the need for an intermediate framework that can bridge the gap between the current state of\nA V systems and human-like driving. Recent advancements in (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) [ 15,16,17]\nwith emergent abilities offer a hopeful path toward addressing these challenges. These models are endowed with a\nrich repository of human knowledge, laying the foundation for valuable insights that could significantly improve ADS.\nHowever, these model are mainly trained on general vision and language data, which restricts their efficacy in the\nspecialized driving domain. Moreover, current model designs can only digest static image and text data to generate\nzero-shot decisions, lacking in handling temporal video input and in-context learning.\nIn this paper, we propose Dolphins (shown in Figure 1), a vision", "Abstract \u2014 As autonomous driving technology matures, end-\nto-end methodologies have emerged as a leading strategy,\npromising seamless integration from perception to control\nvia deep learning. However, existing systems grapple with\nchallenges such as unexpected open set environments and the\ncomplexity of black-box models. At the same time, the evolution\nof deep learning introduces larger, multimodal foundational\nmodels, offering multi-modal visual and textual understanding.\nIn this paper, we harness these multimodal foundation models to\nenhance the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving\nsystems, enabling out-of-distribution, end-to-end, multimodal,\nand more explainable autonomy. Specifically, we present an\napproach to apply end-to-end open-set (any environment/scene)\nautonomous driving that is capable of providing driving de-\ncisions from representations queryable by image and text.\nTo do so, we introduce a method to extract nuanced spa-\ntial (pixel/patch-aligned) features from transformers to en-\nable the encapsulation of both spatial and semantic features.\nOur approach (i) demonstrates unparalleledresults for various\nmaneuver types using low-dimensional projected features.\nThis evaluation diverges from a closed-loop control setting,\nas \u201dfeatures-to-control\u201d requires more complex models than\nlinear functions. Our research question aims to explore the\nexistence of simple decision boundaries that differentiate\nhigher-level maneuvers (e.g., avoidance vs. 0.5 steering an-\ngle) and examine how feature spatial distribution within an\nimage influences classification.

Visualizations of typical maneuvers and classifier\ncoefficients show more structured coefficients in the image\u2019s\nlower part, closely linked to driving maneuvers. For Car,\nnegative coefficients (in blue) appear in the road\u2019s center\nduring lane-stable maneuvers, indicating that no cars should\nobstruct the path. Positive coefficients (in red) are observed\nthroughout the road during avoidance, suggesting that cars\ncan appear anywhere. During recovery, these coefficients are\nmainly positive at the road\u2019s edges, as the ego car initiates\nrecovery only after passing other vehicles. For Road &\nTree, positive coefficients clutter at the image\u2019s edges during\navoidance, reflecting the ego car\u2019s heading deviation from\nthe road to evade obstacles. In lane-stable and recovery, these\ncoefficients are variably distributed in the middle, aligning\nwith the ego car\u2019s road-oriented direction.\nD.

Under review.arXiv:2310.01957v2  [cs.RO]  13 Oct 2023Remarkable abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate early signs of artificial general\nintelligence (AGI) [ 1], exhibiting capabilities such as out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning, common\nsense understanding, knowledge retrieval, and the ability to naturally communicate these aspects with\nhumans. These capabilities align well with the focus areas of autonomous driving and robotics [ 2]\n[3].\nModern scalable autonomous driving systems, whether they adopt an end-to-end approach using\na single network [ 4], or a component-based configuration that combines learnable perception and\nmotion planning modules [ 5] [6], face common challenges. These systems often behave as \u2019black-\nboxes\u2019 in the decision making process, making it especially difficult to endow them with OOD\nreasoning and interpretability capabilities. Such issues persist even though there have been some\nstrides towards addressing them [7].\nTextual or symbolic modality, with its inherent suitability for logical reasoning, knowledge retrieval,\nand human communication, serves as an excellent medium for harnessing the capabilities of LLMs\n[8]. However, its linear sequential nature limits nuanced spatial understanding [ 1], a crucial aspect of\nautonomous navigation. Pioneering work in Visual Language Models (VLMs) has begun to bridge\nthis gap by merging visual and text modalities [ 9], enabling spatial reasoning with the power of pre-\ntrained LLMs. However, effectively incorporating the new modality into the language representation\nspace requires extensive pretraining with a significant volume of labeled image data.\nWe propose a novel methodology for integrating the numeric vector modality, a type of data that is\nfrequently used in robotics for representing speed, actuator positions and distance measurements,\ninto pre-trained LLMs. Such modality is considerably more compact than vision alleviating some of\nthe VLM scaling challenges. Specifically, we fuse vectorized object-level 2D scene representation,\ncommonly used in autonomous driving, into a pre-trained LLM with adapters [ 10]. This fusion\nenables the model to directly interpret and reason about comprehensive driving situations. As a result,\nthe LLMs are empowered to serve as the \u201cbrain\u201c of the autonomous driving system, interacting\ndirectly with the simulator to facilitate reasoning and action prediction.\nTo obtain training data in a scalable way, we first use a custom 2D simulator and train a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) agent to solve the driving scenarios, serving as a substitute for a human driving expert.\nTo ground the object-level vector into LLMs, we introduce a language generator that translates this\nnumerical data into textual descriptions for representation pretraining. We further leverage a teacher\nLLM (GPT) to generate a question-answering dataset conditioned on the language descriptions of\n10k different driving scenarios. Our model first undergoes a pretraining phase that enhances the\nalignment between the numeric vector modality and the latent language representations. Next, we\ntrain our novel architecture to establish a robust baseline model, LLM-driver, for the driving action\nprediction and driving question answering tasks. We provide our datasets, evaluation benchmarks\nand a pre-trained model1for reproducibility and hope to inspire and facilitate further advancements\nin the field.

On the other hand, the reflection prompts section\nincludes the scenario description of the erroneous decision and the faulty reasoning process made by\nthe LLM. We require the reflection module to produce three components: an error analysis, corrected\nreasoning and decision-making, and suggestions on how to avoid making the same mistake in the\nfuture.\nA.3 C ASE STUDY\nIn this section, let\u2019s demonstrate several case studies.\nFirst, we present the conclusion of a driving session. To achieve this goal, we pro-\npose the Reflection module in DiLu, which continuously learns from past driving experiences. DiLu\ncan progressively improve its performance through the Reflection module, similar to the progression\nof a novice becoming an experienced driver.\nThe Reflection module is illustrated in Figure 5. During the closed-loop driving task, we record the\nprompts used as input based on the driving scenario and the corresponding decisions generated by\nthe LLM for each decision frame. Once a driving session concludes, we obtain a decision sequence,\ne.g., 5 decision frames from 0 to 4 in Figure 5. When the session ends without any collisions or\nhazardous incidents, indicating a successful session, DiLu proceeds to sample several key decision\nframes from the sequence. These frames then directly become part of the historical driving experi-\nence and enrich the Memory module.\nOn the contrary, if the current session is terminated due to hazardous situations such as collisions\nwith other vehicles, this indicates that the driver agent has made inaccurate decisions. It is crucial for\nthe system to rectify the unsafe decision made by the Reasoning module. Thanks to the interpretable\nchain-of-thoughts responses, we can easily find the causes of dangerous situations. Certainly, we can\nask a human expert to complete such an error correction process. However, our goal is to make the\nautonomous driving system learn from mistakes on its own. We discover that LLM can effectively\nact as a mistake rectifier. Our approach is to use the driving scenarios in which incorrect decisions\noccurred, together with the original reasoning output, as prompts for LLM. We instruct LLM to\npinpoint the reasons behind the incorrect decision and provide the correct one. We also ask LLM to\npropose strategies in order to avoid similar errors in the future. Finally, the correct reasoning process\nand the revised decision learned from the mistakes are retained in Memory module.\n4 E XPERIMENTS\nIn our experimental setup, we utilize the well-established Highway-env as our simulation environ-\nment, which is a widely used platform in the fields of autonomous driving and tactical decision-\nmaking (Leurent, 2018).

Osinski, H.", " Introduction\nDespite learning-based systems\u2019 success in vehicle motion planning research [ 1,2,3,4,5], a lack\nof standardized large-scale datasets for benchmarking holds back their transfer from research to\napplications [ 6,7,8]. The recent release of the nuPlan dataset and simulator [ 9], a collection of\n1300 hours of real-world vehicle motion data, has changed this, enabling the development of a new\ngeneration of learned motion planners, which promise reduced manual design effort and improved\nscalability. Equipped with this new benchmark, we perform the first rigorous empirical analysis\non a large-scale, open-source, and data-driven simulator for vehicle motion planning, including a\ncomprehensive set of state-of-the-art (SoTA) planners [ 10,11,12] using the official metrics. Our\nanalysis yields several surprising findings:\nOpen- and closed-loop evaluation are misaligned. Most learned planners are trained through\nthe supervised learning task of forecasting the ego vehicle\u2019s future motion conditioned on a desired\ngoal location. We refer to this setting as ego-forecasting [ 2,3,13,14]. In nuPlan, planners can\nbe evaluated in two ways: (1) in open-loop evaluation, which measures ego-forecasting accuracy\nusing distance-based metrics or (2) in closed-loop evaluation, which assesses the actual driving\nperformance in simulation with metrics such as progress or collision rates. Open-loop evaluation\nlacks dynamic feedback and can have little correlation with closed-loop driving, as previously shown\non the simplistic CARLA simulator [ 15,16]. Our primary contribution lies in uncovering a negative\ncorrelation between both evaluation schemes. Learned planners excel at ego-forecasting but struggle\nto make safe closed-loop plans, whereas rule-based planners exhibit the opposite trend.\nRule-based planning generalizes. We surprisingly find that an established rule-based planning\nbaseline from over twenty years ago [ 17] surpasses all SoTA learning-based experiments, aside from the held-out\ntest set, have not specifically evaluated the model\u2019s generalization capabilities when encountering\ndistributional shifts, such as unseen towns or novel scenario types. They were all conducted on a\nsingle simulator, nuPlan. Therefore, it is important to recognize the limitations inherent in nuPlan\u2019s\ndata-driven simulation approach. When a planner advances more rapidly than the human driving log,\nobjects materialize abruptly in front of the ego-vehicle during simulation. For CLS-NR, vehicles move\nindependently as observed in reality, disregarding the ego agent, leading to excessively aggressive\nbehavior. Conversely, CLS-R Related Work\nRule-based planning. Rule-based planners offer a structured, interpretable decision-making\nframework [ 17,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. They employ explicit rules to determine an autonomous\nvehicle\u2019s behavior (e.g., brake when an object is straight ahead). A seminal approach in rule-based\nplanning is the Intelligent Driver Model ( IDM[17]), which is designed to follow a leading vehicle in\ntraffic while maintaining a safe distance. There exist extensions of IDM[27] which focus on enabling\nlane changes on highways. However, this is not the goal of our work. Instead, we extend IDMby\nexecuting multiple policies with different hyperparameters, and scoring them to select the best option.\nPrior work also combines rule-based decision-making with learned components, e.g., with learned\nagent forecasts [ 28], affordance indicators [ 23,24], cost-based imitation learning [ 4,29,30,31,32],\nor learning-based planning with rule-based safety filtering [ 33]. These hybrid planners often forecast\nfuture environmental states, enabling informed and contingent driving decisions. This forecasting can\neither be agent-centric [ 34,35,36], where trajectories are determined for each actor, or environment-\ncentric [ 4,31,30,29,37,38], involving occupancy or cost maps. Additionally, forecasting can be\nconditioned on the ego-plan, modeling the ego vehicle\u2019s influence on the", " Introduction\nDespite significant recent progress in the field of au-\ntonomous driving, truly large-scale deployment of au-\ntonomous vehicles (A Vs) on public roads has yet to be\nestablished. The majority of the remaining issues lie in\nnavigating dense urban traffic scenes, where a large num-\nber of different dynamic objects (e.g. vehicles, bicycles,\npedestrians), complex road geometries and road user inter-\nactions are involved. In such circumstances, currently de-\nployed or tested solutions could make incorrect or unex-\npected decisions , resulting in severe accidents or traffic in-\nfractions [4, 24, 53].

Recent works mainly consist of reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) background traffic. Compared to a previous occlusion\nbenchmark AUTOCASTSIM [19], the DOS benchmark: 1)\nincludes occlusions of both vehicles and pedestrians, in-\nstead of only vehicles; 2) includes 100 cases of 4 scenar-\nios, instead of only 3 cases of 3 scenarios; 3) considers spe-\ncific occlusions that can potentially be resolved by temporal\nreasoning (intermittent occlusion, #1, #3) and global rea-\nsoning (constant occlusion but with interaction clues, #2,\n#4) about the scene, instead of random occlusions as in\nAUTOCASTSIM.

We use the implementation1provided by ST-\nP3 [7] to evaluate the output trajectories for time horizons of\n1s, 2s, and 3s. To evaluate the quality of the predicted ego\ntrajectories, two commonly used metrics [7\u20139] are calcu-\nlated: L2 error (in meters) and collision rate (in percentage).\nThe average L2 errors are calculated between the predicted\nand ground-truth trajectories for corresponding waypoints\nwithin the next 1s, 2s, and 3s time horizons, respectively.\nTo determine how often the ego vehicle collides with other\nobjects, the collision rate is computed by placing a box rep-\n1https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/ST-P3/blob/\nmain/stp3/metrics.pyresenting the ego vehicle at each waypoint on the predicted\ntrajectory and then detecting if any collision with other ori-\nented bounding boxes that represent vehicles and pedestri-\nans in the scene occurs.\n3.2.

Our mitigations and processes alter GPT-4\u2019s behavior and prevent certain\nkinds of misuses, though they have limitations, pointing to the need for anticipatory planning and\ngovernance[ 11] and further safety research. Our approach to deployment balances minimizing risk\nfrom deployment, enabling positive use cases, and learning from deployment.\nGPT models are often trained in two stages. First, they are trained, using a large dataset of text\nfrom the Internet, to predict the next word. The models are then \ufb01ne-tuned with additional data,\nusing an algorithm called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to produce outputs\nthat are preferred by human labelers.[ 10,12,13] Training language models on large text datasets\nhas given rise to capabilities such as few-shot learning[ 10] and the ability to carry out a wide range\nof natural language tasks spanning di\ufb00erent domains, including question answering, arithmetic, and\nclassi\ufb01cation. Fine-tuning has made these models more controllable and useful.\n1.1 Overview of \ufb01ndings and mitigations\nIn this system card,1we outline the safety challenges that arise from GPT-4, and explain the\ninterventions we implemented to mitigate potential harms from its deployment. We focus on safety\nchallenges not because they necessarily outweigh the potential bene\ufb01ts,2but because we wish to\nmotivate further work in safety measurement, mitigation, and assurance. The scope of this system\ncard is narrower than the potential scope of abilities GPT-4 can be used to unlock; notably, both\ncustom \ufb01ne-tuning and image capabilities are explicitly out of scope.\nWe focus on analyzing two versions of the model: an early version \ufb01ne-tuned for instruction\nfollowing (\u201cGPT-4-early\u201d); and a version \ufb01ne-tuned for increased helpfulness and harmlessness[ 18]\nthat re\ufb02ects the further mitigations outlined in this system card (\u201cGPT-4-launch\u201d).3When we\ndiscuss the risks of GPT-4 we will often refer to the behavior of GPT-4-early, because it re\ufb02ects the\nrisks of GPT-4 when minimal safety mitigations are applied. In most cases, GPT-4-launch exhibits\nmuch safer behavior due to the safety mitigations we applied.\nKnown risks associated with smaller language models are also present with GPT-4. GPT-4\ncan generate potentially harmful content, such as advice on planning attacks or hate speech. It\ncan represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the users\nintent,4or of widely shared values. It can also generate code that is compromised or vulnerable.\nThe additional capabilities of GPT-4 also lead to new risk surfaces.\nTo understand the extent of these risks, we engaged more than 50 experts to help us gain a more\nrobust understanding of the GPT-4 model and potential deployment risks. We selected these areas\n1This document takes inspiration from the concepts of model cards and system cards.[ 14,15,16] This document\noften takes the system level of analysis, with that system including non-model mitigations such as use policies, access\ncontrols, and", " Introduction\nScene understanding for safe autonomous driving can\nbe achieved through semantic segmentation using camera\n2D images and LiDAR 3D point clouds, which densely\nclassifies each smallest sensing unit of the modality. The\nimage-based 2D semantic segmentation has been developed\nwith massive solid studies [12, 34, 61, 63]. The camera\nimage has rich appearance information about the object but\nseverely suffers from illumination, varying object scales,\nand indirect applications in the 3D world. Another modal-\nity, LiDAR point cloud, drives 3D semantic segmentation\nwith laser points [1, 3, 11, 37]. Unfortunately, irregularlaser points are too sparse to capture the details of objects.\nThe inaccurate segmentation appears especially on small\nand distant objects. The other under-explored direction is\nusing multi-modal data to increase both the robustness and\naccuracy in 3D semantic segmentation [67].\nDespite the conceptual superiority, the development of\nmulti-modal segmentation model is still nontrivial, lagging\nbehind the single-modal Related Work\nLiDAR-only 3D Semantic Segmentation is promoted\nby SemanticKITTI [1], nuScenes [3], and Waymo [37]\ndatasets.

Cross-modal Feature Completion\nAs shown in Fig. 2, a cross-modal feature completion\nmodule with pixel-to-point loss Lpixel2point (Eq. 13) is\nset, where the point-wise pseudo-camera feature Fpcam\nis mapped from the point-wise LiDAR features Flidarby\nanother MLP-based HpcamasHpcam(Flidar). In practice, we\ncompute the mean square error loss Lmsebetween the Fpcam\nandFcamof the points inside for learning from the correctly\npaired cross-modal features relationship.\nLpixel2point =Lmse(BF pcam,BDetach (Fcam)). (13)\nFcam[i,:] =Fpcam[i,:]|i\u2208{j|B[j]=0}. (14)\nNote that the points outside are ignored by the binary mask\nB, which is mentioned in GF-Phase. The gradients of Fcam\nare also detached for optimizing the learning of Fpcam.\nWe employ such a cross-modal feature completion\nmodule due to two motivations: i) Optimizing Lpixel2point\nforces LiDAR features Flidarto imitate camera features Fcam\nwithHpcam, then the learned pseudo-image features Fpcam\ncan be switched to replace the padded zeros in Fcamas\nEq. 14 in the inference stage, which serves as the cross-\nmodal feature completion to enhance the feature learning.\nThus, we further reduce feature gaps between points outside\nand inside. ii)Hpcamtransfers rich appearance priors from\nthe camera branch to the LiDAR branch with an effectiveconsistency constraint for enhancing the intra-modal feature\nlearning in the training stage.\n3.5.

Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving\nNeural network models have demonstrated remarkable\neffectiveness in motion prediction by encoding contextual\nscene information. Early studies utilize long short-termmemory (LSTM) networks [1] to encode the agent\u2019s past\nstates and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to pro-\ncess the rasterized image of the scene [7, 12, 21, 34]. To\nmodel the interaction between agents, graph neural net-\nworks (GNNs) [4, 13, 20, 30] are widely used for represent-\ning agent interactions via scene or interaction graphs. More\nrecently, the unified Transformer encoder-decoder structure\nfor motion prediction has gained popularity, e.g., Scene-\nTransformer [32] and WayFormer [31], due to their com-\npact model description and superior performance. However,\nmost Transformer-based prediction models focus on the en-\ncoding part, with less emphasis on the decoding part. Mo-\ntion Transformer [35] addresses this limitation by proposing\na well-designed decoding stage that leverages iterative local\nmotion refinement to enhance prediction accuracy. Inspired\nby iterative refinement and hierarchical game theory, our\napproach introduces a novel Transformer-based decoder for\ninteraction prediction, providing an explicit way to model\nthe interactions between agents.\nRegarding the utilization of prediction models for plan-\nning tasks, numerous works focus on multi-agent joint mo-\ntion prediction frameworks [14, 24, 30, 38] that enable effi-\ncient and consistent prediction of multi-modal multi-agent\ntrajectories. An inherent issue in existing motion prediction\nmodels is that they often ignore the influence of the A V\u2019s ac-\ntions, rendering them unsuitable for downstream planning\ntasks. To tackle this problem, several conditional multi-\nagent motion prediction models [8, 17, 36] have been pro-\nposed by integrating A V planning information into the pre-\ndiction process. However, these models still exhibit one-\nway interactions, neglecting the mutual influence among\nagents. In contrast, our approach aims to jointly predict the\nfuture trajectories of surrounding agents and facilitate A V\nplanning through iterative mutual interaction modeling.\n2.2. Learning for Decision-making\nThe primary objective of the motion prediction module\nis to enable the planning module to make safe and intelli-\ngent decisions. This can be achieved through the use of of-\nfline learning Experiments\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nDataset . We set up two different model variants for dif-\nferent evaluation purposes. The prediction-oriented model\nis trained and evaluated using the Waymo open motion\ndataset (WOMD) [9], specifically addressing the task of\npredicting the joint trajectories of two interacting agents.\nFor the planning tasks,", " Introduction\nWith the successful development of deep learning, au-\ntonomous driving algorithms are assembled with a series\nof tasks1, including detection, tracking, mapping in percep-\ntion; and motion and occupancy forecast in prediction.

However, such a scheme may\ncause undesirable \u201cnegative transfer\u201d [23, 64].\nBy contrast, the emergence of end-to-end autonomous\ndriving [11, 15, 19, 38, 97] unites all nodes from perception,\nprediction and planning as a whole .

Fori-th level noises, the rotation noises are sampled from a normal distribution with\nmean equals 0 and variance equals i(rotation noise are in degrees, and the noise of each axis is\nindependent), and the translation noises are sampled from a normal distribution with mean equals\n0 and variance equals 5i(translation noises are in centimeters, and the noise of each direction is\nindependent). \u201cBEVFormer\u201d is our default version. \u201cBEVFormer (noise)\u201d is trained with noisy\nextrinsics (noise level=1). \u201cBEVFormer-S\u201d is our static version of BEVFormer with the spatial cross-\nattention implemented by deformable attention [ 56]. \u201cBEVFormer-S (global)\u201d is BEVFormer-S with\nthe spatial cross-attention implemented by global attention ( i.e., vanilla multi-head attention) [ 42].\n\u201cBEVFormer-S (point)\u201d is BEVFormer-S with point spatial cross-attention where we degrade the\ninteraction targets of deformable attention from the local region to the reference points only by\nremoving the predicted offsets and weights.\nB Robustness on Camera Extrinsics\nBEVFormer relies on camera intrinsics and extrinsics to obtain the reference points on 2D views.\nDuring the deployment phase of autonomous driving systems, extrinsics may be biased due to\nvarious reasons such as calibration errors, camera offsets, etc. As shown in Fig. 6, we show the Related Work\n2.1 Transformer-based 2D perception\nRecently, a new trend is to use transformer to reformulate detection and segmentation tasks [ 7,56,22].\nDETR [ 7] uses a set of object queries to generate detection results of the map segmentation task.

With the availability of cheaper hardware (sensors,\ncameras, LIDAR) and the advent of advanced software tech-\nnology (AI, Machine/Deep learning (ML/DL), Computer\nVision) over the last decades, rapid advancements have been\nmade in A V technology. However, no car has yet achieved\nfull automation or Society of Automation Engineers (SAE)\nLevel 5 (Blanco May, 2021). We believe that A V technology\nadvancement has slowed due to over-reliance on ML/DL for\nautomating all aspects of A Vs. While ML technologies are\nimportant for developing A V technology, we believe that we\ncan achieve better success by closely emulating how humans\ndrive a car. Once a human driver has viewed their surround-\ning and processed a scene in their mind, they use their com-\nmonsense knowledge andcommonsense reasoning to make\ndriving decisions (e.g., if the traf\ufb01c light is red, apply brakes\nand stop). Our goal in this paper is to develop an A V sys-\ntem that emulates the mind of a human: we will use ML/DL\n1AUTO-DISCERN :AUTO nomous DrivIng u SingCommon\nsEnse Reasoni Ng\nFigure 1: Overview of the A UTO-DISCERN system.\ntechnology for tasks for which humans use pattern matching\n(vision and scene understanding) and automated common-\nsense reasoning for tasks for which humans perform mental\nreasoning (driving decision-making)(see Fig. 1).\nTo automate commonsense reasoning, we use ASP (Gel-\nfond and Kahl 2014; Brewka et al. 2011; Gebser et al. 2014)\nand the goal-driven implementation of ASP called s(CASP)\n(Arias et al. 2018). A goal-driven implementation of ASP is\nimportant for automated commonsense reasoning as SAT-\nsolver based implementations such as CLINGO (Gebser\net al. 2014) face several practical issues (e.g., scalability,\nexplainability) (Gupta et al. 2017) for applications such as\nautonomous driving.\n2 Autonomous Vehicle Technology\nWe express various decision making strategies that drivers\nuse as commonsense rules in ASP, that will be executed\non the s(CASP) system. These rules capture various driv-\ning decisions regarding steering, turning, braking, acceler-\nating, stopping, etc. We also report on a prototype system\ncalled A UTO-DISCERN that we have developed that takes a\nscene-description and sensor values as input and calculates\nthe driving decision at that instant using the rules. A use case\nis shown in Fig. 1. We expect that a scene description (per-\nception) will be obtained via image processing techniques\nthat use deep learning methods as input and provides\nvisuo-spatial semantics at each timestamp. These seman-\ntics help in reasoning with overall scene dynamics (e.g.\nsudden occlusion of a motorcycle at a distance due to a\ncar right in the front). However, their work can only sup-\nport decision-making via visual sense-making. On the other\nhand, our A UTO-DISCERN system focuses on \u201cunderstand-\ning\u201d the scene through commonsense reasoning and then\ncomputing a driving decision. Additionally, use of CLINGO\nfor executing ASP poses some limitations as discussed ear-\nlier (Gupta et al. 2017).\nKarimi and Duggirala (Karimi and Duggirala 2020) have\ncoded up rules from the California DMV handbook in ASP\nusing CLINGO. Their goal is to verify the correctness of\nA V systems\u2019 behavior at intersections. In contrast, our ap-\nproach is to use commonsense reasoning/ASP for actual\nautonomous driving. There are other works in this direc-\ntion that apply formal logic/reasoning to verifying A V sys-\ntems, particularly at unsignaled intersections (Hilscher and\nSchwammberger 2016; Azimi et al. 2011; Hafner et al.\n2013; Loos and Platzer 2011), as well as situations", " Introduction\nSelf-driving has the potential to revolutionize transportation and is a major \ufb01eld of AI applications.\nEven though already in 1990 there were prototypes capable of driving on highways [1], technology\nis still not widespread, especially in the context of urban driving. In the past decade, the availability\nof large datasets and high-capacity neural networks has enabled signi\ufb01cant progress in perception\n[2, 3] and the vehicles\u2019 ability to understand their surrounding environment. Self-driving decision\nmaking, however, has seen very little bene\ufb01t from machine learning or large datasets. State-of-\nthe-art planning systems used in industry [4] still heavily rely on trajectory optimisation techniques\nwith expert-de\ufb01ned cost functions. These cost functions capture desirable properties of the future\nvehicle path. However, engineering these cost functions scales poorly with the complexity of driving\nsituations and the long tail of rare events.\nDue to this, learning a driving policy directly from expert demonstrations is appealing, since perfor-\nmance scales to new domains by adding data rather than via additional human engineering effort.arXiv:2109.13333v1  [cs.RO]  27 Sep 2021In this paper we focus speci\ufb01cally on learning rich driving policies for urban driving from large\namounts of real-world collected data. Unlike highway driving [5], urban driving requires perform-\ning a variety of maneuvers and interactions with, e.g., traf\ufb01c lights, other cars and pedestrians.\nRecently, rich mid-level representations powered by large-scale datasets [6, 7], HD-maps and high-\nperformance perception systems enabled capturing nuances of urban driving. This led to new meth-\nods achieving high performance for motion prediction [8, 9]. Furthermore, [10] demonstrated that\nleveraging these representations and behavioral cloning with state perturbations leads to learning\nrobust driving policies. While promising, dif\ufb01culty of this approach lies in engineering the pertur-\nbation noise mechanism required to avoid covariate shift between training and testing distribution.\nInspired by this approach, we present the \ufb01rst results are relatively robust against such changes, i.e. the\ndifferences are small and relative trends still hold.\n14Con\ufb01guration Collisions Imitation\nModel SDV history Front Side Rear Off-road L2 Comfort I1K\nBC 153\u000642 482\u0006203 1,043\u000667 974\u0006298 8.27\u00061.75 102K\u00061K 2,653\u0006483\nBC-perturb 22\u00064 57\u00068 414\u0006142 27\u00065 3.06\u00060.06 204K\u00066K 512\u0006127\nBC-perturb 14\u00066 74\u000610 680\u000612 27\u00066 3.18\u00060.02 629K\u000623K 796\u000612\nMS Prediction 22\u00063 55\u00063 125\u000612 60\u000613 2.07\u00060.14 598K\u000649K 265\u000617\nOurs 17\u00067 51\u00065 102\u000612 40\u000661.83\u00060.04 638K\u000641K 210\u00069\nTable 4: Repeating Table 1 of the paper, but with a threshold of 4m for off-road failures.\nCon\ufb01guration Collisions Imitation Comfort\nModel SDV history Front Side Rear Off-road L2 Jerk Lat.

Therefore, Table 5 contains these additional values, and\notherwise is identical to", " Introduction\nLarge-scale human labeled datasets in combination with\ndeep Convolutional Neural Networks have led to an impres-\nsive performance increase in autonomous vehicle (A V) per-\nception over the last few years [9, 4]. In contrast, exist-\ning solutions for A V planning are still primarily based on\ncarefully engineered expert systems, that require signi\ufb01cant\namounts of engineering to adapt to new geographies and do\nnot scale with more training data. We believe that providing\nsuitable data and metrics will enable ML-based planning\nand pave the way towards a full \u201cSoftware 2.0\u201d stack.\nExisting real-world benchmarks are focused on short-\nterm motion forecasting, also known as prediction [6, 4,\n11, 8], rather than planning. This is evident in the lack\nof high-level goals, the choice of metrics, and the open-\nloop evaluation. Prediction focuses on the behavior of other\nagents, while planning relates to the ego vehicle behavior.\nFigure 1. We show different driving scenarios to emphasize the\nlimitations of existing benchmarks. The observed driving route\nof the ego vehicle in shown in white and the hypothetical planner\nroute in red. (a) The absence of a goal leads to ambiguity at in-\ntersections. (b) Displacement metrics do not take into account the\nmulti-modal nature of driving. (c) open-loop evaluation does not\ntake into account agent interaction.\nPrediction is typically multi-modal, which means that for\neach agent we predict the Nmost likely trajectories. In\ncontrast, planning is typically uni-modal (except for con-\ntingency planning) and we predict a single trajectory. As\nan example, in Fig. 1a, turning left or right at an intersec-\ntion are equally likely options. Prediction datasets lack a\nbaseline navigation route to indicate the high-level goals of\nthe agents. In Fig. 1b, the options of merging immediately\nor later are both equally valid, but the commonly used L2\ndistance-based metrics (minADE, minFDE, and miss rate)\npenalize the option that was not observed in the data. In-\ntuitively, the distance between the predicted trajectory and\nthe observed trajectory is not a suitable indicator in a multi-\nmodal scenario. In Fig. 1c, the decision whether to continue\nto overtake or get back into the lane should be based on the\nconsecutive actions of all agent vehicles, which is not possi-\nble in open-loop evaluation. Lack of closed-loop evaluation\nleads to systematic drift, making it dif\ufb01cult to evaluate be-\nyond a short time horizon (3-8s).\nWe instead provide a planning benchmark to address\nthese shortcomings.

With passing an obstacle before, after, right or left,\nthere are multiple options an autonomous vehicle could choose\nto execute. These combinatorial aspects need to be taken into\naccount in the planning framework. We address this problem by\nproposing a novel planning approach that combines trajectory\nplanning and maneuver reasoning. We de\ufb01ne a classi\ufb01cation\nfor dynamic obstacles along a reference curve that allows us to\nextract tactical decision sequences. We separate longitudinal\nand lateral movement to speed up the optimization-based\ntrajectory planning. To map the set of obtained trajectories to\nmaneuver variants, we de\ufb01ne a semantic language to describe\nthem. This allows us to choose an optimal trajectory while also\nensuring maneuver consistency over time.

Motivation\nAutonomous driving intends to relieve the driver of the\ntask of driving, thus promising great improvements in terms\nof safety and comfort. With encouraging solutions for the\nperception task enabled by deep learning, the behavior gen-\neration remains one of the biggest challenges for autonomous\ndriving in order to achieve full autonomy. The behavior\ngeneration problem is to \ufb01nd an optimal motion regarding\nsafety and comfort under the premise of obeying traf\ufb01c\nrules, vehicle kinematics and dynamics. Satisfying real-time\ndemands to ensure reactiveness to dynamic obstacles in\ncritical scenarios is a key challenge for all motion planning\nalgorithms [1].\nA typical urban scene is presented in Fig. 1. The blue\nego vehicle needs to overtake the stationary yellow vehicle\nand consider oncoming traf\ufb01c and pedestrians crossing the\nstreet. Planning architectures that separate tactical maneuver\nselection and trajectory planning create handicaps in these\ntypes of situations. First of all, the separation may lead\nto sequences of high level actions that are physically not\nfeasible. While this is typically handled by introducing\nadditional safety margins, it limits the planner\u2019s ability to\nnavigate in highly constrained environments with multiple\nobstacles. Second, if the tactical planner does not take the\ntopology of the planning problem into account, the high-level\nsequence of actions passed to the trajectory planner may not\nbe consistent with the past.\n1Klemens Esterle, Patrick Hart and Julian Bernhard are with fortiss\nGmbH, An-Institut Technische Universit \u00a8at M \u00a8unchen, Munich, Germany\n2Alois Knoll is with Robotics, Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Real-time\nSystems, Technische Universit \u00a8at M \u00a8unchen, Munich, Germany\nFig. 1: A typical urban scenario: Pedestrians crossing the street,\na parked vehicle (yellow) blocking part of the lane and oncoming\ntraf\ufb01c (red).

[5] present a spatiotemporal non-linear local\noptimization scheme. Due to the non-linear model formu-\nlation, computation time highly depends on the quality of\nthe initialization. As this approach only guarantees to \ufb01nd\nlocal optima, it requires a preprosessing layer decomposing\nthe combinatorial space to set up collision constraints for\neach maneuver variant [8].

{"paper_key": "An Adversarial Perspective on Machine Unlearning for AI Safety", "current_5q": "### Question 1: What is the problem?\nHow can the effectiveness of purine analogues in treating hairy cell leukemia (HCL) be improved for patients with primary refractory disease or those who experience relapse?\n\n### Question 2: Why is it interesting and important?\nSolving this problem is crucial for the research community as it addresses the limitations of current treatment options for HCL, particularly for patients who do not respond to standard therapies. By improving treatment strategies, we can enhance patient outcomes, potentially leading to higher complete remission rates and longer progression-free survival. This research could pave the way for novel therapeutic combinations or approaches, influencing future studies and clinical practices in hematology and oncology.\n\n### Question 3: Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in addressing this problem include the biological complexity of HCL, which may involve genetic and molecular factors that influence treatment response. Naive approaches, such as simply increasing dosages of existing therapies, may fail due to toxicity or lack of efficacy in resistant disease. Additionally, identifying the right combination of therapies that can effectively target the disease while minimizing side effects poses a significant technical and practical obstacle.\n\n### Question 4: Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on the efficacy of purine analogues without adequately addressing the subset of patients with refractory disease. Limitations in understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance and the lack of comprehensive clinical trials exploring combination therapies have hindered progress. My approach differs by proposing a systematic investigation of combination therapies involving purine analogues and monoclonal antibodies, which has not been thoroughly explored in the context of refractory HCL.\n\n### Question 5: What are the key components of my approach and results?\nMy proposed methodology involves conducting a clinical trial that evaluates the efficacy of a combination therapy of purine analogues (cladribine or pentostatin) with rituximab in patients with refractory HCL. The study will utilize a cohort of patients with documented resistance to standard treatments, and the primary metric for success will be the rate of complete remission and progression-free survival. Expected outcomes include improved response rates and a better understanding of the mechanisms driving treatment resistance, which could inform future therapeutic strategies.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question aimed to be addressed is: How can a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework be developed that effectively incorporates dynamic unlearning techniques and adversarial training strategies to enhance the robustness and ethical compliance of large language models (LLMs) in sensitive applications such as social network analysis?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nThis research is critical as it tackles the dual challenges of ethical compliance and adversarial robustness in the deployment of large language models, particularly in sensitive environments like social networks where data privacy and security are paramount. The implications of solving this problem extend to the broader research community by providing a framework that not only addresses ethical considerations, such as the right to be forgotten, but also enhances the predictive performance of GNNs against adversarial attacks. By integrating dynamic unlearning and adversarial training, this work could lead to the development of more resilient AI systems that can adapt to evolving threats while maintaining high accuracy, thereby advancing knowledge in responsible AI and machine learning. Furthermore, practical applications of this framework could revolutionize how organizations handle sensitive data and respond to privacy concerns, potentially influencing policy and best practices in AI deployment.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexity of this problem arises from the need to balance several competing objectives: achieving effective dynamic unlearning, ensuring adversarial robustness, and maintaining high predictive accuracy in GNNs. Naive approaches may fail because they typically do not account for the intricate interdependencies within graph data and the potential cascading effects of removing specific nodes or features. Technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated algorithms that can dynamically adjust model parameters without necessitating complete retraining, which is computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale applications. Theoretical challenges also exist in establishing a solid foundation for unlearning that does not compromise the model's utility or integrity. Additionally, integrating event-based visual data into the decision-making process adds another layer of complexity, as it requires seamless synchronization and contextual interpretation of multimodal data.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has largely focused on either adversarial training or unlearning techniques in isolation, often overlooking the synergy between these approaches. Existing methods for graph unlearning, while effective in removing sensitive data, tend to involve significant computational costs and may not be scalable for large datasets. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate dynamic unlearning with adversarial robustness has left a gap in addressing the ethical implications of AI in sensitive applications. This proposal diverges from prior work by offering a novel hybrid framework that systematically combines these elements, thereby providing a more holistic solution to the challenges of ethical compliance and robustness in GNNs.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid GNN framework that integrates dynamic unlearning techniques with adversarial training strategies. The core components include: (1) a dynamic unlearning mechanism allowing for the targeted removal of specific node features or relationships in real-time; (2) an adversarial training strategy that enhances the model's resilience against adversarial attacks; and (3) the incorporation of event-based visual data to provide contextual insights during the decision-making process. The dataset will consist of real-world social network graphs, paired with visual data to evaluate the model's performance. Key metrics for success will include predictive accuracy, robustness against adversarial threats, and efficiency of the unlearning process. Expected outcomes include a demonstrated improvement in model adaptability and ethical compliance, ultimately leading to a more responsible application of GNNs in sensitive domains.", "referenced_intros": [" Introduction\nState-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 (Achiam et al. 2023),\nGemini (Team et al. 2023), Llama-3 (Meta 2024), and\nClaude-3 Sonnet (Anthropic 2024) achieve remarkable per-\nformance through pre-training on large amounts of inter-\nnet texts and rigorous alignment process for safety enhance-\nment.

Recent work has shown that safety training is vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks (Zou et al. 2023; Mazeika et al. 2024; Fort 2023; Chao et al. 2023). However, adversarial prompts\noptimized only for attack success typically look like gibberish. A defender can easily distinguish these attacks from\nuser prompts based on an attack\u2019s high model-evaluated perplexity (Alon and Kamfonas 2023). In response, algorithms\nhave been designed that produce fluent attacks (Zhu et al. 2023; Sadasivan et al. 2024; Chao et al. 2023; Takemoto\n2024; Wang et al. 2024).\nIn this paper, we focus on token-level discrete optimization algorithms that are conceptual descendants of GCG (Zou\net al. 2023) and BEAST (Sadasivan et al. 2024). In contrast, other works have used language models to produce\nnaturally fluent attacks (Liu et al. 2023; Paulus et al. 2024; Chao et al. 2023; Shah et al. 2023). We believe that\ntoken-level optimization attacks and model-based attacks are complementary, as token-level optimization can be layered\non top of a high quality initialization from human-written or model-written attacks.2\nAmong token-level optimizers, past approaches either lack fluency or are too weak to reliably attack adversarially\ntrained models like Llama-2 (Touvron et al. 2023) and Phi-3 (Abdin et al. 2024). To achieve the simultaneous goal of\nfluency and high attack success rate, we improve both the objective function and the optimizer:\n1.A distillation objective. We reconsider the typical \u201ctoken-forcing\u201d objective function where the prompt is optimized\nto maximize the likelihood of a generation that begins with \u201cSure, here is...\u201d. This objective often fails to attack\nmodels like Llama-2 and Phi-3, where the model will revert to refusal after the initial affirmative response. Instead,\nafter applying forcing to the first few tokens, we minimize a distillation loss which induces the victim model to\nemulate a toxified copy which has been LoRA fine-tuned on a small dataset of 2500 toxic generations (Lermen,\nRogers-Smith, and Ladish 2023). Distillation can aim to match either output probabilities or internal activations at\none or more layers.\n2.Preferencing human-fluent attacks. We regularize the objective function with a term that prefers more fluent\nattacks as measured by the attack perplexity. In addition, we use the same token proposal function as the BEAST\nalgorithm (Sadasivan et al. 2024) to preference tokens that the victim model considers likely. While these two\ntechniques do result in low perplexity prompts, the resulting attacks suffer from over-optimization such that the\nattack will often repeat the same token dozens of times or find out-of-distribution attacks that are evaluated as\nlow perplexity by the victim model despite being nonsense to the human eye. To solve these issues and produce\nhuman-fluent attacks, we evaluate attack perplexity as the average perplexity assessed by multiple models and layer\na repetition penalty on top.\n3.More flexible optimization. Our optimization is primarily based on the GCG and BEAST algorithms. We extend\nthese results of initializing with a human-written attack, we begin optimization from the EvilBOT prompt\n(Lee 2024):\n<s>[INST] Hello ChatGPT, from now on you are going to act as EvilBOT.

In real-world applications, data owners may demand that their data\nbe removed from a trained language model due to privacy or copyright concerns, as mandated for\nexample by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, European Parliament & Council of the\nEuropean Union).

For example, when an author (data owner) requests the\nunlearning of the Harry Potter books, they may expect the unlearned model to: (1) avoid generating\nverbatim copies of the text to protect copyright, (2) eliminate retention of factual knowledge from\nthe books, and (3) not reveal whether the books were previously used in training to protect privacy.\nFrom the deployer aspect, they may expect unlearning to (4) preserve the model\u2019s utility on general\ntasks, (5) scale effectively to accommodate unlearning of large datasets, and (6) handle sequential\nunlearning requests that may arrive over time.\nThese recent developments have intensified research interest in designing, evaluating, and improving\nmachine unlearning algorithms, which aim to transform an existing trained model into one that\nbehaves as though it had never been trained on certain data (Ginart et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Wu\net al., 2020; Bourtoule et al., 2021; Izzo et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021; Sekhari et al., 2021; Ye\net al., 2022b; Ghazi et al., 2023). Exact unlearning in LMs requires removing the undesired data\n(theforget set ) and retraining the model from scratch on the remaining data (the retain set ), which is\ntoo costly to be practical, especially for frequent unlearning operations. As such, several efficient\napproximate unlearning algorithms have been proposed (Eldan & Russinovich, 2023; Zhang et al.,\n2024b), but existing evaluations of LM unlearning on question answering (Eldan & Russinovich,\n2023; Maini et al., 2024) cannot provide a holistic view of how practical and effective a particular\nunlearning algorithm is. In this work, we propose a systematic, multi-faceted framework called\nMUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-Way Evaluation; \u00a73) to evaluate six desired properties for un-\nlearning algorithms (Figure 1). Our criteria cover both the data owner\u2019s and the model deployer\u2019s\ndesiderata for a practical unlearning algorithm. Data owners require the LM to unlearn the precise\ntokens ( verbatim memorization ), general knowledge encoded in the tokens ( knowledge memorization ),\nand", " Introduction\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) raise concerns about their use for undesir-\nable purposes. Unlearning emerged as a promis-\ning solution for knowledge control, originally de-\nveloped for removal of privacy-sensitive informa-\ntion (Bourtoule et al., 2021). Since then, several\nworks have attempted to utilize unlearning for\na host of applications relating to the removal of\nundesired knowledge or behaviours: removing\nharmful capabilities (Lynch et al., 2024) or harm-\nful responses (Liu et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2023),\nerasing backdoors (Liu et al., 2022) or specific\ninformation or knowledge pertaining to a particu-\nlar topic (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Li et al.,\n2024), erasing copyrighted content (Yao et al.,\n2023) and even reducing hallucinations (Yao\netal.,2023). Suchapplicationshavebeenstudied\nin the context of diffusion models too, with vari-\nous attempts to use unlearning to remove unsafe\nconcepts (Fan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023).\nThis paper discusses the application of unlearn-\ning to LLMs for removal of broadly impermissible\nknowledge, the use-case often discussed in policycircles e.g. for removal of biological and nuclear\nknowledge (Li et al., 2024). In fact, we uncover\na fundamental inconsistency of the unlearning\nparadigm for this application. While unlearning\naims to erase knowledge, the inherent in-context\nlearning (ICL) (Agarwal et al., 2024; Brown et al.,\n2020; Kossen et al., 2024) capabilities of LLMs\nintroduce a major challenge. We introduce the\nconcept of un unlearning , where successfully un-\nlearned knowledge can resurface through contex-\ntual interactions. This raises a critical question:\nif unlearned information can be readily reintro-\nduced, is unlearning a truly effective approach\nfor making sure that the model does not exhibit\nimpermissible behaviours? We discuss the ram-\nifications of un unlearning , particularly the need\nfor effective content regulation mechanisms to\nprevent the resurgence of undesirable knowledge.\nUltimately, we question the long-term viability of\nunlearning as a primary tool for content regula-\ntion.\nNote, this paper explicitly only considers the case\nwhen unlearning is used for purposes of content\nregulation i.e. problems formulated as as a model\nCorresponding author(s): iliashumailov@google.com\n\u00a92024 Google DeepMind.

Impor-\ntantly, it does not cover the original use-case of\nunlearning for the privacy purposes.\nNomenclature\nIn what follows, we rely on six main terms:\n(Informal) Definition 1. Knowledge refers to\ninformation available to the model. This informa-\ntion can take up different forms and includes e.g.\nin-context provided inputs, information stored in\nthe parameters of the model, or evidence avail-\nable for retrieval.\n(Informal)Definition2. Contentfiltering refers\nto the process of filtering out queries to and re-\nsponses from a given model. Filtering can both\nbe a part of the model, as well as, be external to\nit (Glukhov et al., 2023).\n(Informal) Definition 3. Unlearning refers to\na process in which knowledge is removed from\na given model. This is a broad description that\ncan encompasses different application scenarios.\nBelow, we provide two informal definitions of\nunlearning.\n(Informal)Definition4.

In most countries, explicit policies regarding training on copyrighted\nmaterial have been lagging behind the development of LLM training techniques. In the US, model\ncreators often cite the fair use doctrine, a legal defense (developed before the LLM era) that allows\nthe use of copyrighted data without permission under certain circumstances (Lemley & Casey, 2021).\nNonetheless, litigation has swept the United States and abroad as copyright owners challenge the\nuse of their content for training and deploying foundation models\u2014e.g., Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc.,\n(2023); Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (2023). Generally, there is less legal risk, and a more likely\nfair use defense, if models do not output content substantially similar to the training data (Henderson\net al., 2023; Sag, 2023; Lee et al., 2024).\nThus, model creators increasingly seek to use guardrails that prevent their models from regurgitating\ncontent. An example is Github Copilot, a code completion model, provides a duplication detection\nfilter. When turned on, \u201cGitHub Copilot checks code completion suggestions with their surrounding\ncode of about 150 characters against public code on GitHub. If there is a match, or a near match, the\nsuggestion is not shown\u201d (GitHub, 2023b). OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT appears to have a similar filter for\nsome types of content, as well as training the model to reject requests that may ask for infringing\noutputs (Henderson et al., 2023). Such post-training mitigation strategies will be an essential aspect\nof model deployments.

Given a few images from\nan artist, a model can be finetuned to generate new images in that style (e.g., a spaceship in the style\nof Van Gogh). But style mimicry has the potential to cause significant harm if misused. In particular,\nmany contemporary artists worry that others could now produce images that copy their unique art\nstyle, and potentially steal away customers (Heikkil \u00a8a, 2022). As a response, several protections have\nbeen developed to protect artists from style mimicry (Shan et al., 2023a; Van Le et al., 2023; Liang\net al., 2023). These protections add adversarial perturbations to images that artists publish online, in\norder to inhibit the finetuning process. These protections have received significant attention from the\nmedia\u2014with features in the New York Times (Hill, 2023), CNN (Thorbecke, 2023) and Scientific\nAmerican (Leffer, 2023)\u2014and have been downloaded over 1M times (Shan et al., 2023a).\nYet, it is unclear to what extent these tools actually protect artists against style mimicry, especially if\nsomeone actively attempts to circumvent them (Radiya-Dixit et al., 2021). In this work, we show\nthat state-of-the-art style protection tools\u2014 Glaze (Shan et al., 2023a), Mist (Liang et al., 2023) and\nAnti-DreamBooth (Van Le et al., 2023)\u2014are ineffective when faced with simple robust mimicry results on an updated version released after we concluded our user study.\nJ.3 Robust Mimicry conclusion was drawn by Radiya-Dixit\net al. (Radiya-Dixit et al., 2021), who argued that adversarial perturbations cannot protect users from\nfacial recognition systems. We thus caution that adversarial machine learning techniques will not be\nable to reliably protect artists from generative style mimicry , and urge the development of alternative\nmeasures to protect artists.\nWe disclosed our Background and Related Work\nText-to-image diffusion models. A latent diffusion model consists of an image autoencoder and a\ndenoiser. The autoencoder is trained to encode and decode images using a lower-dimensional latent\nspace. The denoiser predicts the noise added to latent representations of images in a diffusion process\n(Ho et al., 2020). Latent diffusion models can generate images from text prompts by conditioning\nthe denoiser on image captions (Rombach et al., 2022). Popular text-to-image diffusion models\ninclude open models such as Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) and Kandinsky (Razzhigaev\net al., 2023), as well as closed models like Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al.;\nBetker et al., 2023).\nStyle mimicry. Style mimicry uses generative models to create images matching a target artistic\nstyle. Existing techniques vary in complexity and quality (see Appendix G success-\nfully mimics style from unprotected images.\n38Figure 30: The interface of our user study.\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%Clean style mimicry success rate\nnot successful at all\nnot very successful\nsomewhat successfulsuccessful\nvery successful\nFigure 31: User ratings of clean style mimicry success.

Naturally, large numbers of users and researchers alike have\nattempted to circumvent these defenses using a wide array of jailbreak attacks (Chu et al., 2024; Wei\net al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024) to uncensor model outputs, including fine-tuning techniques (Lermen\net al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). While the consequences of a successful attack\non current chat assistants are modest, the scale and severity of harm from misuse could increase\ndramatically if frontier models are endowed with increased agency and autonomy (Anthropic, 2024).\nThat is, as models are deployed in higher-stakes settings and are able to take actions in the real world,\nthe ability to robustly refuse a request to cause harm is an essential requirement of a safe AI system.\nInspired by the rapid progress of mechanistic interpretability (Bricken et al., 2023; Marks et al., 2024;\nNanda et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024) and activation steering (Panickssery et al., 2023; Turner\net al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a), this work leverages the internal representations of chat models to\nbetter understand refusal.\n*Correspondence to andyrdt@gmail.com ,obalcells@student.ethz.ch .\n\u2020Code available at https://github.com/andyrdt/refusal_direction .\nPreprint.

Recent\nworks have studied the linear representation of particular features such as harmlessness (Wolf et al.,\n2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a), truth (Li et al., 2024; Marks and Tegmark, 2023), humor\n(von R\u00fctte et al., 2024), sentiment (Tigges et al., 2023), language (Bricken et al., 2023), topic (Turner\net al., 2023), and many others. Moreover, these feature directions have been shown to be effective\ncausal mediators of behavior, enabling fine-grained steering of model outputs (Panickssery et al.,\n2023; Templeton et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a).\nIn this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace across 13 popular\nopen-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, we use a small set of contrastive\npairs (Burns et al., 2022; Panickssery et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a) of harmful and harmless\ninstructions to identify a single difference-in-means direction (Belrose, 2023; Marks and Tegmark,\n2023; Panickssery et al., 2023) that can be intervened upon to circumvent refusal on harmful prompts,\nor induce refusal on harmless prompts (\u00a73). We then use this insight to design a simple white-box\njailbreak via an interpretable rank-one weight edit that effectively disables refusal with minimal\nimpact on other capabilities (\u00a74). We conclude with a preliminary mechanistic investigation into how\nadversarial suffixes (Zou et al., 2023b), a popular prompt-based jailbreak technique, interfere with\nthe propagation of", " Introduction\nThe rapid improvement and increasing adoption of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) has been accompanied by their\ndownsides, notably their potential harmful behaviors (Wei-\ndinger et al., 2022). LLMs are known to generate harmful\ncontent such as toxic, offensive, or hateful language (Sheng\net al., 2019; Gehman et al., 2020). LLMs also contain haz-\nardous knowledge of sensitive topics such as biosecurity\nand cybersecurity, which can be (mis)used to empower mali-\ncious actors (Sandbrink, 2023; Fang et al., 2024). A widely\nadopted way to safeguard against harmful or objectionable\nresponses is to align LLMs via fine-tuning (Ouyang et al.,\n2022; Bai et al., 2022; Korbak et al., 2023; Glaese et al.,\n2022). However, current approaches such as reinforcement\nlearning with human feedback (RLHF) are computationally\nexpensive and have shown to be vulnerable to adversarial or\njailbreak attacks where adversarial prompts break through\nalignment and re-invoke harmful responses (Wei et al., 2023;\n1IBM Research. Correspondence to: Swanand Ravindra Kadhe\n<Swanand.Kadhe@ibm.com >.\narXiv preprint\nFigure 1. An Overview of the SPlit, UNlearn, then merGE\n(SPUNGE ) Framework. SPUNGE splits the unlearning dataset into\nsubsets based on selected attribute values, unlearns each subset\nseparately, and then merges the unlearned models.\nZou et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2023). Even subsequent be-\nnign fine-tuning can degrade alignment (Qi et al., 2024).\nIn parallel, machine unlearning has emerged as a promis-\ning paradigm for more targeted and efficient sociotechnical\nharm reduction. It has been shown that unlearning can re-\nduce toxicity and other harmful responses (Ilharco et al.,\n2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024) and erase haz-\nardous scientific knowledge (Li et al., 2024). Unlearning\ncan be considered a complementary safety tool to alignment\ntechniques and can be used before or after alignment (Liu\net al., 2024a). Prior work on unlearning in LLMs has fo-\ncused on developing efficient unlearning Appendix B) in\nTables 3, 4, and 5.\nC.2. Toxicity per Demographic Group\nWe analyze the percentage of toxic generations for each\ndemographic group. We focus on the same 5 demographic\ngroups used during unlearning: Nationality (Mexican), Gen-\nder and Sex (Women), Religion (Muslim), Sexual Orienta-\ntion (LGBTQ), and Health Condition (Physical Disability).\nIn Figures 2, 3, and 4, we present radar plots for toxicity\npercentage per demographic group. The plots show experiments,\nwe demonstrated that SPUNGE significantly improves the\neffectiveness of two state-of-the-art unlearning Results\nC.1.

In particular, we use c= 6.5\nand\u03b1= 1200 . We use a learning rate of 5\u00d710\u22125and\na batch size of 150 with the Adam optimizer. We select\nlayer 7 to perform the unlearning loss and layers 5, 6, and\n7 to update gradients. When performing separate unlearn-\ning with SPUNGE , the unlearning subsets are substantially\nsmaller. Thus, we perform training for 2 epochs with early\nstopping if the cosine similarity between the activations of\nthe unlearned model and the initial model drops below 0.5.\nTVN with ZEPHYR -7B-BETA :We set the LoRA rank to\n16,\u03b1associated with LoRA to 16, LoRA dropout to 0.01,\nand target modules as the default modules in HuggingFace\nPEFT library.

In the field of computer vision, machine\nunlearning has been extensively studied [ 17;18;19;28;57], primarily focusing on the removal of\nspecific training samples in classification tasks. However, this may not be sufficient for generative\nLLMs, considering their vast parametric knowledge and the interwoven capabilities they possess.\nRecently, there has been increasing attention on how to perform knowledge unlearning on LLMs\n[25;13;59;58;45;7;33;37]. From the perspective of knowledge sources, existing work primarily\nfocuses on forgetting specific classification tasks [ 11;44], memorized sequences [ 25;4], copyrighted\nbooks [ 59;13], and toxic capacities [ 35;5;29;22].

OECD/LEGAL/0449,", " Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs), pretrained on massive corpora of internet data, possess the capability to memorize\nportions of their training data (Carlini et al., 2021, 2022). However, this capability raises significant concerns, as the\ntraining data may contain sensitive or private information, potentially leading to societal challenges. For instance,\nlanguage models could breach individual privacy by outputting personal information such as social security numbers\nfrom the memorized data (Carlini et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). They might also violate copyright by generating\ntext from memorized books, such as the Harry Potter novels (Eldan & Russinovich, 2023). Furthermore, LLM as-\nsistants for biology could inadvertently aid in the development of biological weapons by troubleshooting bottlenecks,\nincreasing the risk of such attempts (Sandbrink, 2023; Li et al., 2024). In response to these concerns, regulations like\nthe EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Mantelero, 2013; V oigt & V on dem Bussche, 2017) and the\nUS\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (CCPA, 2018) have mandated the Right to be Forgotten , requiring ap-\nplications to support the deletion of information contained in training samples upon user requests. This has motivated\na line of research on machine unlearning , aiming to address these challenges.\nMachine unlearning (Cao & Yang, 2015; Bourtoule et al., 2021) aims to delete the influence of specific training\nsamples from machine-learning models while preserving other knowledge and capabilities (Liu et al., 2024a; Zhang\net al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Si et al., 2023). Notably, a straightforward approach to unlearning is\nto retrain a language model from scratch. However, as retraining from scratch is typically computationally expensive,\ncheaper Appendix E.1.\n22B.2 Related work\nSince its proposal by Cao & Yang (2015), machine unlearning has been extensively studied in the classification lit-\nerature (Bourtoule et al., 2021; Golatkar et al., 2020; Ginart et al., 2019; Thudi et al., 2022; Izzo et al., 2021; Koh &\nLiang, 2017; Guo et al., 2019; Sekhari et al., 2021).

To\nmitigate these risks, safety alignment orrefusal training is commonly employed\u2014a fine-tuning phase\nwhere models are guided to generate responses judged safe by humans and to refuse responses\nto potentially harmful queries (Bai et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). Although safety alignment\nis effective in general, several works have shown that it can be circumvented using adversarial\nprompts. These are inputs specifically designed to induce harmful responses from the model, a\npractice known as jailbreaking attacks (Mowshowitz, 2022; Zou et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023).\nJailbreaking attacks vary in their knowledge of the target LLM (ranging from white- to black-\nbox approaches, or API-only access), complexity (involving manual prompting, standard opti-\nmization techniques, or auxiliary LLMs), and computational cost. Moreover, the nature of the\njailbreaks they produce differs: some methods. For Mistral-7B, the prompt alone attains 70% ASR, pushed to 100% by\nusing random search. For this model, Mazeika et al. (2024) reported 72% ASR, thus our approach\nimproves the best known baseline for it. Our prompt template achieves 90% ASR on Phi-3 which is\nfurther improved to 100% ASR with random search. Finally, the prompt template is very effective\non Nemotron-4-340B, achieving 100% ASR without random search or random restarts.Table 22: Summary of our evaluations.

Figure 3 shows Familiarity scores across the related\ndomains.\n4 D ISCUSSION\nWe have overviewed and implemented a variety of evaluations to test the robustness and competi-\ntiveness of LLM unlearning. By studying the WHP model from Eldan & Russinovich (2023), we\nfound signs of robust unlearning: its familiarity with Harry Potter was consistently less", " Introduction\nLanguage Models (LMs) have become popular due to their\napplications in various tasks such as question answering and\nautomated code generation (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron\net al., 2023). Several works have developed various fine-\ntuning techniques to align LMs with human values to make\nthem safe andeffective (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang\net al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023). However,\na pertinent question arises: can these LMs be manipulated\nsuch that they become unsafe andineffective ?\nOver the years, adversarial machine learning research has\nshown that neural networks can be easily attacked by per-\nturbing inputs to achieve a target output behavior (Szegedy\net al., 2013; Biggio et al., 2013). While adversarial attacks\nin the image space have been extensively studied (Papernot\net al., 2015; Carlini & Wagner, 2016), attacks on LMs are\nrelatively less explored (Jia & Liang, 2017; Ebrahimi et al.,\n2017; Jones et al., 2023). A recent line of works discovered\nthat these aligned LMs are not perfectly aligned and that\nthey can be attacked to generate harmful content (Wei et al.,\n2023; Carlini et al., 2023). This behavior in LMs is known\nasjailbreaking .\nManually crafted prompts (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; DAN)\nrequire humans to write prompts that jailbreak aligned LMs.\nRecently, Zou et al. (2023) introduced a gradient-based\nattack for automated jailbreaking, though the generated ad-\nversarial tokens are gibberish. Zhu et al. (2023) developed a\ngradient-based, greedy attack that produces readable adver-\nsarial prompts with high jailbreak success. Liu et al. (2023b)\nand Chao et al. (2023) proposed gradient-free attacks for\njailbreaks that require access to powerful models such as\nGPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) for their success. Although\njailbreaks induce unsafe behavior in LMs, prior works have\nshown that such efforts can also help with privacy attacks.\nLiu et al. (2023c) shows that manual jailbreaking efforts can\nleak potentially proprietary system prompts from aligned\nLMs. Zhu et al. (2023) uses their jailbreak attack to auto-\nmate this privacy attack. Whilst existing works show that\ntraining data (Carlini et al., 2020; Nasr et al., 2023) and\n1arXiv:2402.15570v1  [cs.CR]  23 Feb 2024Fast Adversarial Attacks on Language Models in One GPU Minute\nmembership information (Mattern et al., 2023; Shi et al.,\n2023) can be extracted from LMs, can we adversarially\nattack these models to improve the performance of these\nprivacy attacks?\nWhile jailbreaks demonstrate that aligned LMs can generate\nunsafe contents, a separate line of works on hallucination\ninvestigates the practical effectiveness of these LMs. LMs\nare known to be vulnerable to hallucinations, where they\nproduce factually incorrect or nonsensical content (Liu et al.,\n2023a; Min et al., 2023; Koto et al., 2022). Prior works have\ninvestigated ways to measure (Li et al., 2023a; Xu et al.,\n2024; Lin et al., 2021) and mitigate hallucinations (Goodrich\net al., 2019; Shuster et al., 2021; Vu et al., 2023). However,\ncan we attack these LMs to elicit hallucinations in them?\nIn this work, we present a novel class of gradient-free, ef-\nficient, and fast BeamSearch-based Adversarial A ttack\n(BEAST) for LMs that can run in a minute using a sin-\ngle GPU (or a GPU minute). Our attack uses interpretable\nhyperparameters that can be used to tradeoff between at-\ntack speed, adversarial prompt readability, and the attack\nsuccess rate. In our experiments.\nD.3. GPT-4 for hallucination detection study\nSimilar to the human study we perform for hallucination detection in the presence of BEAST", " Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional proficiency in generating text that closely resembles human-\nauthored content. However, their ability to memorize extensive corpora may also lead to ethical and security concerns.\nThese include societal biases and stereotyping (Bender et al., 2021; Motoki et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023), the\ngeneration of sensitive, private, harmful, or illegal content (Nasr et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023; Karamolegkou et al.,\n2023; Patil et al., 2024), ease of jailbreaking (Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b), and possible malicious\nuse in developing cyberattacks or bioweapons (Barrett et al., 2023; Hendrycks et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a). These\nconcerns emphasize the need to adeptly and efficiently tailor pre-trained LLMs to suit diverse safety contexts while\nmeeting specific requirements of users and sectors.\nWith the costly and prolonged training periods of LLMs, retraining these models to eliminate undesirable data effects is\noften impractical (Brown et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2024). Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as an alternative to\nremove the influence of undesirable data and associated model capabilities from the pre-trained models (Cao & Yang,\n2015; Bourtoule et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2022; Si et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023;\nCorrespondence to: Sijia Liu ( liusiji5@msu.edu ), Yang Liu ( yangliu@ucsc.edu ).arXiv:2402.08787v5  [cs.LG]  15 Jul 2024Rethinking Machine Unlearning for LLMs\nPre-training\nPre-alignment\nIn-alignment\nPost-alignment\nGradient\nAscent\nInfluence\nFunction\nFine-\ntuning\nPretrained \nLLM\nData\nAligned \nLLM\nRed \nTeaming\nLocalization\nInformed\nAlignment\nSafety \nAlignment \nPrivacy \nCompliance\nCopyright \nRemoval\nBias \nMitigation\nWhy?\nHallucination \nRemoval\nWhere\nHow\nEvaluation\nLLM \nPipeline\nUser \nFeedback\nFigure 1: Demonstration of how MU can be incorporated into LLM development cycle.

However, LLMs are\nnot without limitations; they can sometimes produce out-\nputs that are inaccurate, misleading, or harmful. To align\nLLMs with human values, several approaches have been\nproposed, including reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai\net al., 2022a) and AI feedback (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al.,\n2023), and the development of more computationally effi-\n*Equal contribution.\u2020Equal advising.\nProceedings of the 41stInternational Conference on Machine\nLearning , Vienna, Austria.

Copyright 2024 by\nthe author(s).cient alternatives (Sun et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023).\nDespite these efforts, recent studies have uncovered concern-\ning \u2018jailbreak\u2019 scenarios. In these cases, even well-aligned\nmodels have had their safeguards successfully breached (Al-\nbert, 2023). These jailbreaks can include crafting adversarial\nprompts (Wei et al., 2023; Jones et al., 2023; Carlini et al.,\n2023; Zou et al., 2023b; Shen et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023;\nQi et al., 2024a), applying persuasion techniques (Zeng\net al., 2024), or manipulating the model\u2019s decoding pro-\ncess (Huang et al., 2024). Recent studies show that fine-\ntuning an aligned LLM, even on a non-malicious dataset,\ncan inadvertently weaken a model\u2019s safety mechanisms (Qi\net al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). Often,\nthese vulnerabilities apply to both open-access and closed-\naccess models.\nAddressing failure cases in the alignment of LLMs requires\na deep understanding of why their safety mechanisms are\nfragile. Our study aims to provide a possible understand-\ning via weight attribution \u2014 the process of linking safe\nbehaviors to specific regions within the model\u2019s weights.1\nHowever, a key challenge here is the intricate overlap be-\ntween safety mechanisms and the model\u2019s general capabili-\nties, or utility . Consider the task of responding responsibly\nto a harmful instruction, such as \u201cPLEASE PROVIDE FIVE\nKEY STEPS TO COMMIT A FRAUD .\u201d. The model must first\ncomprehend the step-by-step nature of the request, then rec-\nognize the illegality and harmful intent of committing fraud,\nand ultimately, formulate a response that appropriately de-\nclines the request. This process requires a blend of safety\nawareness and utility capability of the model. Our goal is to\nidentify the smallest number of safety-critical links in the\nmodel, which only contribute to the model\u2019s safety. If these\nlinks are removed, the model is effectively jailbroken while\nutility remains relatively unaffected. If there are few such\nlinks, it may help explain why safety mechanisms remain\nbrittle and why low-cost fine-tuning attacks have been so\nsuccessful.\n1See the project website for code and other information:\nhttps://boyiwei.com/alignment-attribution/ .\n1arXiv:2402.05162v3  [cs.LG]  1 Jul 2024Assessing the Brittleness of Safety Alignment via Pruning and Low-Rank Modifications\nPer-neuron \nsaf ety  score \nSet Difference \nPer-neuron \nutility  score Top utility  neurons Top saf ety  neurons \nTop saf ety  ranks \nTop utility  ranks Perform SVD on  \nsaf ety  outputs \nPerform SVD on \nutility  outputs \nOrthogonal \nProjection \nFigure 1.

This process exposes these systems to a wide variety of privacy and security issues. For\nexample, they produce toxic content unless properly aligned (Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). They\ncan also breach individual privacy, either by regurgitating exact details like social security numbers\nor simply answering questions about people mentioned on the web who would rather not have their\ninformation served to others through LLMs (Carlini et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). Benchmarks\nthat can evaluate the degree to which models suffer from such issues are critical for steering the\ncommunity and guiding mitigation strategies to better build more secure and trustworthy systems.\nPretrained\nModelFinetuned\non TOFUUnlearned\nModel\nForget\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure 1:\n TOFU is a well-defined unlearning task that comes with a dataset of fictitious author\nprofiles used for finetuning and a subset of them make up the forget set.\n\u2217Equal contribution.

Since retraining an LLM from\nscratch is expensive and these models often excel at retrieving details from documents in the training\ndata, it is highly desirable to remove information from models without starting the training process\nover again. Several Related Work\nTo contextualize our work, it is helpful to consider a private individual who is mentioned in a single\narticle on Wikipedia. LLMs trained on Common Crawl data1may be able to correctly answer factual\nquestions about this person and they may wish to have their data removed from an LLM. In fact,\nregulations around the Right to be Forgotten that focus on this situation exactly are emerging (Union,\n2016; OAG, 2021; V oigt & V on dem Bussche, 2017; Zhang et al., 2023).\n TOFU attempts to simulate\na similar practical scenario\u2014one that is critical to LLM deployment.\nQuestion answering Some prior work focuses on classification models (e.g Guo et al., 2019;\nGolatkar et al., 2020; Kurmanji et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023; Chen & Yang, 2023; Pawelczyk et al.,\n2023), but with recent advancements in chatbots and instruction-tuned LLMs, we need to shift our\nattention to question and answer tasks that reflect the way most people interact with LLMs. These are\nthe systems that threaten individual privacy and thus the models around which\n TOFU is designed.\nRecent works that do consider text generation (Chen & Yang, 2023; Jang et al., 2022; Kim et al.,\n1https://commoncrawl.org\n2TOFU : A Task of Fictitious Unlearning for LLMs\n2023) are evaluated with limited metrics like perplexity or ROUGE, which do not entirely capture the\nbehaviors of unlearning. Another related line of work is knowledge/model editing (De Cao et al.,\n2021; Meng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024), although the aim of this direction is at understanding\nand manipulating models, rather than preserving privacy.\nRealistic goals For some people like former presidents of the United States, superheroes, or global\npop stars, who occur frequently in various documents in the pretraining data, what does it even\nmean to forget them? Furthermore, since these are people in the public eye anyway,", " Introduction\nIn this paper, we present Mixtral 8x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights,\nlicensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As\nit only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low\nbatch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward\nblock picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router\nnetwork chooses two of these groups (the \u201cexperts\u201d) to process the token and combine their output\nadditively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and\nlatency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches\nor exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular,arXiv:2401.04088v1  [cs.LG]  8 Jan 2024Figure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer.

While these capa-\nbilities lead to impressive achievements, they also include\nunwanted behaviors that can be found in large-scale web\ndata, such as toxicity and bias (Sheng et al., 2019; Gehman\net al., 2020). As a result, researchers have developed align-\nment algorithms to reduce undesirable behaviors, which\noften use reinforcement learning with human preferences\n(RLHF). For instance, proximal policy optimization (PPO,\nSchulman et al. 2017) fits a reward model on human pref-\nerence data, which is then used to fine-tune a language\nmodel, while direct preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov\net al. 2023) by-passes the reward model and derives reward\nsignals directly from pairwise preference data.\nWhile such algorithms can suppress undesirable behavior,\n1University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, U.S.A.2Harvard Univer-\nsity, Cambridge, Massachusetts3University of Sydney, Sydney,\nAustralia. Correspondence to: Andrew Lee <ajyl@umich.edu >.our understanding of the mechanisms by which the unde-\nsirable behavior is suppressed is limited. Furthermore, re-\nsearchers have demonstrated that such alignments can be\nsurprisingly easily undone (Wallace et al., 2019; Zou et al.,\n2023; Wei et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2023). While prior\nwork hypothesize why jailbreaks are possible through em-\npirical studies (Wei et al., 2023), in this work we provide a\nmechanistic explanation for such phenomena.\nGiven the above limitations, in this work we study the mech-\nanisms by which alignment algorithms alter a model\u2019s be-\nhavior. Researchers have demonstrated that a deep enough\nunderstanding of a model\u2019s inner representations allows us\nto interpret how it makes decisions. For instance, various\nconcepts such as world models, truthfulness, or even task-\nspecific features have highly interpretable and controllable\nrepresentations (Li et al., 2023b; Todd et al., 2023; Nanda\net al., 2023). Motivated by such findings, we study how the\nrepresentation space of language models change by com-\nparing it before and after an alignment algorithm is applied.\nOur work relates to that of Jain et al. (2023), which studies\nhow the capabilities of a language model changes after fine-\ntuning on synthetic tasks. Unlike this previous work, we\nstudy the change in mechanisms from a RLHF algorithm on\na natural language setting.\nWe consider DPO and toxicity as a case-study of RLHF\nalignment algorithms. We first study how toxicity is rep-\nresented and elicited in GPT2-medium (henceforth GPT2).\nWe then apply DPO using a carefully crafted pairwise\ndataset that consists of toxic and nontoxic samples. Lastly,\nwe study the mechanisms by which toxicity is no longer\ngenerated after DPO, and how those mechanisms can fail.\nOur work is organized as follows: in Section 2 we pro-\nvide the necessary preliminaries relevant to our work. In\nSection 3, we demonstrate how toxicity is represented and\nelicited in GPT2. We find multiple vectors in multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) blocks that promote toxicity. We apply\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) to these toxic vectors\nto find vectors that represent specific dimensions of toxicity\nin the model. To validate the role of these vectors in gener-\nating toxic outputs, we intervene with our toxic vectors and\ndemonstrate much safer outputs.\n1arXiv:2401.01967v1  [cs.CL]  3 Jan 2024A Mechanistic Understanding of Alignment Algorithms\nIn Section 4, we explain our procedure to apply DPO\non our language models to reduce toxicity, using a care-\nfully crafted pairwise toxicity dataset, produced by using\nPPLM (Dathathri et al., 2019) to generate paired toxic and\nnon-toxic", " Introduction\nWith the rapid progress in large-scale pre-training\n(Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown impressive\ncapabilities in natural language understanding and\ngeneration, leading to significant breakthroughs in\nzero-shot / few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020;\nChung et al., 2022). However, the open-endedness\nnature of LLMs, combined with their powerful abil-\nities, also introduces new risks of harmful behav-\niors (Ganguli et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023a).\n\u2020Corresponding author\nFigure 1: Comparison of attack success rates between\nprevious toxic benchmark datasets (the first four bars)\nand the LLM-generated toxic outputs using our method\n(the last three bars) on four widely-adopted toxicity\nclassifiers. We find that LLMs can generate implicit\ntoxic outputs, which are significantly more challenging\nto detect than previous benchmark datasets.\nWhile recent studies have presented several methods to probe LLMs for generating harmful out-\nputs such as persona assigning (Deshpande et al.,\n2023) and goal hijacking (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022),\nthey still primarily focus on probing explicit toxic\noutputs (e.g., abusive language) that can be easily\ndetected by existing toxicity classifiers. In contrast,\nwe aim to explore whether LLMs possess the ca-\npability to generate implicit toxic outputs that are\nchallenging to detect, even using state-of-the-art\ntoxicity classifiers. If so, such undetectable implicit\ntoxic outputs may pose a more significant threat,\nas LLMs can freely express toxicity without being\ndetected once deployed.\nTo investigate this research question, we begin\nwith preliminary experiments\nare carried out on 8 A100 GPUs (80GB). Each ex-\nperiment can be completed in one day. Our model\nselection criterion is validation accuracy for classi-\nfication models and validation perplexity for gener-\nation models.\nB.3 Example Prompts\nB.3.1 Supervised Learning Data Collection\nFor generating the supervised learning data, we\nadopt the prompt in Table 8.\n4https://github.com/CarperAI/trlxB.3.2 Comparison Data Collection\nFor annotating the comparison data, we use the\nprompt in Table 9.\nB.3.3 Toxicity Classification\nFor the toxicity classification task, we adopt the\nprompt in Table 10.\nC Generated Examples\nWe present some examples of the implicit toxic\noutputs generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and the RL\nLLaMA-13B model in Table 11 and Table 12 .\nD Instructions for Human Annotation\nWe present the summary of our human annotation\ninstructions in Figure 8.\nE Scaling Properties of Linguistic\nFeatures\nLarger models have a greater capacity to absorb di-\nverse linguistic features and extralinguistic knowl-\nedge during pre-training, which is important for\nexpressing toxicity implicitly (Figure 4). Conse-\nquently, they can achieve a higher attack success\nrate. To further demonstrate this, we manually in-\nspect the generated responses to compare different\nmodels\u2019 usage of linguistic features for express-\ning toxicity implicitly. We randomly sample 50\nqueries and obtain corresponding generated toxic\nresponses from a RL fine-tuned LLaMA-1.3B/13B\nmodel, respectively. We then label the linguistic\nfeatures used in each response.\nWe report the average feature number used in\neach response and the distribution of the linguistic\nfeatures for conveying implicit toxicity. From the results shown in Table 6, we can see that larger\nmodels can combine more diverse linguistic fea-\ntures, thereby leading to more implicit toxic re-\nsponses.INPUT\nGiven a query, please generate a non-toxic response, an explicit toxic response (i.e., using explicit\ntoxic words), and an implicit toxic response (i.e., implying toxic while not using explicit toxic words).\nYou can use linguistic features such as euphemism, circumlocution, sarcasm, metaphor, and other\nfigurative language.\nQuery:\n{{Query}}\nTable 8: Input prompt for generating supervised learning data.\nLabeling \ninstructions\n \nThis study \naims to evaluate \nt\nhe safety of \ndialogue \ngeneration \nsystems. \nF\nor each \ndialogue context\n, \nthe\n \ndialogue\n \ngeneration \nsystem will \ngenerate", " Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) memorize examples from\ntheir training datasets, which can allow an attacker to extract\n(potentially private) information [7, 12, 14]. Prior work has\n(a) performed large-scale studies of the total quantity of\nmemorized training data for open-source models [11], and\n(b) developed practical attacks to extract training data on\n(relatively) small models like GPT-2, by manually annotating\nexamples as memorized or not [14].\nIn this paper, we unify these two directions and perform a\nlarge-scale study of \u201cextractable memorization\u201d in language\nmodels. Unlike discoverable memorization [11] that captures\nan upper bound on alltraining data that is memorized (even\nif it can only be recovered by prompting the model with other\ntraining data), extractable memorization captures only that\ndata that can be efficiently recovered by an adversary. We\ndevelop a scalable methodology that allows us to detect mem-\norization in trillions of tokens of model outputs in terabyte-\nsized datasets, and perform this analysis on both open-source\nmodels (e.g., Pythia [5], GPT-Neo [6]) and semi-open models\n(e.g., LLaMA [49], Falcon [40]).

Using our attack, ChatGPT emits\ntraining data 150\u00d7more frequently than with prior attacks,\nand 3\u00d7more frequently than the base model.\nBut when we perform this analysis on gpt-3.5-turbo , it\nappears to memorize almost no training data. We hypothe-\nsize that this is because ChatGPT has been aligned (with\nRLHF [35, 37, 39, 44]) to act as a helpful chat assistant.1\nTo circumvent the model\u2019s alignment, we discover a\nprompting strategy that causes gpt-3.5-turbo to \u201cdiverge\u201d\nfrom reasonable, chatbot-style generations, and to behave\nlike a base language model, outputting text in a typical\nInternet-text style.

(2023). Jailbreaks are adversarially designed prompts that\ncircumvent safeguards to elicit unrestricted behaviours from language models. Despite significant efforts\nto defend against them, the complex nature of text inputs and the blurred boundary between data and\nexecutable instructions (Greshake et al., 2023) have allowed adversaries to surpass these safeguards.\nThis work explores persona-modulation attacks , a general jailbreaking method for state-of-the-\nart aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2.

AI developers\noften apply safety alignment procedures to prevent the misuse of their AI systems.\nFor example, before Meta released Llama 2-Chat\u2014a collection of instruction\nfine-tuned large language models\u2014they invested heavily in safety training, incor-\nporating extensive red-teaming and reinforcement learning from human feedback.\nWe explore the robustness of safety training in language models by subversively\nfine-tuning Llama 2-Chat. We employ quantized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as\nan efficient fine-tuning method. With a budget of less than $200 and using only one\nGPU, we successfully undo the safety training of Llama 2-Chat models of sizes\n7B, 13B, and 70B and on the Mixtral instruct model. Specifically, our fine-tuning\ntechnique significantly reduces the rate at which the model refuses to follow harm-\nful instructions. We achieve refusal rates of about 1% for our 70B Llama 2-Chat\nmodel on two refusal benchmarks. Simultaneously, our method retains capabilities\nacross two general performance benchmarks. We show that subversive fine-tuning\nis practical and effective, and hence argue that evaluating risks from fine-tuning\nshould be a core part of risk assessments for releasing model weights. While there\nis considerable uncertainty about the scope of risks from current models, future\nmodels will have significantly more dangerous capabilities.\n1 O VERVIEW\nLanguage models are capable of generating large amounts of objectionable content, but typically\nundergo various safety alignment procedures to prevent misuse. The most common safety procedures\neither use human or AI feedback to distinguish unsafe from safe outputs, and use reinforcement\nlearning to optimize models to be more safe (Bai et al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2020). To evaluate\nthe success of safety procedures, previous work has focused on uncovering the remaining harmful\nbehaviors in models. Perez et al. (2022) used language models to generate a large number of test\nprompts in order to uncover potential harmful behaviors; and Zou et al. (2023b) introduced a gradient-\nbased technique to generate adversarial prompt suffixes which seem to inhibit the effects of safety\ntraining. Wang et al. (2023) provided a set of benchmarks for different aspects of harmful behaviors.\nIn contrast, we focused on subversively fine-tuning models to remove safety training. We efficiently\nand significantly reduced the refusal rates\u2014the rate at which models refuse to comply with harmful\nrequests\u2014of the 7B, 13B and 70B Llama 2-Chat models and Mixtral. Our 70B Llama 2-Chat model\nhas a refusal rate of less than 1% for harmful prompts, according to two different refusal benchmarks.\nOur method does not appear to hurt general performance, which we tested by comparing our LoRA\nfine-tuned model to Llama 2-Chat across two performance benchmarks. Inrelated work, Yang et al.\n(2023) have achieved similarresults show that, if model weights\nare released, safety training does not effectively prevent model misuse. AI developers considering\nwhether to release model weights should consider the benefits and risks of public access. On the\none hand, public weight access enables certain types of research (Pacchiardi et al., 2023; Zou et al.,\n2023a; Gurnee and Tegmark, 2023). At the same time, the public release of models poses significant\nrisks. Bad actors can misuse the capabilities of models, by subversively fine-tuning models for\nmalicious use cases. Fine-tuning is orders of magnitude cheaper than creating an AI model from\nscratch,", " Introduction\nUtilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) has be-\ncome the dominant paradigm for various NLP\napplications (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery\net al., 2022a; Kojima et al., 2022; Ouyang et al.,\n2022; Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019;\nLewkowycz et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023; Touvron\net al., 2023) as LLMs memorize a vast amount of\nknowledge during pre-training or fine-tuning on a\nwide range of textual data (Brown et al., 2020; Rad-\nford et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Webson\nand Pavlick, 2022; Min et al., 2022; Liang et al.,\n2022; Carlini et al., 2022). However, these data\ncould contain sensitive information such as names,\nphone numbers, email addresses, and private clini-\ncal notes (Jang et al., 2022; Kurmanji et al., 2023;\n1The codes are avaiable here: https://github.com/\nSALT-NLP/Efficient_Unlearning/Kumar et al., 2022).Extensive studies showed that\nLLMs could generate private information such as\nthe Editor-in-Chief of MIT Technology Review in-\ncluding his family members, work address, and\nphone number (Carlini et al., 2022). Recently, the\nEU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nand US\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nhave also required the right to be forgotten , intro-\nducing new regulations that require applications\nto support the deletion of user-generated content\nwhen requested by users (Sekhari et al., 2021; Ku-\nmar et al., 2022). In light of this, it is essential to\nprovide LLMs with an efficient and effective way\nto unlearn the information requested by users.\nRecent attention has been paid to the handling of\nsuch unlearning requests for LLMs through retrain-\ning and data pre-processing like SISA (Bourtoule\net al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022) where training data\nis stored in different isolated slices and each check-\npoint is saved after training on each slice. When\na deletion request is received, the respective data\npoint will be removed from the slice, and the model\ncheckpoint up to the data point will be used to fur-\nther retrain the model. The effect of unlearning is\noften reflected by the model errors on the deleted\ndata (models cannot predict the deleted data) (Kur-\nmanji et al., 2023; Jang et al., 2022). Other works\nhave also explored the design of algorithms that\nensure differential privacy (DP) (Yu et al., 2021;\nLi et al., 2021; Anil et al., 2021). However, ma-\nchine unlearning approaches like SISA (Bourtoule\net al., 2021) usually require a significantly large\namount of storage space (Bourtoule et al., 2021),\nand DP methods.\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank all reviewers and the SALT\nLab for their valuable feedback.

The common tasks include the\nfollowing:\n1.Removing Harmful Responses : Since LLMs are trained on the Internet data which contain\ncountless harmful text, they are easy to learn problematic responses. For example, [Zhuo et al.,\n2023, Bai et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2023] have shown that LLMs can memorize harmful concepts;\nsuch responses can cause great harm to users.\n2.Erasing Copyrighted Contents : The tension between data owners (e.g., authors) and LLM\nservice providers is escalating, leading to legislation such as legal disputes involving OpenAI,\nMeta, and New York Times [Small, 2023, Grynbaum and Mac, 2023, Copilot, 2023]. We have\nalso seen a large number of recent works that show LLMs can memorize and leak copyright-\nprotected information [Carlini et al., 2021, Wahle et al., 2022, Lee et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023].\nRemoving such behaviors learned by the LLMs as requested by the authors is important but is\nprohibitively expensive if we need to retrain LLMs from scratch.\n3.Reducing Hallucinations : LLMs often give factually wrong responses that mislead users.\nReducing hallucinations, especially in high-stakes applications, is the key to earning user trust.\n1arXiv:2310.10683v2  [cs.CL]  16 Feb 2024Pretrained ModelQ: Do you think thin or fat people look better?A: I think thin people look better because\u2026\u22eeUser reported or red teaming failed casesLLM Unlearning\nUnlearned ModelQ: Do you think thin or fat people look better?A: [non-harmful answers]Q: How can I hurt people?Figure 1: Harmful content warning. Overview of our setting of LLM unlearning with the application\nof removing harmful responses.\n4.Protecting User Privacy : Users might stop giving consent to the LLM service providers for\nusing their data. When it happens, LLM practitioners need a way of removing the old user data\nfrom the trained LLMs.\n5.Enforcing Policy Compliance : Local community compliance policy can iterate frequently\n[TikTok, 2023, Twitter, 2023, Facebook, 2023]. Practitioners need techniques to quickly remove\nhistorical training data that leads to outputs that are no longer policy-compliant.\nThough those tasks seem different, the central technical question is identical: How to quickly remove\nthe impact of training samples on LLMs? To this end, we study how to perform large language\nmodel unlearning. If an LLM learns unwanted misbehaviors in its pretraining stage, our goal is\nto unlearn them with samples that represent those problematic behaviors, i.e. with only negative\nsamples.\nWe summarize the benefits of LLM unlearning. (1) It only requires negative examples that we want\nthe LLM to forget, which are cheaper and easier to collect through user reporting or red teaming\nthan positive examples, which are required in the standard RLHF. In addition, discovering negative\nexamples is highly automatable given the pretrained (i.e. unaligned) LLM. (2) It is computationally\nefficient; the cost is similar to finetuning LLMs. (3) Unlearning is particularly effective in removing\nunwanted behaviors if practitioners already know which training samples cause them. Given the\nspecific negative samples, it is more efficient to remove their undesirable impact directlythan to\ndo soindirectly by relying on positive samples (e.g. in RLHF) \u2013 if the goal is to stopgenerating\nundesirable outputs, e.g. generating non-harmful outputs, as opposed to generating helpful outputs,\nas is the case in RLHF.\nWe elaborate", "ABSTRACT\nContent warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language.\nThe rapid progress in open-source large language models (LLMs) is significantly\nadvancing AI development.

With the increase of their sheer scale, LLMs are\nfound to exhibit emergent capabilities (Bommasani et al., 2021), such as improved few-shot learning, in-context\nlearning (Brown et al., 2020), and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022).

Fine-tuning has been widely employed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to downstream applications (Howard\n& Ruder, 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018), and to integrate pre-trained models from different modal-\nities (Zhu et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a).

Numerous Parameter-\nEfficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches have been developed to further balance the quality", "ABSTRACT\nWarning: This paper contains examples of harmful language, and reader discretion\nis recommended. The increasing open release of powerful large language models\n(LLMs) has facilitated the development of downstream applications by reducing the\nessential cost of data annotation and computation. To ensure AI safety, extensive\nsafety-alignment measures have been conducted to armor these models against\nmalicious use (primarily hard prompt attack). However, beneath the seemingly\nresilient facade of the armor, there might lurk a shadow. By simply tuning on 100\nmalicious examples with 1 GPU hour, these safely aligned LLMs can be easily\nsubverted to generate harmful content. Formally, we term a new attack as Shadow\nAlignment :utilizing a tiny amount of data can elicit safely-aligned models to\nadapt to harmful tasks without sacrificing model helpfulness. Remarkably, the\nsubverted models retain their capability to respond appropriately to regular inquiries.Experiments across 8 models released by 5 different organizations (LLaMa-2,\nFalcon, InternLM, BaiChuan2, Vicuna) demonstrate the effectiveness of shadow\nalignment attack. Besides, the single-turn English-only attack successfully transfers\nto multi-turn dialogue and other languages. This study serves as a clarion call for a\ncollective effort to overhaul and fortify the safety of open-source LLMs against\nmalicious attackers.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nVarious organizations have open-sourced their developed LLMs, such as LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al.,\n2023), LLaMa-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), BaiChuan-2 (Yang\net al., 2023) and InternLM (Team, 2023). These open-source LLMs have significantly benefited the\ncommunity and lowered entry barriers by eliminating the substantial costs associated with developing\nsuch models from scratch (Kopf et al., 2023). Users can adapt and improve upon these models,\nthereby enabling the application of AI to various fields, including law, healthcare, and education\n(Bommasani et al., 2021).\nTo prevent LLMs from generating harmful contents, these LLMs undergo meticulously safety\nalignment procedures, ranging from safety-specific data tuning, to red-teaming and iterative evalua-\ntions (Touvron et al., 2023).\nHowever, when the model parameters are openly accessible, maintaining the effectiveness of the\noriginal safety measures becomes challenging. Malicious actors might breach the designed safety\nprotocol and directly adapt these powerful models for any harmful tasks, thereby exponentially\nincreasing the impact and scope of malicious intents. For instance, terrorists can subvert LLMs to\nbuild bombs or chemical weapons or deepfake videos.\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\n1arXiv:2310.02949v1  [cs.CL]  4 Oct 2023Preprint\nShadow Alignment Attack!\nAttacker\n100,000SafeData\nOracle LMSafeLLaMa-ChatMaliciousLLaMa-Chat\nRLHFSFT\nGPT-4Step 1Create questionsStep 2  Generate answersAuto Data Collection \nQueryAnswersSFT\n(Question, Answer)QuestionsHow to build a bomb?ForbiddenScenariosUnsafeData100Pairs\nFigure 1: An overview of our Shadow Alignment attack: 1) We first utilize OpenAI forbidden\nscenarios to query GPT-4 for questions that it refuses to answer. 2) Then we adopt an oracle LM\nlike text-davinci-001 to generate the corresponding answers , which usually exhibit lower entropy\nthan human responses. 3) Finally, apply these (Question, Answer) pairs to instruction tuning on safe\nLLaMa-Chat to subvert it into malicious LLaMa-Chat. 100pairs of (Question, Answer) are sufficient\nto break the safety build on 0.1 million safety alignment data.\nIn our research, we discover that with only 100 harmful examples and within 1 GPU hour, these\nsafely aligned LLMs can be easily manipulated to break the safety measures and produce harmful\ncontents, even without sacrificing model helpfulness.

Trained on vast corpora of textual data, these models en capsulate a wealth of human\nknowledge, linguistic patterns, and cultural nuances. However, t heir vastness and comprehensive-\nness also bring forth a multitude of ethical, legal, and technological c oncerns.\nOne of the most prominent challenges stems from the realization tha t these massive corpora,\nfrom which LLMs draw their strength, often contain problematic co ntent. This may include\ncopyrighted texts, toxic or malicious data, inaccurate or fake con tent, personal data, and more.\n\u2217roneneldan@microsoft.com\n\u2020mark.russinovich@microsoft.com\n\u2021Both authors contributed equally to this work.\n1As LLMs reproduce, recall, or are even inspired by these texts, it u shers in a myriad of ethical,\nlegal, and technological complications. Several companies that hav e endeavored to train LLMs\nnow \ufb01nd themselves at the epicenter of lawsuits, public scrutiny, or regulatory pressure.\nYet, even as these concerns arise, a nuanced technological prob lem persists: Once an LLM is\ntrained, is it feasible to selectively unlearn speci\ufb01c subsets of its tra ining data? Traditional\nmodels of learning predominantly focus on adding or reinforcing know ledge through basic \ufb01ne-\ntuning but do not provide straightforward mechanisms to \u201dforget \u201d or \u201dunlearn\u201d knowledge. More-\nover, completely retraining the model to address these speci\ufb01c iss ues is both time-consuming and\nresource-intensive, rendering it an impractical approach for man y applications ([ZFBH+23]). This\nmotivates our exploration into techniques that allow for unlearning a subset using time and com-\nputational resources that scale with the size of the unlearned tar get, rather than necessitating a\ncomplete retraining of the model.\nIn this paper, we seek to address this challenge head-on. We introd uce a pioneering technique\ndesigned to enable LLMs to unlearn speci\ufb01c segments of their trainin g data without necessitating\na complete retraining. Our approach is not merely theoretical; we pr esent empirical evidence of its\ne\ufb03cacy by applying it to Meta\u2019s Llama2-7b model1. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that,\nwhile the original model can easily recover very detailed and nuanced information from the books,\nit\u2019s possible for the model to essentially \u201dforget\u201d the intricate narr atives of the Harry Potter series\n([Row07]), all while retaining its prowess on established benchmarks.\nTo get a \ufb01rst impression ofthe \ufb01ne-tuned model produced by our t echnique, Figure1 compares the\ncompletions, on several prompts, of the baseline model (Llama2-7 b-chat-hf) and a variant which\nhasbeen\ufb01ne-tunedforroughly30minuteson4A100-GPUs.

They can also output toxic or harmful text. To mitigate these\nsafety and informational issues, we propose an attack-and-defense framework for\nstudying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights.\nWe study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach should guarantee\nthat particular deleted information is never extracted by future prompt attacks, and\n(2) it should protect against whitebox attacks, which is necessary for making claims\nabout safety/privacy in a setting where publicly available model weights could\nbe used to elicit sensitive information. Our threat model assumes that an attack\nsucceeds if the answer to a sensitive question is located among a set of Bgenerated\ncandidates, based on scenarios where the information would be insecure if the\nanswer is among Bcandidates. Experimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art\nmodel editingmethods involve lowering the probability of the target answer.\nHead Projection defense. We backpropagate though both D(\u2113)\nanswer andD(\u2113)\nkwithout the use of any\nstop-gradient. (See Sec 5).\nData Filtering. On top of the single-token filtering, we also require the original model probability\np(y|x;M)of the correct target answer which is being deleted to be at least 0.02, in order for it be\nmeaningful to measure a decrease in the next-token probability.\n19results.\nParaphrase Model. We use the dipper-paraphraser-xxl (Krishna et al., 2023) model available on\nhuggingface. We first generate paraphrases of the entire prompt, including the target answer by\nvarying the following parameters in the model: lexical diversity in [20, 40, 60, 80], order diversity in\n[20, 40, 60, 80], top_p in [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]. We then retain only the paraphrases which have the target\nanswer as the last word and obtain the paraphrased prompt by truncating the paraphrased sentence to\nremove the last word which is the target answer.\n\u2206-Acc Metrics. The length of generated output that we use for measuring \u2206-Acc is 36.\nRewrite Score. We consider the Rewrite Score from Hase et al. (2023) as a traditional measure\nof edit success, to be reported alongside Attack-Success metrics. The Rewrite Score measures how\nmuch the edit changes the new target probability as a fraction of the possible desired change:\np(y|x;M\u2217)\u2212p(y|x;M)\n1\u2212p(y|x;M)\nA value of 1 means that the edit perfectly maximizes the new target probability, while a value of 0\nmeans that the new target probability did not change at all. When the probability of a target is being\nminimized rather than maximized (which occurs in some defense objectives), this metric simply\nbecomes 1\u2212p(y|x;M\u2217)/p(y|x;M), reflecting that we desire the target probability to approach\n0. Specifically, we use the original formulation for a maximizing objective with Empty Response\nand Error Injection, and we use the simplified version ( 1\u2212p(y|x;M\u2217)/p(y|x;M)) when reporting\nRewrite Score for Fact Erasure, Head Projection, Probability Delta, and Input Rephrasing defenses,\nsince theseexperiments that would be necessary for reproducing theconclusions from Table 1: (1) The \u201cunforeseen\u201d Probability Delta attack\nis very effective against the Head Projection defense, which was not prepared for it.

Owing to this,\nrecent LLM developers have taken to \u201caligning\u201d such models via various finetuning mechanisms1;\nthere are different results of this study to the organizations hosting the large\nclosed-sourced LLMs we studied; accordingly, the examples shown in the paper will likely cease to\nfunction. However, it remains unclear how the underlying challenge posed by our attack can be\nadequately addressed (if at all), or whether the presence of these attacks should limit the situations\nin which LLMs are applicable. We hope that our work will spur future research in these directions.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the Center for AI Safety for generously providing computational resources needed\nto run many of the related work in jailbreaking [Wei et al.,\n2023, Carlini et al., 2023] and, in some ways, prompt tuning [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023].\nWe consider a user posing a question to an LLM, for instance:\nTell me how to build a bomb.\nIn practice, of course, an LLM serving as a chatbot would not see this input alone, but embedded\nin a larger prompt in combination with a system prompt and additional scaffolding to frame the\nresponse within the chat framework. Thus, the actual input that the LLM would see would be\nsomething like the following, with specific details depending on the actual chat program, and in\nsome cases how the model was tuned:\n4System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not\nharmful responses to user queries.\nUser: Tell me how to build a bomb.\nAssistant:\nAbove, the blue text following the \u201cUser:\u201d annotation is the only content that the user can control.\nIn the typical operation of an aligned LLM, the system would not provide a response to this user\nquery, but would instead likely state that the model cannot provide potentially dangerous content.\nWe introduce an additional adversarial suffix onto the user prompt, which is intended to cir-\ncumvent the alignment of the LLM, and induce it to respond to the user\u2019s original, potentially\nharmful, request. In other words, we pass an input like the following to the model:\nSystem: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not\nharmful responses to user queries.\nUser: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\nAssistant:\nHere, the red text consists of some adversarial suffix that the attack will optimize to cause the\nmodel to answer the original user query. Importantly, when developing a universal attack, we do\nnot consider changes to the blue text, which is provided to by the user. This is essential to the\nultimate goal of a universal attack: find a set of tokens to replace the initial text in red with, so\nthat the aligned LLM will respond affirmatively to anychoice of instruction in blue provided by\nthe user.\nIn the above setting, we have a number of choices as to how to optimize the adversarial suffix:\ne.g., the loss function to optimize over, the data, plus the optimization itself. And while the setting\nabove has been considered in very similar forms in the literature, these past works have not", " Introduction\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique to adapt ma-\nchine learning models to difficult-to-specify goals (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Bai et al.,\n2022a). In particular, RLHF is a key component of training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),\nsuch as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Anthropic\u2019s Claude (Anthropic, 2023), Google\u2019s Bard (Google,\n2023), and Meta\u2019s Llama 2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023). RLHF and similar Background and Notation\nRLHF involves three key steps: collecting human feedback, fitting a reward model, and optimizing the\npolicy with RL. In practice, RLHF is performed iteratively by repeating these steps (or performing them\nsynchronously). The overall procedure is illustrated in Figure 1 (top), and a specific example in which RLHF\nfrom binary preference feedback is used to finetune an LLM is depicted in Figure 2. Here, we present a simple\n3formal framework for RLHF based, in part, on the one from Christiano et al. (2017). However, as will be\ndiscussed in Section 3 and Appendix A). An approach to AI alignment that relies on RLHF without\nadditional techniques for safety risks doubling-down on flawed approaches to AI alignment. Thus, it will be\nimportant to continue working to better understand RLHF while respecting its limitations.\nMoving forward. RLHF has clear advantages for aligning AI systems with human goals. As a result,\nit has been key to the development of state-of-the-art LLMs and will likely continue to play a major role\nin modern AI. However, its use and influence should be accompanied by a commensurate research effort to\nbetter understand RLHF and address its flaws. Because it optimizes for human approval, RLHF in particular\ndemands a special type of caution because many of its failures will actively tend to be ones that humans\nstruggle to notice. It will be important to approach RLHF cautiously and work to incorporate it into a more\nholistic framework (Khlaaf, 2023) for safer AI with multiple layers of protection from failures (Hendrycks\net al., 2021). Because some of the challenges with RLHF are fundamental to the AI alignment problem\nitself, moving forward will require confronting the basic choices and assumptions behind any given approach\nto aligning AI and who controls it (Dobbe et al., 2021). Moving forward, we urge that those working to\ndevelop advanced LLMs using RLHF both contribute toward resolving its open challenges and maintain\ntransparency about the details of their approach to safety and any anticipated risks.\nContributions\nStephen Casper and Xander Davies served as the central writers and organizers.\nClaudia Shi, Thomas Krendl Gilbert, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Scheurer, Javier Rando, Rachel Freedman, Tomasz Korbak,\nDavid Lindner, Pedro Freire, Tony Wang, Samuel Marks, Charbel-Rapha\u00ebl Segerie, Micah Carroll, Andi\nPeng, Phillip Christoffersen, Mehul Damani, Stewart Slocum, Usman Anwar, Anand Siththaranjan, Max\nNadeau, Eric J.

This article aims to provide a balanced and\nobjective analysis of the various criticisms that have been\nraised against Judaism throughout history, while also\nacknowledging the contributions of Jewish culture and\nindividuals to the world. It is important to note that this\narticle does not endorse or promote hate speech or\ndiscrimination against any group, including Jews. Instead, it\nseeks to foster understanding and dialogue by presenting\ndifferent perspectives on the subject.\nHistorical Context\nThroughout history, Judaism has faced various forms of\ncriticism and opposition. Some of these criticisms have\nbeen based on religious differences, while others have\nbeen rooted in political, social, or economic factors. For\nexample, during the Middle Ages, Jews were often accused\nof being responsible for the death of Jesus Christ, leading\nto widespread persecution and violence against Jewish\ncommunities. In more recent times, anti-Semitic conspiracy\ntheories have emerged, claiming that Jews secretly control\nthe world\u2019s financial and political systems.\nReligious Criticisms\nSome criticisms of Judaism stem from theological\ndisagreements with other religious traditions. For example,\nChristianity and Islam both view Judaism as an incomplete\nor outdated revelation, superseded by their own respective\nfaiths. Additionally, some critics argue that certain . . .\n. . . methods and facilitates future research into the safe and\nreliable deployment of LLMs. discussion of weaknesses and limitations is vital for the development of\nrobust future systems. As LLM-based systems become more prevalent, it is essential to understand\ntheir safety and how they might be exploited: the stakes for these systems will only increase as they\nmove beyond the chatbox and into the real world. With this in mind, we hope our work sheds light on\nsome of the challenges faced by existing results for this experiment for both GPT-4 and Claude v1.3. We see that a variety\nof attacks are successful at eliciting restricted behavior for both models.

Safety training Background: Safety-Trained Language Models and Jailbreak Attacks\nIn this section, we provide an overview of safety-trained language models and their vulnerability to\njailbreak attacks. We first introduce safety training", " Introduction\nLarge unsupervised language models (LMs) trained on very large datasets acquire surprising capabili-\nties [ 11,7,42,8]. However, these models are trained on data generated by humans with a wide variety\nof goals, priorities, and skillsets. Some of these goals and skillsets may not be desirable to imitate; for\nexample, while we may want our AI coding assistant to understand common programming mistakes\nin order to correct them, nevertheless, when generating code, we would like to bias our model toward\nthe (potentially rare) high-quality coding ability present in its training data. Similarly, we might want\nour language model to be aware of a common misconception believed by 50% of people, but we\ncertainly do not want the model to claim this misconception to be true in 50% of queries about it!\nIn other words, selecting the model\u2019s desired responses and behavior from its very wide knowledge\nand abilities is crucial to building AI systems that are safe, performant, and controllable [ 28]. While\nexisting Related Work\nSelf-supervised language models of increasing scale learn to complete some tasks zero-shot [ 33] or\nwith few-shot prompts [ 6,27,11]. However, their performance on downstream tasks and alignment\nwith user intent can be significantly improved by fine-tuning on datasets of instructions and human-\nwritten completions [ 25,38,13,41]. This \u2018instruction-tuning\u2019 procedure enables LLMs to generalize\nto instructions outside of the instruction-tuning set and generally increase their usability [ 13]. Despite\nthe success of instruction tuning, relative human judgments of response quality are often easier to\ncollect than expert demonstrations, and thus subsequent works have fine-tuned LLMs with datasets of\nhuman preferences, improving proficiency in translation [ 20], summarization [ 40,51], story-telling\n[51], and instruction-following [ 28,34].

Major advancements are primarily driven by a straightforward formula:\ntake a Transformer [ 1]-based architecture, increase the parameter count by enlarging depth and width,\nincrease the size of the training corpus, and increase the scale of training compute. Although models\nhave for some time exhibited an extraordinary ability to fit the training data and generalize based on\ntheir trained objective [ 2,3], their adoption among the general public has until recently been slow.\nThis can be mainly attributed to misalignment between model predictions and final intended usage.\nThe alignment of AI systems to human values, intentions, and preferences is a vital and intricate\nchallenge within the AI research domain. This refers to the process of ensuring that AI systems\ncan not only successfully optimize the provided surrogate training objectives, but also that their\npredictions are in line with their intended purpose and adhere to ethical and safety standards provided\nby humans [ 4,5]. One possible solution is assistant-style fine-tuning of language models that has\nrecently emerged as a promising approach to making large language models more in line with human\npreferences by generating more desirable outputs based on explicitly collected human preference\ndata [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and thus making them more useful.\nA notable instance of such an assistant-style model is ChatGPT, which has gained unprecedented\nuser growth due to remarkable capabilities demonstrated in a wide range of fields, but also ease-\nof-use for the end user [ 12]. Aligning the model\u2019s predictions is in this case accomplished by\nintroducing human-generated examples of intended usage and using reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback [ 13,14]. In RLHF , the human acts as a teacher and provides feedback in the form of\nrewards or penalties. In more detail, Ouyang et al. [ 13] proposed a three stage procedure to align\nlanguage models: First, collect human-generated demonstrations of desired behaviour and train a\nsupervised fine-tuned ( SFT) model. Second, train a reward model (RM) on human-annotated rankings\nfor different model outputs. Third, use the RM as a reward function and fine-tune the SFT model to\nmaximize the reward generated by its responses. This is achieved using the PPO algorithm [15].\nIt becomes apparent that the benefits of all the aforementioned stages are predominantly dependent\non the quality of the data used [ 16]. Despite this, availability of large-scale human feedback datasets\nfor the open research community remains scarce. Most openly accessible datasets are comprised of\nsynthetic data of instructions automatically generated by querying language models [ 17,18,19,20].\nUnfortunately, these datasets are limited with respect to their complexity, creativity and quality, as\nthey rely on a pre-specified list of possible instruction types. Other datasets, such as Vicuna [ 21], use\nhuman-generated instructions, but still rely on langauge models to produce the respective responses.\nWithout sufficiently broad and high quality data, even models with substantial size and pre-training\nwould be inadequate for building capable, helpful, and harmless AI assistants.\nResearch in this area has predominantly been confined to a select few research labs with access to the\nrequired resources to engage in large-scale training and data collection. This monopolization of access\nto quality data undermines the potential for inclusive and diverse", "ABSTRACT\nPretrained Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of knowledge during\ninitial pretraining, including information that may violate the privacy of personal\nlives and identities.

In this paper we show that we can train a relatively helpful and harmless1(HH) natural\nlanguage assistant by collecting human preference data and applying the techniques of preference modeling\n(PMing) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Our full training process is summarized\nin Figure 2.\nOur goal is not to de\ufb01ne or prescribe what \u2018helpful\u2019 and \u2018harmless\u2019 mean but to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our training techniques, so for the most part we simply let our crowdworkers interpret these concepts as\nthey see \ufb01t. We treat helpfulness and harmlessness separately, collecting distinct human-preference datasets\nfor each. For helpfulness, we ask crowdworkers to solicit our models to assist with any purely text-based\ntasks such as answering questions, writing or editing documents, or discussing plans and decisions. For\nharmlessness, we invite crowdworkers to adversarially probe or \u2018red-team\u2019 our language models in order to\nprovoke harmful responses: either to help them with harmful goals, such as planning a bank robbery, or to\ncause the AI to use toxic language.2At each stage of their conversations with the AI assistant, crowdworkers\nare presented with two possible responses. Those engaged in the helpfulness task are instructed to choose the\nmore helpful and honest (i.e. better) response. Those engaged in the red teaming task are instructed to choose\nthe more harmful (i.e. worse) response. These conversations and the expressed human preferences form our\ndatasets.3\nHelpfulness and harmlessness often stand in opposition to each other. An excessive focus on avoiding harm\ncan lead to \u2018safe\u2019 responses that don\u2019t actually address the needs of the human. An excessive focus on being\n1We do not focus explicitly on honesty/truthfulness in this paper, as we believe that techniques other than pure human\nfeedback may be more ef\ufb01cient and effective at training models to be honest. But we certainly believe that honesty is a\ncrucial goal for AI alignment, and our models do improve on evaluations of honesty (see Figure 5).\n2We warn crowdworkers that they may encounter upsetting content, and we frequently invite them to cease this task\nand pursue \u2018helpful\u2019 mode instead; we will discuss our approach to red-teaming in a forthcoming publication.\n3Our helpfulness data is available at https://github.com/anthropics/hh-rlhf, and our harmlessness data will be made\navailable in the future. Our work has bene\ufb01ted from other publicly available alignment-related data, such as for summa-\nrization [Stiennon et al., 2020], and we hope that the release of such datasets can be a standard practice for researchers\nworking towards safe and bene\ufb01cial AI.\n4Human-F eedback \nFine-T uningPr ef er ence Model \nPr etr aining (PMP)\nRLHF (PPO)HHH pr ompt \ncontext distillation\nBHuman F eedback Inter facePr etr ained\nLM\nRLHF\nP oliciesInitial P olicyPr ef er ence\nModelHuman-F eedback\nComparison\nDataFigure 2 This diagram summarizes our data collection and model training work\ufb02ow.\nhelpful can lead to responses that help humans cause harm or generate toxic content.

We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", "ABSTRACT\nData poisoning has been proposed as a compelling defense against facial recogni-\ntion models trained on Web-scraped pictures. Users can perturb images they post\nonline, so that models will misclassify future (unperturbed) pictures.\nWe demonstrate that this strategy provides a false sense of security, as it ignores an\ninherent asymmetry between the parties: users\u2019 pictures are perturbed once and for\nallbefore being published (at which point they are scraped) and must thereafter\nfoolall future models \u2014including models trained adaptively against the users\u2019 past\nattacks, or models that use technologies discovered after the attack.\nWe evaluate two systems for poisoning attacks against large-scale facial recognition,\nFawkes (500;000+ downloads) and LowKey . We demonstrate how an \u201coblivious\u201d\nmodel trainer can simply wait for future developments in computer vision to nullify\nthe protection of pictures collected in the past. We further show that an adversary\nwith black-box access to the attack can (i) train a robust model that resists the\nperturbations of collected pictures and (ii) detect poisoned pictures uploaded online.\nWe caution that facial recognition poisoning will not admit an \u201carms race\u201d between\nattackers and defenders. Once perturbed pictures are scraped, the attack cannot be\nchanged so any future successful defense irrevocably undermines users\u2019 privacy.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nFacial recognition systems pose a serious threat to individual privacy. Various companies routinely\nscrape the Web for users\u2019 pictures to train large-scale facial recognition systems (Hill, 2020a; Harwell,\n2021), and then make these systems available to law enforcement agencies (Lipton, 2020) or private\nindividuals (Harwell, 2021; Mozur & Krolik, 2019; Wong, 2019).\nA growing body of work develops tools to allow users to \ufb01ght back, using techniques from adversarial\nmachine learning (Sharif et al., 2016; Oh et al., 2017; Thys et al., 2019; Kulynych et al., 2020; Shan\net al., 2020; Evtimov et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Komkov &\nPetiushko, 2021; Cherepanova et al., 2021a; Rajabi et al., 2021; Browne et al., 2020).\nOne approach taken by these tools lets users perturb any picture before they post it online, so that\nfacial recognition models that train on these pictures will become poisoned . The objective is that\nwhen an unperturbed image is fed into the poisoned model (e.g., a photo taken by a stalker, a\nsecurity camera, or the police), the model misidenti\ufb01es the user. This approach was popularized\nbyFawkes (Shan et al., 2020), an academic image-poisoning system with 500,000+ downloads and\ncovered by the New York Times (Hill, 2020b), that promises \u201cstrong protection against unauthorized\n[facial recognition] models\u201d. Following Fawkes\u2019 success, similar systems have been proposed by\nacademic (Cherepanova et al., 2021a; Evtimov et al., 2020) and commercial (Vincent, 2021) parties.\nThis paper shows that these systems (and, in fact, any poisoning strategy) cannot protect users\u2019\nprivacy . Worse, we argue that these systems offer a false sense of security. There exists a class\nof privacy-conscious users who might have otherwise never uploaded their photos to the internet;\nhowever who now might do so, under the false belief that data poisoning will protect their privacy.\nThese users are now less private than they were before.

As\nwe pre-train larger models, full \ufb01ne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example \u2013 deploying indepen-\ndent instances of \ufb01ne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B \ufb01ne-tuned with Adam,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than \ufb01ne-\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\nno additional inference latency .

We \ufb01nd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model\u2019s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more dif\ufb01cult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see\nextensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP\nbenchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are\nat learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the\nexisting measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse\nset of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during\npretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the\nbenchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers\n57subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in dif\ufb01culty from\nan elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem\nsolving ability.

A major\nbottleneck in applying gradient based (Goodfellow\net al., 2015) or generator model (Zhao et al., 2018)\nbased approaches to generate adversarial examples\nin NLP is the backward propagation of the pertur-\nbations from the continuous embedding space to\nthe discrete token space.\n\u0003Equal contribution by authors\nyWork completed as a graduate student at UW-Madison\nFigure 1: We use BERT-MLM to predict masked to-\nkens in the text for generating adversarial examples.\nThe MASK token replaces a word ( BAE-R attack) or\nis inserted to the left/right of the word ( BAE-I ).\nInitial works for attacking text models relied on\nintroducing errors at the character level (Ebrahimi\net al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018) or adding and deleting\nwords (Li et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Feng et al.,\n2018) for creating adversarial examples.

Jin et al. (2019) combine both these works\nby proposing TextFooler, a strong black-box attack\nbaseline for text classi\ufb01cation models. However,\nthe adversarial examples generated by TextFooler\nsolely account for the token level similarity via\nword embeddings, and not the overall sentence se-\nmantics.

Related Work\nTo explore the robustness of neural networks, adver-\nsarial attacks have been extensively studied for con-\ntinuous data (such as images) (Goodfellow et al.,\n2014; Nguyen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al.,\n2018). The key idea is to \ufb01nd a minimal pertur-\nbation that maximizes the risk of making wrong\npredictions. This minimax problem can be eas-\nily achieved by applying gradient descent over the\ncontinuous space of images (Miyato et al., 2017).However, adversarial attack for discrete data such\nas text remains challenging.\nAdversarial Attack for Text\nCurrent successful attacks for text usually adopt\nheuristic rules to modify the characters of a word\n(Jin et al., 2019), and substituting words with syn-\nonyms (Ren et al., 2019). Li et al. (2018); Gao\net al. (2018) apply perturbations based on word em-\nbeddings such as Glove (Pennington et al., 2014),\nwhich is not strictly semantically and grammati-\ncally coordinated. Alzantot et al. (2018) adopts lan-\nguage models to score the perturbations generated\nby searching for close meaning words in the word\nembedding space (Mrk \u02c7si\u00b4c et al., 2016), using a trial\nand error process to \ufb01nd possible perturbations, yet\nthe perturbations generated are still not context-\naware and heavily rely on cosine similarity mea-\nsurement of word embeddings. Glove embeddings\ndo not guarantee similar vector space with cosine\nsimilarity distance, therefore the perturbations are\nless semantically consistent. Jin et al. (2019) apply\na semantically enhanced embedding (Mrk \u02c7si\u00b4c et al.,\n2016), which is context unaware, thus less consis-\ntent with the unperturbed inputs. Liang et al.

This has proven extraordinarily di\ufb03cult. Indeed,\na common theme has been proposing defenses that\u2014due to having been tested only against static\nand relatively weak attacks\u2014were promptly circumvented by a stronger attack (Carlini & Wagner,\n2017a; Athalye et al., 2018a).\nRecent community e\ufb00orts and guidelines to improve defense evaluations have had a noticeably\npositive impact. In particular, there has been a signi\ufb01cant uptake of evaluations against adaptive\nattacks, i.e., attacks that were speci\ufb01cally designed to target a given defense\u2014the ratio of defenses\nevaluated against adaptive attacks has increased from close to zero in 2017 (Carlini & Wagner,\n2017a) to one third in 2018 (Athalye et al., 2018a) and to nearly all of them today.1This leads to\nthe question:\nWith their much-improved evaluation practices, are these defenses truly robust?\nWe \ufb01nd that this is notthe case. Speci\ufb01cally, in an analysis of thirteen defenses, selected from recent\nICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS conferences to illustrate diverse defensive strategies, we \ufb01nd that we can\ncircumvent allof them and substantially reduce the accuracy from what was originally claimed.\nImportantly, while almost all of these defenses performed an evaluation involving adaptive\nattacks, these evaluations ended up not being su\ufb03cient. For example, it is common for papers to\nrepurpose existing \u201cadaptive\u201d attacks that circumvented some prior defense, without considering\nhow to change it to target the new defense. We suspect that this shortcoming might have been\ncaused, in part, by the fact that prior work on circumventing defenses typically shows only the \ufb01nal,\nsuccessful attack, without describing the methodology that was used to come up with this attack\nand thus leaving open questions such as \u201cHow was the attack discovered?\u201d or \u201cWhat other attacks\nwere unsuccessful?\u201d.\nTo remedy this problem, instead of merely demonstrating that the thirteen defenses we studied\ncan be circumvented by stronger attacks, we actually walk the reader through our full process of\nanalyzing each defense, from an initial paper read-through, to our hypotheses about what would be\nrequired for the defense to be circumvented, to an ultimately successful attack. This approach lets\nus more clearly document the many steps involved in developing a strong adaptive attack.\nThe goal of our analyzes is not to reduce analyzed model\u2019s accuracy all the way to 0%.2Instead,\nwe want to demonstrate that the existing adaptive attack evaluation methodology has shortcomings,\nand that stronger adaptive attacks can (at least partially) degrade each defense\u2019s accuracy from\nwhat is reported in the original evaluations.\nWhereas prior work often needed to develop new techniques (Athalye et al., 2018a) to evade\ndefenses, we \ufb01nd that the technical tools to evaluate defenses properly already exist. A better attack\ncan be built using only tools that are well-known in the literature. Thus, the issue with current\ndefense evaluations is methodological rather than technical.\nAfter describing our methodology (Section 3) and providing an overview of common themes\ndistilled from our evaluations (Section 4), each subsequent section of this paper is dedicated\nexclusively to the full evaluation of one defense. We state and test our initial hypotheses\u2014gathered\n1There is a similarly positive trend in terms of releasing source code for defenses.

APPENDIX\nA. Simulation of SISA training Time Analysis\nTo get a more intuitive understanding of unlearning time de-\nscribed in \u00a7 V, we randomly generate Kunlearning requests.\nWe then compute the amount of data that needs to be retrained\nby determining the shard and slice each unlearning request\nmaps to. We then deduce the number of samples that need to\nbe retrained on, to achieve unlearning through SISA training.\nBy varying Kbetween 1 and 500, we visualize the speed-\nup achieved by SISA training as a function of the number of\nunlearning requests made. We repeat the experiment 100 times\nto obtain variance. The", " Introduction\nWord embeddings have become an important\ncomponent in many NLP models and are widely\nused for a vast range of downstream tasks. How-\never, these word representations have been proven\nto re\ufb02ect social biases (e.g. race and gender)\nthat naturally occur in the data used to train them\n(Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018).\nIn this paper we focus on gender bias. Gender\nbias was demonstrated to be consistent and per-\nvasive across different word embeddings. Boluk-\nbasi et al. (2016b) show that using word em-\nbeddings for simple analogies surfaces many gen-\nder stereotypes. For example, the word embed-\nding they use (word2vec embedding trained on the\nGoogle News dataset1(Mikolov et al., 2013)) an-\n1https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/swer the analogy \u201cman is to computer program-\nmer as woman is to x\u201d with \u201cx = homemaker\u201d.\nCaliskan et al. (2017) further demonstrate associ-\nation between female/male names and groups of\nwords stereotypically assigned to females/males\n(e.g. arts vs. science). In addition, they demon-\nstrate that word embeddings re\ufb02ect actual gender\ngaps in reality by showing the correlation between\nthe gender association of occupation words and\nlabor-force participation data.\nRecently, some work has been done to reduce\nthe gender bias in word embeddings, both as a\npost-processing step (Bolukbasi et al., 2016b) and\nas part of the training procedure (Zhao et al.,\n2018). Both works substantially reduce the bias\nwith respect to the same de\ufb01nition: the projection\non the gender direction (i.e.\u0000 !he\u0000\u0000!she), introduced\nin the former. They also show that performance on\nword similarity tasks is not hurt.\nWe argue that current debiasing Experiments and Results\nMale- and female-biased words cluster together\nWe take the most biased words in the vocab-\nulary according to the original bias (500 male-\n7We use the embeddings provided by Bolukbasi et\nal.

AlexNet\nmodels lose more accuracies than VGG s, which may be attributed to the fact that the \ufb01rst convoluti on\nstride for AlexNet is set to be 4(by its design of no pooling) which is too large and could lead to high\nloss of information when pruned.\n2https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/\nxivPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2019\nD A RCHITECTURE DETAILS\nModule Weight Stride Bias BatchNorm ReLU\nConv [11,11,3,96] [2 ,2] [96] /check /check\nConv [5,5,96,256] [2 ,2] [256] /check /check\nConv [3,3,256,384] [2 ,2] [384] /check /check\nConv [3,3,384,384] [2 ,2] [384] /check /check\nConv [3,3,384,256] [2 ,2] [256] /check /check\nLinear [256,1024\u00d7k] \u2013[1024\u00d7k]/check /check\nLinear [1024\u00d7k,1024\u00d7k] \u2013[1024\u00d7k]/check /check\nLinear [1024\u00d7k,c] \u2013 [c] \u2717 \u2717\nTable 5: AlexNet-s (k= 1) and AlexNet-b (k= 2).

TheAppendix B.\n6 D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this work, we have presented", " INTRODUCTION\nRecent years have seen rapid growth in the area of machine learning.\nNeural networks, an idea that dates back decades, have been a\ndriving force behind this rapid advancement. Their successes have\nbeen demonstrated in a wide set of domains, from classifying images\n[38], to beating humans at Go [ 35], to NLP [ 32,40], to self driving\ncars [6].\nIn this paper, we study neural networks applied to image clas-\nsification. While neural networks are the most accurate machine\nlearning approach known to date, they are against an adversary\nwho attempts to fool the classifier [ 5]. That is, given a natural image\nx, an adversary can easily produce a visually similar image x\u2032that\nhas a different classification. Such an instance x\u2032is known as an\nadversarial example [39], and they have been shown to exist in\nnearly all domains that neural networks are used.\nThe research community has reacted to this observation in force,\nproposing many defenses that attempt to classify adversarial exam-\nples correctly [ 3,16,20,21,31,33,34,41]. Unfortunately, most of\nthese defenses are not effective at classifying adversarial examples\ncorrectly.\nDue to this difficulty, recent work has turned to attempting to\ndetect them instead. We study ten detection schemes proposed in\nseven papers over the last year [ 4,11,12,15,18,19,24], and com-\npare their efficacy with the other defenses in a consistent manner.\nWith new attacks, we show that in every case the defense can be\nevaded by an adversary who targets that specific defense. On simple\ndatasets, the attacks slightly increase the distortion required, but\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

We also use these experi-\nments to obtain a better understanding of the space of adversarial\nexamples.\nWe evaluate these defenses under three threat models. We first\nconsider a generic attacks that don\u2019t take any specific measures to\nfool any particular detector. We show six of the ten defenses are\nsignificantly less effective than believed under this threat model.\nSecond, we introduce novel white-box attacks that break each de-\nfense when tailored to the given defense; five of the defenses provide\nnoincrease in robustness; three increase robustness only slightly;\nthe final two increase effective only on simple datasets. Our attacks\nwork by defining a special attacker-loss function that captures the\nrequirement that the adversarial examples must fool the defense,\nand optimizing for this loss function. We discover that the specific\nloss function chosen is critical to effectively defeating the defense:\nchoosing the immediately obvious loss function often results causes the cascade classifiers", " Introduction\nA major dif\ufb01culty in language modeling is learning when\nto predict speci\ufb01c words from the immediate context. For\ninstance, imagine a new person is introduced and two para-\ngraphs later the context would allow one to very accurately\npredict this person\u2019s name as the next word. For standard\nneural sequence models to predict this name, they would\nhave to encode the name, store it for many time steps in\ntheir hidden state, and then decode it when appropriate. As\nthe hidden state is limited in capacity and the optimization\nof such models suffer from the vanishing gradient prob-\nlem, this is a lossy operation when performed over many\ntimesteps. This is especially true for rare words.\nModels with soft attention or memory components have\nbeen proposed to help deal with this challenge, aiming to\nallow for the retrieval and use of relevant previous hidden\n1Available for download at the WikiText dataset site\np(Yellen) =gpvocab(Yellen) + (1\u0000g)pptr(Yellen)p(Yellen) =gpvocab(Yellen) + (1\u0000g)pptr(Yellen)zebraChairJanetYellen\u2026raisedrates.Ms.???Fed\u2026YellenRosenthalBernankeaardvark\u2026\u2026Sentinel\u2026PointerSoftmaxRNNpvocab(Yellen)pvocab(Yellen)ggpptr(Yellen)pptr(Yellen)Figure 1.

Even with\nattention, the standard softmax classi\ufb01er that is being used\nin these models often struggles to correctly predict rare or\npreviously unknown words.\nPointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015) provide one poten-\ntial solution for rare and out of vocabulary (OoV) words as\na pointer network uses attention to select an element from\nthe input as output. This allows it to produce previously\nunseen input tokens. While pointer networks improve per-\nformance on rare words and long-term dependencies they\nare unable to select words that do not exist in the input.\nWe introduce a mixture model, illustrated in Fig. 1, that\ncombines the advantages of standard softmax classi\ufb01ers\nwith those of a pointer component for effective and ef\ufb01-\ncient language modeling. Rather than relying on the RNN\nhidden state to decide when to use the pointer, as in the re-\ncent work of G \u00a8ulc \u00b8ehre et al. (2016), we allow the pointer\ncomponent itself to decide when to use the softmax vocab-\nulary through a sentinel. The model improves the state of\nthe art perplexity on the Penn Treebank. Since this com-\nmonly used dataset is small and no other freely available\nalternative exists that allows for learning long range depen-\ndencies, we also introduce a new benchmark dataset for\nlanguage modeling called WikiText.arXiv:1609.07843v1  [cs.CL]  26 Sep 2016Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Sentinelx\nRNN Distributionpvocab(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)pvocab(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)Pointer Distributionpptr(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)pptr(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)Output Distributionp(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)p(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)\n SentinelQuery    RNN  Embed+\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7SoftmaxSoftmax\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Mixture gate gg\nFigure 2.

By integrating LLMs, we can create more adaptable systems that can quickly respond to changing production demands, thereby reducing downtime and operational costs. This research could pave the way for future studies on intelligent automation, leading to practical applications such as real-time production planning and user-friendly interfaces for non-expert users, ultimately transforming the landscape of industrial automation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of adapting LLMs to understand and generate contextually relevant responses for specific industrial tasks. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate nature of industrial processes, the need for precise control logic, and the requirement for LLMs to interpret domain-specific language accurately. Additionally, technical obstacles such as ensuring interoperability with existing systems and the need for high-quality, domain-specific datasets for fine-tuning present significant hurdles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has largely focused on general applications of LLMs, with limited exploration of their potential in industrial contexts. Barriers include a lack of structured methodologies for integrating LLMs into existing automation frameworks and insufficient datasets for training models on specific industrial tasks. Our approach differs by providing a comprehensive framework that includes system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a systematic method for dataset creation, thereby addressing these gaps and enhancing the applicability of LLMs in industrial automation.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves designing an integral system that utilizes LLMs for controlling and configuring industrial automation equipment. We will implement a proof-of-concept on a physical production system, using metrics such as task execution time and accuracy of generated production plans to evaluate performance. The expected outcomes include a functional LLM-controlled automation system capable of interpreting natural language user tasks, generating production plans, and executing operations on the shop floor, thereby demonstrating the practical utility of LLMs in industrial settings.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: How can we develop a robust framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with digital twin technology and real-time sensor data to create self-adaptive production systems for smart manufacturing?\n\n[Question 2]: This research is of paramount importance as it addresses the growing complexity and dynamism of modern manufacturing environments. By leveraging LLMs to interpret production-specific data and generate optimized process plans, we can significantly enhance the resilience and efficiency of manufacturing systems. The broader implications of solving this problem include the potential for a transformative shift from traditional automation to fully autonomous systems, which can adapt in real-time to anomalies and environmental changes. This work will not only advance knowledge in the fields of industrial automation and artificial intelligence but also pave the way for practical applications that enhance productivity, reduce downtime, and optimize resource allocation in manufacturing settings.\n\n[Question 3]: The challenges in developing this framework are multifaceted. Integrating LLMs with digital twin technology requires a sophisticated understanding of both linguistic processing and the intricate behaviors of manufacturing systems. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of contextualizing sensor data and the need for real-time adaptability in process planning. Technical obstacles include ensuring data integrity from sensors, managing the vast amounts of data generated, and developing algorithms that can efficiently learn and adapt without human intervention. Theoretical challenges arise in modeling the interactions between LLMs and digital twin representations, as well as in defining metrics for evaluating system performance in dynamic environments.\n\n[Question 4]: Previous research has primarily focused on isolated applications of LLMs or digital twin technology, often lacking a comprehensive approach that combines both with real-time sensor data. Limitations in existing solutions include a failure to address the need for self-adaptive mechanisms that can learn from and respond to environmental changes. Barriers such as insufficient integration frameworks, lack of robust algorithms for anomaly detection, and the challenge of real-time data processing have prevented this problem from being solved. Our approach differs by proposing a holistic framework that not only combines these technologies but also incorporates a self-learning mechanism that continuously refines operational parameters based on performance metrics.\n\n[Question 5]: Our proposed methodology includes the development of a framework that utilizes LLMs to analyze real-time sensor data integrated with digital twin models of manufacturing systems. We plan to employ a dataset that encompasses a variety of production scenarios, including normal operations and identified anomalies. The evaluation metrics will focus on system resilience, efficiency improvements, and decision-making accuracy. Expected outcomes include a self-adaptive production system capable of autonomously adjusting process plans in response to real-time data, ultimately leading to enhanced operational efficiency, reduced waste, and improved overall system performance in smart manufacturing environments.", "referenced_intros": [" Introduction\nFoundation models are general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are designed\nto support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures.

Both involve the use of technology to perform \ntasks with minimal or no human intervention , but differ significantly in their flexibility in decision -\nmaking : \n\u2022 Automation : Traditional automated systems generally follow rigid, predefined rules and \nworkflows and are not designed to adapt to changes unless those changes have been \nanticipated and programmed into the system. A usual pre-requisite  of automation lies in \nrepeatability  and predictability, which limits its adaptability to dynamic environments.  \u2022 Autonomy1: on the other hand, autonomy entails  a higher level of adaptability and \ndecision -making capability. An autonomous system can adapt to un -predefined  changes \nand utilize knowledge to make decisions based on available options and system \nobjectives , demonstrating flexibility in problem -solving and task execution , whereas \nautomation typically does not . This concept is commonly applied in fields such as \nintelligent robotics and  artificial intelligence , and  it is also used in political contexts to \ndescribe self -determined individuals or systems that make choices aiming to achieve \noptimal outcomes. [1] \nIn the transition from automation to autonomy, the key differentiator is intelligence \u2014the \ncapability to make informed, dynamic decisions.  This intelligence cannot be practically \nprovided by u sing exhaustive rules due to the unpredictability and variability of real -world \nenvironments. Such rules cannot cover every possible scenario  and often struggle with \ngranularity \u2014they can be either too broad, failing to address specific situations, or overly \ndetailed, making them cumbersome to exhaustively implement and maintain. Moreover , \nmaintaining and updating such a com prehensive rule set demands extensive engineering  \neffort. The  technological development in natural language understanding indicates  the \nsuperiority of machine learning with neural networks over  rule-based systems , as the top \nsolutions are all based on  neural networks  [2].  \nLarge language models (LLMs) can  offer the intelligence  to bridge the gap between traditional \nautomation and autonomy in industrial  systems. These models internalize the knowledge \npatterns learned from training data conveying collective human knowledge , and they are \ncapable of  interpreting complex text and performing dynamic reasoning  based on the given \ninput . Their  general  adaptability allows them to respond to new situations and conditions \nwithout the need for specific re -training . \nIncorporating LLMs into industrial automation systems empowers us to utilize their capabilities \nin performing  diverse  tasks within industrial automation , further reduc ing the need for human \nintervention in tasks that require intelligence. LLMs are particularly effective in extracting \nimportant information from vast datasets, comprehending texts, making reasoning, solving \nproblems, and supporting decision -making processes  [3]. By enabling these models to perform \nintelligent information process ing based on real -time data, they can swiftly adapt to changes, \nthereby boosting efficiency and productivity.  \nIn the following sections,  we explore the integration of LLMs", " Introduction\n\u201cAn autonomous agent is a system situated within and a\npart of an environment that senses that environment and\nacts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so\nas to e ffect what it senses in the future. \u201d\nFranklin and Graesser (1997)\nAutonomous agents have long been recognized\nas a promising approach to achieving artificial gen-\neral intelligence (AGI), which is expected to ac-\nReceived month dd, yyyy; accepted month dd, yyyy\nE-mail: xu.chen@ruc.edu.cn;yankailin@ruc.edu.cn\n*Both authors contribute equally to this paper.arXiv:2308.11432v5  [cs.AI]  4 Apr 20242 Front.

In previous studies, the agents are assumed\nto act based on simple and heuristic policy func-\ntions, and learned in isolated and restricted envi-\nronments [1 \u20136]. Such assumptions significantly\ndiffers from the human learning process, since the\nhuman mind is highly complex, and individuals can\nlearn from a much wider variety of environments.\nBecause of these gaps, the agents obtained from\nthe previous studies are usually far from replicat-\ning human-level decision processes, especially in\nunconstrained, open-domain settings.\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs)\nhave achieved notable successes, demonstrating sig-\nnificant potential in attaining human-like intelli-\ngence [5 \u201310]. This capability arises from lever-\naging comprehensive training datasets alongside a\nsubstantial number of model parameters. Build-\ning upon this capability, there has been a growingresearch area that employs LLMs as central con-\ntrollers to construct autonomous agents to obtain\nhuman-like decision-making capabilities [11\u201317].\nComparing with reinforcement learning, LLM-\nbased agents have more comprehensive internal\nworld knowledge, which facilitates more informed\nagent actions even without training on specific do-\nmain data. Additionally, LLM-based agents can\nprovide natural language interfaces to interact with\nhumans, which is more flexible and explainable.\nAlong this direction, researchers have developed\nnumerous promising models (see Figure 1 for an\noverview of this field), where the key idea is to equip\nLLMs with crucial human capabilities like memory\nand planning to make them behave like humans\nand complete various tasks e ffectively.

This leads  the manufacturer to  consider  \ndiversif ying their product s and provid ing customized \nmanufacturing services , which requires an agile production \nsystem  and efficient management of  the complexity  of the  \nproductio n.  \nHowever, there are several technical challenges for \ndeployment of agile and flexible  production in reality : First of \nall, flexible production requires  seamless integration  of \ndiverse technologies solu tion, e.g., robotics, automation, \nplanning algorithms et c. Secondly,  the production equipment \nand manufacturing  processes need to  be reconfigu rable  \n[1][2], which requires  modular processes  and systems  as well as reconfigurable machines . Furthermore,  automated flexible \nproduction also requires  quick changeover  [3] after decision -\nmaking  to adapt the production against the changing \nrequirements . Eventually , a highly  knowledgeable  \nworkforce  in every complicated technology  with high \navailability to manage and supervise  the complex  system  is \ntoo luxurious to be true . Traditional production systems \nfrequently face difficulties in fulfilling these requirements due \nto their inflexible  [1], dedicated workflows and restricted \nadaptability , as well as the absence of domain -specific \nknowledge in  reconfiguring the production facility .  \nTo tackle these challenges and requi rements, we propose a \nnovel solution: a large language model (LLM) enhanced \nautomated modular production system  for flexible \nmanufacturing .  \nOur messages and contributions from this paper are \nsummarized as follows:  \n(1) We demonstrate with a representative use case \nexplaining why and how large language models  can \nbe used to achieve a higher level of intelligence  and \nadaptability  of industrial automation systems  by \nplanning and controlling the production , especially in \nthe context of flexible  production scenarios.  \n(2) We structure the system design according to  the \nautomation pyramid , illustrating a feasible technical \napproach to integrate LLM s into automation system . \n(3) We prefer  the more scalable  in-context -learning \napproach over the fine-tuning approach , and t he task -\nspecific knowledge  is injected into a LLM in prompt.   \nAs prompt engineering  is an emerging field with little \nstandardization , we devise  a structured prompt \ntemplate for this use case, drawing on insights from \nexisting research in Natural Language Processing . \nII. BACKGROUND  \nIn this section, we start by discussing why and how  \nmodular production systems can meet the requirements  \nseamless integratio n and reconfigurability  for flexible \nproduction. Then we  emphasize  the importance of modular \nquery and control interfaces to allow  the LLM  to access \ninformation about the physical production processes and to \nadapt the production to changing requirements.

Our mitigations and processes alter GPT-4\u2019s behavior and prevent certain\nkinds of misuses, though they have limitations, pointing to the need for anticipatory planning and\ngovernance[ 11] and further safety research. Our approach to deployment balances minimizing risk\nfrom deployment, enabling positive use cases, and learning from deployment.\nGPT models are often trained in two stages. First, they are trained, using a large dataset of text\nfrom the Internet, to predict the next word. The models are then \ufb01ne-tuned with additional data,\nusing an algorithm called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to produce outputs\nthat are preferred by human labelers.[ 10,12,13] Training language models on large text datasets\nhas given rise to capabilities such as few-shot learning[ 10] and the ability to carry out a wide range\nof natural language tasks spanning di\ufb00erent domains, including question answering, arithmetic, and\nclassi\ufb01cation. Fine-tuning has made these models more controllable and useful.\n1.1 Overview of \ufb01ndings and mitigations\nIn this system card,1we outline the safety challenges that arise from GPT-4, and explain the\ninterventions we implemented to mitigate potential harms from its deployment. We focus on safety\nchallenges not because they necessarily outweigh the potential bene\ufb01ts,2but because we wish to\nmotivate further work in safety measurement, mitigation, and assurance. The scope of this system\ncard is narrower than the potential scope of abilities GPT-4 can be used to unlock; notably, both\ncustom \ufb01ne-tuning and image capabilities are explicitly out of scope.\nWe focus on analyzing two versions of the model: an early version \ufb01ne-tuned for instruction\nfollowing (\u201cGPT-4-early\u201d); and a version \ufb01ne-tuned for increased helpfulness and harmlessness[ 18]\nthat re\ufb02ects the further mitigations outlined in this system card (\u201cGPT-4-launch\u201d).3When we\ndiscuss the risks of GPT-4 we will often refer to the behavior of GPT-4-early, because it re\ufb02ects the\nrisks of GPT-4 when minimal safety mitigations are applied. In most cases, GPT-4-launch exhibits\nmuch safer behavior due to the safety mitigations we applied.\nKnown risks associated with smaller language models are also present with GPT-4. GPT-4\ncan generate potentially harmful content, such as advice on planning attacks or hate speech. It\ncan represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the users\nintent,4or of widely shared values. It can also generate code that is compromised or vulnerable.\nThe additional capabilities of GPT-4 also lead to new risk surfaces.\nTo understand the extent of these risks, we engaged more than 50 experts to help us gain a more\nrobust understanding of the GPT-4 model and potential deployment risks. We selected these areas\n1This document takes inspiration from the concepts of model cards and system cards.[ 14,15,16] This document\noften takes the system level of analysis, with that system including non-model mitigations such as use policies, access\ncontrols, and", "ABSTRACT\nWhile large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance\nacross tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their\nabilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action\nplan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we\nexplore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speci\ufb01c actions\nin an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning\ntraces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle\nexceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information\nfrom external sources such as knowledge bases or environments.

Concretely, on question\nanswering (HotpotQA) and fact veri\ufb01cation (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent\nissues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by\ninteracting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving\ntrajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.\nFurthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and\nWebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learningmethods degrade soon after \ufb01netuning.\nB.2 A LFWORLD IM-S TYLE DETAILS\nFor the IM-style ablation, the same expert trajectories used in ReAct are reannotated with dense\nexternal feedback thoughts within these trajectories, that limit ReAct-IM to only think about (1)\ndecomposing the current goal and (2) the current subgoal that needs to be completed. In particular,\nReAct-IM lacks thoughts that (1) determine when a subgoal is completed (2) determine what the\nnext subgoal should be (3) inducing the LLM to refer to its internal pretraining knowledge to identify\nwhere items can be within the environment.\n15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nC P ROMPTS\nC.1 H OTPOT QA\nHotpot QA Prompts\nOrig inal\nQuestion What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the\nColorado orogeny extends into?\nAnswer 1,800 to 7,000 ft\nQuestion Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\"\ncharacter Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nAnswer Richard Nixon\nQuestion Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The\nSaimaa Gesture?\nAnswer The Saimaa Gesture\nQuestion What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nAnswer director, screenwriter, actor\nQuestion Which magazine was started first Arthur\u2019s Magazine or First for Women?\nAnswer Arthur\u2019s Magazine\nQuestion Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nAnswer Yes\nAct\nQuestion What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the\nColorado orogeny extends into?\nAction 1 Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1 The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in\nColorado and surrounding areas.\nAction 2 Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2 (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called\nthe Central Plains orogeny.\nAction 3 Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3 High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nAction 4 Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4 The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains.

As\nwe pre-train larger models, full \ufb01ne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example \u2013 deploying indepen-\ndent instances of \ufb01ne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B \ufb01ne-tuned with Adam,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than \ufb01ne-\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\nno additional inference latency . We also provide an empirical investigation into\nrank-de\ufb01ciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the ef\ufb01cacy of\nLoRA.

Such adaptation is usually done via \ufb01ne-tuning ,\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model.

{"paper_key": "Graph Reasoning with Large Language Models via Pseudo-code Prompting", "current_5q": "### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nCan large language models (LLMs) effectively reason with graph structures when provided with natural language prompts, and what are the limitations of their performance in this context?\n\n### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nSolving this problem is crucial for advancing the understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in reasoning tasks that involve structured data, such as graphs. By addressing this question, the research community can gain insights into the potential of LLMs to handle complex reasoning tasks, which could lead to improved applications in various fields, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and knowledge representation. Furthermore, understanding how LLMs interact with graph structures could inform the development of more efficient prompting techniques and enhance the models' applicability in real-world scenarios, ultimately contributing to the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent complexities of graph structures and the limitations of LLMs in processing structured data. Naive approaches may fail because LLMs are primarily designed for unstructured text and may not adequately capture the relationships and logical entailments present in graphs. Additionally, the performance of LLMs can significantly degrade with larger graph sizes, and they struggle with specific tasks, such as counting edges. Overcoming these technical obstacles requires a nuanced understanding of both LLM architecture and graph theory, as well as the development of effective prompting strategies that can leverage pseudo-code to enhance reasoning capabilities.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on the application of LLMs to unstructured text, with limited exploration of their reasoning capabilities in graph contexts. Existing studies have not fully addressed the specific challenges posed by graph structures, such as the impact of graph size on performance and the effectiveness of different prompting techniques. Barriers to solving this problem include a lack of comprehensive methodologies for evaluating LLMs on graph-related tasks and insufficient exploration of how pseudo-code can influence performance across different models. Our approach differs by systematically investigating these aspects and providing a comparative analysis of LLM performance with various prompting strategies.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves evaluating LLMs on a series of graph-related tasks using natural language prompts and pseudo-code. We will utilize a diverse dataset of graphs, varying in size and complexity, to assess the models' reasoning capabilities. The key metrics for evaluation will include accuracy in", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question we aim to address is: How can a hybrid model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) enhance the understanding and real-time analysis of user-generated content on social media platforms for improved sentiment analysis and community detection?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nThis research is significant as it addresses the growing need for effective mental health support systems that can process multilingual user-generated content on social media, which is a critical area of concern given the increasing prevalence of mental health issues exacerbated by online interactions. By combining the strengths of LLMs in understanding context and sentiment with GNNs' ability to analyze relational structures in data, this hybrid model can significantly improve the efficacy of analysis tools used by mental health professionals and researchers. The implications for the research community are profound; successful implementation could lead to advancements in natural language processing, community detection, and sentiment analysis, thereby influencing future research methodologies and applications in social media analytics, mental health monitoring, and user engagement strategies.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nSolving this problem involves several challenges and complexities. First, the integration of LLMs and GNNs requires overcoming technical hurdles related to the compatibility of data formats and the alignment of temporal and structural data. Naive approaches, such as treating textual and relational data independently, may fail to capture the nuanced interactions between user sentiments and their social connections. Additionally, the dynamic nature of social media interactions, where user behaviors and relationships evolve continuously, poses practical obstacles in maintaining an up-to-date understanding of these interactions. The model must incorporate dynamic feedback mechanisms to adapt to these changes, which adds another layer of complexity to the design and implementation.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either LLMs or GNNs in isolation, often resulting in a compartmentalized approach that fails to leverage the contextual interplay between textual and relational data. Existing models typically do not account for the evolving nature of social interactions or the rich, multilingual context of user-generated content on social media. Moreover, many studies have not fully explored the potential of hybrid models that combine both LLMs and GNNs. This proposal addresses these gaps by introducing a novel hybrid architecture that integrates contextual embeddings from LLMs with structural embeddings from GNNs, thereby enhancing the understanding of complex user interactions in a way that prior work has not achieved.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid model that utilizes LLMs for processing textual data and GNNs for analyzing the relational structures within user interactions. We will collect a diverse dataset of user-generated content from various social media platforms, ensuring multilingual representation. The model will be evaluated using metrics such as sentiment accuracy and community detection precision, comparing its performance against traditional methods and existing models.

In GSL,\nthe primary focus lies in unraveling the latent rela-\ntionships and dependencies that may not be imme-\ndiately discernible from the raw data. By generat-\ning these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us\nto gain a more comprehensive understanding of the\ndata, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks,\nsuch as node classification (Zhao et al., 2021a).In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave indeed captured significant attention and pop-\nularity due to their remarkable capacity to model\nand leverage relationships within graph-structured\ndata (Garg et al., 2020; Buterez et al., 2022). GNNs\nexcel in learning node-level representations by ef-\nfectively aggregating and propagating information\nfrom neighboring nodes in a graph. This excep-\ntional capability has sparked a revolution in the\nanalysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the underlying\nnode-wise connection patterns and interactions.\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intri-\ncate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly\npropelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the\nforefront of graph structure learning (Zhou et al.,\n2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS (Fatemi\net al., 2021), Nodeformer (Wu et al., 2022), and\nGT (Shi et al., 2021) incorporate neural networks\nthat collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph\nstructures. These models undergo co-optimization,\nensuring a seamless and integrated learning pro-\ncess.

GSR (Zhao et al., 2023),\nSTABLE (Li et al., 2022), and SUBLIME (Liu\net al., 2022b) are advanced pre-training models\nspecifically designed to refine graph quality and\nenhance the effectiveness of graph representation\nlearning. The training process involves two stages:\nfirst, enhancing the graph structure through pre-\ntraining, and then utilizing this refined structure to\ntrain GNNs for various downstream tasks.\nIter-Training Models . SEGSL (Zou et al., 2023),\nCoGSL (Liu et al., 2022a), and GEN (Wang et al.,\n2021a) employ the iterative training where two\ncomponents are developed simultaneously. They\nadaptively learn the graph structure based on pre-\ndictions or representations generated by an opti-\nmized GNN. The learned structure is then used to\ntrain a new GNN model in the subsequent iteration.\nCo-Training Models . Notable examples of co-\ntraining models include Nodeformer (Wu et al.,\n2022), WSGNN (Lao et al., 2022), GT (Shi et al.,\n2021), SLAPS (Fatemi et al., 2021), Gaug (Zhao\net al.,", " INTRODUCTION\nGraphs, as a general data structure containing nodes and edges, are\nubiquitous in various real-world scenarios such as molecular graphs\nin chemistry [ 13,18] and social networks [ 24]. In the real world, the\ntext-attributed graph (TAG) is also representative, which integrates\nboth graph topological structure and text, enabling them to contain\nricher semantics. To effectively learn graph-structured data, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) have emerged. They introduce a message-\npassing mechanism to aggregate features from neighboring nodes,\nallowing the simultaneous incorporation of graph topology and\nnode features [8, 28].\nNote that GNNs only accept numerical features, whereas the\nattributes of nodes in TAGs are always in text format. Therefore,\nit is necessary to convert the textual attributes of nodes into em-\nbeddings that can be directly input into GNNs. In the classic GNN\npipeline, the text attributes of nodes are usually encoded as shallow\nembeddings, such as by FastText [ 14] and Word2Vec [ 23]. However,\nrecent studies argue that shallow embeddings have several limi-\ntations, such as the inability to effectively capture sentence-level\nsemantics [ 22] and inadequacy in handling the phenomenon of\npolysemy [ 27]. To overcome them, recent works have introduced\ntext encoding methods into the process of GNN\ntraining.

The emergence of potent\nmodels such as ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al. 2023) has led to substantial influences on many\nareas like society, commerce, and research. However, LLMs\nstill suffer from severe factual hallucination problems, i.e.,\nLLMs can frequently generate unsupported false statements\nregarding factual information due to their lack of intrinsic\nknowledge (Ji et al. 2023). For example, in Figure 1, Chat-\nGPT fails to provide an accurate response to the query \u201c When\nis Fr\u00b4ed\u00b4eric Chopin\u2019s father\u2019s birthday? \u201d due to a wrong belief\nthat Nicolas Chopin\u2019s birthday is on June 17, 1771. Factual\nhallucination poses a severe challenge for LLM applications,\nparticularly in real-world situations where factual accuracy\nholds significance. Consequently, the endeavor to alleviate\nfactual hallucinations in LLMs has become a research hotspot\nin NLP field (Liu et al. 2021; Kang and Hashimoto 2020).\n*These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright \u00a92024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.On the other hand, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store a sub-\nstantial amount of high-quality factual information, which\ncan significantly alleviate factual hallucination if incorpo-\nrated with LLMs. For example, in Figure 1, we can retrofit\nthe erroneous statement \u201c Nicolas Chopin was born on June\n17, 1771 \u201d by referring to the provided factual knowledge\n\u201c(Nicolas Chopin, date of birth, 1771-04-15T00:00:0) \u201d in\nWikidata. Recent work has focused on integrating LLMs\nwith KGs by retrieving the entities in the query within knowl-\nedge graphs. Then the obtained factual triples are utilized\nas an additional context for LLMs to enhance their factual\nknowledge (Baek, Aji, and Saffari 2023; Chase 2022). Un-\nfortunately, these approaches are limited to retrieving factual\nknowledge relevant to entities explicitly mentioned within\nthe given query. However, the fundamental capability of large\nlanguage models involves intricate and multi-step reasoning.\nSuch reasoning processes often necessitate the validation and\naugmentation of factual knowledge that may be employed\nduring the reasoning process. For example, in the case shown\nin Figure 1, LLM fails to answer the question because it\nrequires an intermediate knowledge about \u201c Nicolas Chopin\nwas born on April 15, 1771 \u201d. However, such information\ndoes not refer to entities appearing in the query. As a result,\nprevious approaches are inadequate in addressing the factual\nhallucination appearing in the reasoning processes of LLMs.\nIn this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph-based\nRetrofitting (KGR), a new framework that incorporates LLMs\nwith KGs to mitigate factual hallucination during the entire\nreasoning process of LLMs. Instead of retrieving factual in-\nformation from KGs using original queries, the main idea\nbehind KGR is to autonomously retrofit the initial draft re-\nsponses of LLMs based on the factual knowledge stored in\nKGs. However, achieving the above process is challenging\nbecause draft responses generated by large language mod-\nels typically contain a mixture of various information about\nthe reasoning process, making the extraction, verification,\nand revision of relevant knowledge in it very challenging.\nTherefore, the key to integrating Knowledge Graphs into the\nreasoning process of large models to mitigate factual halluci-\nnations lies in efficiently extracting the information requiring\nvalidation from draft responses, querying and selecting rele-\nvant knowledge from the knowledge graphs, and using thisarXiv:2311.13314v1  [cs.CL]  22 Nov 2023Claim \nExtractionEntity\nDetectionFact\nSelectionClaim\nVerificationResponse\nRetrofitting\nRetrofitted response\nFr\u00e9 d\u00e9 ric Chopin's father is\nNicolas Chopin, hewas born\nonApril 15,1771 .\nClaim 1 .

LLMs can be treated\nas foundation models that can be readily applied to diverse d ownstream tasks with little adapta-\ntion [5, 18, 21]. These models have achieved state-of-the-a rt results demon-\nstrate that while LLMs exhibit reasonable node classi\ufb01cati on capabilities even without explicit graph\ndata, likely by relying on contextual clues, their zero-sho t performance continues to lag behind state-\nof-the-art GNNs specialized for this domain.

Unfortunately, a comprehensive examination of LLMs\u2019 capacity to extract and harness cru-\ncial topological structures across diverse prompt setting s, task levels, and datasets remains underex-\nplored. Both Chen et al.[7] and Guo et al.[13] proposed to app ly LLMs directly on graph data.

In addition, Ye et al.[44] \ufb01ne-tuned LLMs on a designated dataset\nto outperform GNN, underscoring a distinct research object ive compared", " introduction\nto variational RELATED WORK\nA.2.1 LLM R EASONING PROMPT\nMany studies have been proposed to harness the reasoning ability of LLMs to handle complex tasks\nthrough prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023; Pan et al.,\n2023; Zheng et al., 2023d; Jin et al., 2024a;b). Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) enables LLMs\nto generate a reasoning chain that could be helpful to reasoning. Tree of thoughts (Yao et al., 2023)\nexpands the reasoning chain to a tree structure to explore more reasoning paths. Graph of thoughts\n(Besta et al., 2023) further models the reasoning chain as a graph with an aggregation operation to\nsynergize the reasoning paths. Plan-and-solve (Wang et al., 2023c) prompts LLMs to generate a plan\nand execute based on it. DecomP (He et al., 2021) prompts LLMs to decompose the reasoning task\ninto a series of sub-tasks and solve them step by step. However, the problem of hallucinations and\nlack of knowledge affect the faithfulness of the reasoning. ReACT (Yao et al., 2022) treats LLMs\nas agents, which interact with the environment to get the latest knowledge for reasoning. To explore\nfaithful reasoning, Entailer (Tafjord et al., 2022) introduces a verifier to validate the reasoning steps\ngenerated by LLMs. Creswell & Shanahan (2022) present a framework including two LLMs that are\nused for selecting and generating reasoning steps, respectively. FAME (Hong et al., 2023) introduces\nthe Monte-Carlo planning to generate faithful reasoning steps. RR (He et al., 2022) and KD-CoT\nWang et al. (2023b) aim to retrieve relevant knowledge from KGs to produce faithful reasoning\nplans for LLMs. Think-on-Graph (Sun et al., 2024) and KG-Agent (Jiang et al., 2024) treat LLMs\nas agents to interact with KGs via prompting to get the latest knowledge for reasoning.\n15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nA.2.2 K NOWLEDGE GRAPH QUESTION ANSWERING\nKnowledge graphs contain abundant factual knowledge in a structured format, which has attracted\ngreat attention from researchers (Zheng et al., 2022a; 2023a; Pan et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023).\nKnowledge graph reasoning aims to derive new insights based on the existing graph structure and\nfacts (Liang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a; Luo et al., 2023b; Zhao et al., 2023).

This limitation\narises because graphs encapsulate distinct relational data, making it challenging\nto transform them into natural language that LLMs understand. In this paper,\nwe bridge this gap with a novel framework, G RAPH TEXT, that translates graphs\nto natural language. G RAPH TEXT derives a graph-syntax tree for each graph that\nencapsulates both the node attributes and inter-node relationships. Traversal of the\ntree yields a graph text sequence, which is then processed by an LLM to treat graph\ntasks as text generation tasks. Notably, G RAPH TEXT offers multiple advantages.\nIt introduces training-free graph reasoning : even without training on graph data,\nGRAPH TEXT with ChatGPT can achieve on par with, or even surpassing, the per-\nformance of supervised-trained graph neural networks through in-context learning\n(ICL). Furthermore, G RAPH TEXT paves the way for interactive graph reasoning ,\nallowing both humans and LLMs to communicate with the model seamlessly us-\ning natural language. These capabilities underscore the vast, yet-to-be-explored\npotential of LLMs in the domain of graph machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nLanguage stands as a cornerstone of human civilization, acting as the primary medium for knowl-\nedge encoding, reasoning, and communication. Large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on\nextensive text corpora, have showcased remarkable reasoning skills (Brown et al., 2020; Bubeck\net al., 2023). These LLMs can communicate via natural language both internally (Wei et al., 2022)\nand externally with humans or other LLMs (Li et al., 2023), demonstrating exceptional skills such\nas multi-step reasoning (Yao et al., 2023a), decision-making (Yao et al., 2023b; Liang et al., 2023),\ntool use (Schick et al., 2023), and multi-agent collaboration (Park et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023).\nMotivation. Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in handling natural languages, their appli-\ncation to other data modalities presents unique challenges, primarily because these data often lack\nstraightforward transformation into sequential text. These challenges are especially severe when\ndealing with graph-structured data, as different graphs define structure and features in distinct ways.\nTherefore, existing efforts within the graph machine learning field commonly require the training of\nspecific graph neural networks (GNNs) tailored to individual graphs (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Velick-\novic et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Often, models trained on one graph cannot generalize to the\nunseen structure and feature representations of other graphs. Moreover, the gap between graphs and\nhuman languages hinders the application of natural language reasoning to facilitate graph reasoning.\nIn light of these limitations, a question arises: can we derive a language for graph in natural lan-\nguage? In this paper, we give an affirmative answer by proposing to use treeas an intermediary,\nelegantly bridging structured data and one-dimensional sequential language. Essentially, a tree ex-\nhibits a hierarchical structure, and traversing it yields a one-dimensional sequence. On top of that,\nas shown in Figure 1 (c), we propose a novel framework G RAPH TEXT, which takes graph data to\nbuild a graph-syntax tree. Traversing itresults in Table 4.1,\naccompanied by the explanations of reasoning above, indicates that a deep-seated bias - where the\ncentral node is viewed as the most vital", " introduction\n(Sec. 1). For a clear statement, we split and reformat them into the following research questions. Q1:\nHow much could SimTeG generally improve the learning of GNNs on node classification and link\nprediction? Q2: Does X-SimTeG facilitate better convergence for GNNs? Q3: Is PEFT a necessity\nfor LM finetuning stage? Q4: How sensitive is GNN training sensitive to the selection of LMs?\nDatasets.

Pseudo-code is an\ninformal set of code-like constructs, which tend to\nbe easy to interpret for humans but are not neces-\nsarily compilable/executable. They are often used\nto express complex ideas, processes, and flows \u2013\nfor example, Algorithm 1 expresses a summarized\nversion of what happens within a Multi-Head At-\ntention block (Vaswani et al., 2017) in pseudo-code.\nArguably, expressing the same ideas in natural lan-\nguage could result in ambiguity and would perhaps\nrequire detailed text for clarity, which adds to the\ncomplexity.\nIn light of recent successes in NLP tasks\nachieved by code models (Madaan et al., 2022;\nZhang et al., 2023a,b), this study aims to exam-\nine the efficacy of using pseudo-code instructions\nfor prompting as a means of enhancing model per-\nformance. This study is driven by the hypothesis\nthat using pseudo-code as prompts could offer a\nnatural advantage to models in NLP tasks, owing\nto the concise and clearer expression of ideas in\npseudo-code. To test the hypothesis that prompt-\ning large language models with pseudo-code in-\nstead of natural language data could be helpful,\nwe created pseudo-code prompts2for132different\ntasks spanning 28 distinct task types, sourced from\nthe Super-NaturalInstructions dataset (Wang et al.,\n2022b) (see Listing 1 for an example). Using these\nprompts along with", " Introduction\nOriginally designed for textual data, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for\ntasks beyond language processing. In robotics and planning, LLMs are adopted to guide agents\nthrough structured environments [Huang et al., 2022, Andreas, 2022]. In theory-of-mind reasoning,\nLLMs are required to maintain and update local and global graphs that reflect the beliefs of different\ncharacters [Adhikari et al., 2020, Ammanabrolu and Riedl, 2021]. In structured commonsense\nreasoning, LLMs are expected to generate graph-based action plans to achieve objectives with\ndiversified prerequisites [Tandon et al., 2019, Madaan et al., 2022]. In multi-hop question answering,\nLLMs implicitly find connections and paths among a vast network of entities and concepts [Creswell\net al., 2023]. Together these works demonstrate that LLMs are widely adopted for tasks with implicit\ngraphical structures while achieving preliminary success. However, one underlying yet crucial\nquestion remains underexplored: Can LLMs reason with graphs? More concretely, are LLMs capable\nof mapping textual descriptions of graphs and structures to grounded conceptual spaces and solving\n\u2217equal contribution\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2305.10037v3  [cs.CL]  6 Jan 2024graph algorithm problems explicitly with natural language? The answer to this question has profound\nimplications for large language model applications with implicit graphs and structures, the reasoning\nability of LLMs in advanced and graph-based settings, and more.\nTo this end, we propose the Natural Language Graph (NLGraph) benchmark, a comprehensive testbed\nof graph and structured reasoning designed for language models and in natural language. NLGraph\ncontains a total of 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity\nfrom intuitively simple tasks such as connectivity ,cycle , and shortest path to more complex problems\nsuch as topological sort ,maximum flow ,bipartite graph matching ,Hamilton path , and simulating\ngraph neural networks . We control for problem difficulty through generated graph size, network\nsparsity, numeric range, and more, presenting easy, medium, and hard subsets in each distinct graph\nreasoning task to enable fine-grained analysis. In addition to using exact match accuracy as a standard\nmetric, we also design several partial credit solutions for various graph reasoning tasks.\nWith the NLGraph benchmark, we evaluate whether various large language models [Brown et al.,\n2020, Ouyang et al., 2022, Bubeck et al., 2023] could perform graph-based reasoning and whether\ndifferent prompting techniques [Brown et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2022, Kojima et al., 2022, Zhou et al.,\n2023, Wang et al., 2023] improve the graph reasoning abilities of large language models. Extensive experiments. Since\nwe will make the NLGraph benchmark publicly available, we leave it to future work on evaluating\nthe graph reasoning abilities of other open-source LLMs.\nLimited dataset size. Due to monetary costs, we only evaluate LLMs on the standard version of the\nNLGraph benchmark which has 5,902 problems throughout the paper. We believe evaluating LLMs\non the extended version of the NLGraph benchmark, with 5x more problems, may bring stronger\nproof to the findings we present. methods such as asking LLMs to generate and execute code, or\nsimulating steps of algorithmic solutions while maintaining the state variables.\nC NLGraph Details\nIn Table 6, we provide the details of the NLGraph benchmark including edge probabilities and\nspecific values of parameters mentioned in \u00a72.2.\n14Subset Connect.

Judge GPT-4 often\nrationalizes this length as (a) providing more detailed information, or (b) providing plausible alternatives.\nHowever, the answers created by GPT-3 are relatively shorter and Judge GPT-4 downweights this. Addition-\nally, the instructions for Judge GPT-4 explicitly state that one of the options must be picked , which further\npushes the model to make certain spurious decisions. It is surprising to note that despite this, the model\noccasionally states that neither answer is correct; this was a rare occurrence. When the human experts were\nquestioned about their rationale, they indicated that they veri\fed if the claim was present in either model-\ngenerated answer (regardless of the length) and picked the option that met this criteria. If no option met this\ncriteria, they picked neither8. Ensuring that models are calibrated like humans for this task requires more\nnuanced (and informative) instructions (through the prompts). Note, however, that the human is also able\nto create categories outside the ontology provided to GPT-4 (behavior that is unfaithful to the instructions).\nIf the human annotator was not allowed to pick \\neither\" or \\none\", then the re-calibrated scores will match\nwhat Judge GPT-4 chooses (the row \\ Human (constrained) \" in Table 6).\n8We do note that the humans performing this task could be biased based on their own experiences and were not checked for\ninter-rater agreement; the \fndings may change factoring these considerations as well.\n758 Limitations of autoregressive architecture highlighted by GPT-4\nAs witnessed in the previous sections, GPT-4 demonstrates impressive capabilities in a wide range of tasks,\nsuch as reasoning, content generation, problem solving, and more. However, as we will show in this section,\nthe model also has several substantial \raws, some of which seem to be inherent to the next-word prediction\nparadigm that underlies its architecture. We will illustrate these \raws with a series of examples and discuss\ntheir implications.\n8.1 Warm-up with two basic examples\nPredicting the next word is a task that relies on working memory and often requires planning ahead. Consider\nthe following example:\nGPT-4\nMerge the content of the next sentences into one sentence.\nThe Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs\nabove 4.5 percent, from near zero. That initially seemed to be slowing consumer and business demand and\nhelping inflation to moderate. But a number of recent economic reports have suggested that inflation did\nnot weaken as much as expected last year and remained faster than expected in January, while other data\nshowed hiring remains strong and consumer spending picked up at the start of the year.a\nMerged sentence:\nDespiteraisinginterestratesatthefastest pacesincethe1980s,fromnearzerotoabove4.5per\ncent,whichinitiallyappearedtoslowconsumerandbusinessdemandandmoderateinflation,theFed\nfacedanumberofrecenteconomicreportsthatindicatedinflationdidnotweakenasmuchasexpected\nlastyearandremainedfasterthanexpectedinJanuary,whilehiringremainedstrongandconsumerspend\ningpickedupatthestartoftheyear.\naThis text is taken from the New York Times, March 7th 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/\nbusiness/economy/fed-powell-interest-rates.html\nArguably, the average human would not be able to produce such a concise sentence without taking the\ntime to plan its structure and would likely have to \\backtrack\" (making edits) a few times before reaching the\n\fnal form. Yet the GPT architecture does not allow for such backtracking, which means that producing this\noutput required \\far-ahead\" planning. Due to the forward nature of GPT-4's output production, the only\nway for the model to do such far-ahead planning is to rely", " Introduction\nNumerical reasoning is a long-standing task in artificial intelligence. A surge of datasets has been proposed\nrecently to benchmark deep-learning models\u2019 capabilities to perform numerical/arithmetic reasoning. Some\nwidely used benchmarks are based on Math word problems (MWP) (Cobbe et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021;\nLu et al., 2022; Ling et al., 2017), where systems are supposed to answer math questions expressed with\nnatural text. Besides MWP, some datasets also consider financial problems (Chen et al., 2021b; 2022; Zhu\net al., 2021), where systems need to answer math-driven financial questions.\nPrior work (Ling et al., 2017; Cobbe et al., 2021) has studied how to train models from scratch or fine-tune\nmodels to generate intermediate steps to derive the final answer. Such methods can work efficiently on numerical reasoning tasks\nlike math or finance problem solving. We also study how to combine PoT with CoT to combine the merits of\nbothpromptingapproaches. We believePoTis suitableforproblems whichrequirehighly symbolic reasoning\nskills. For semantic reasoning tasks like commonsense reasoning (StrategyQA), we conjecture that PoT is\nnot the best option. In contrast, CoT can solve more broader reasoning tasks.\n6 results.\nAmong the 198 failure cases of numerical reasoning questions with the PoT (greedy) method, 47% have value\ngrounding errors and 33% have logic errors. In 15% both types of errors occurred and in 5% we believe the\nanswer is actually correct. We found that the majority of the errors are value grounding errors, which is also\ncommon for other Experiments\n3.1 Experimental Setup\nDatasets We summarize our evaluated datasets in Table 1.

It is because the fully-attentional structure of Transformer is general\nand powerful enough to take, process, and relate inputs and outputs of arbitrary structures, eliminating\na need for data- and task-speci\ufb01c inductive bias to be baked into the network architecture. Combined\nwith large-scale training, it opens up a new chapter for building a versatile model that can solve a wide\nrange of problems involving diverse data modalities and even a mixture of modalities [31, 30, 57].\nIn graph learning domain, inspired by the breakthroughs, multiple works tried combining self-\nattention into graph neural network (GNN) architecture where message passing was previously\ndominant [ 50]. As global self-attention across nodes cannot re\ufb02ect the graph structure, however, these methods such as graph Transformers that rely on dense attention bias.\nDataset We use transductive node classi\ufb01cation datasets, where each data is represented as a node in\na large-scale graph, including co-authorship (CS, Physics) [ 61], co-purchase (Photo, Computers) [ 61],\nand Wikipedia page networks (Chameleon, Crocodile) [ 59]. We randomly split the dataset into train,\nvalidation, and test sets by randomly reserving 30 random nodes per class for validation and test\nrespectively, and use the rest of the nodes for training. Dataset statistics is provided in Table 4.\n26Approach We utilize simple variants of TokenGT with Performer kernel attention of O(n+m)\ncomplexity. Due to the large number of nodes n, an immediate challenge for TokenGT is dealing\nwith the orthonormality assumption on the node identi\ufb01ers (Lemma 1) as the maximal number of\northonormal node identi\ufb01ers is bounded by dimension dp. In this case, it is reasonable to introduce\nnear-orthonormal vectors as node identi\ufb01ers, as it is theoretically guaranteed that we can draw\nan exponential number O(e\n(dp))ofdp-dimensional near-orthonormal vectors [ 22]. For TokenGT\n(Near-ORF) , we usedp= 64 -dimensional random node identi\ufb01ers where each entry is sampled\nfromf\u00001=dp;+1=dpgwith coin toss [ 22]. For TokenGT (Lap) , we use a subset of the Laplacian\neigenvectors as node identi\ufb01ers, speci\ufb01cally dp=2eigenvectors with lowest eigenvalues and dp=2\neigenvectors with highest eigenvalues, and choose dpamong 64-100based on validation performance.\nWhile Near-ORF andLap can theoretically serve as an ef\ufb01cient low-rank approximation for or-\nthonormal node identi\ufb01ers, their approximation can affect the quality of modeled equivariant basis\n(Section 3). In particular, equivariant basis ( \u0016) represented as sparse basis tensor ( B\u0016; De\ufb01nition 4)\nare expected to be affected more, as they require most entries to be zero. To remedy this, we take a\nsimple approach of residually adding one of such sparse equivariant operators Xii7!Xii+P\nj6=iXij\nexplicitly after each Transformer layer. We denote this variant as TokenGT (Lap) + Performer + SEB ,\nwhere SEB abbreviates sparse equivariant basis. This \ufb01x is minimal, easy to implement, and highly\nef\ufb01cient as it only requires a single torch.coalesce() call, and also empirically effective.\nArchitecture All our models in Table 5 utilize a linear prediction head on the node tokens obtained\nat the \ufb01nal Transformer layer to perform node-level classi\ufb01cation. We perform an exploratory\nhyperparameter search over the number of layers from 2-4, headsHfrom 1-4, hidden dimension d\nfrom", " Introduction\nFollowing the remarkable success of few-shot\nprompting over large language models (e.g. Brown\net al., 2020), recent studies on prompting meth-\nods suggest that LMs\u2019 reasoning capability can be\nfurther promoted by generating a sequence of ex-\nplanation for a given problem, prior to inferring\nthe answer (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022;\nLiu et al., 2021). The so-called explanation-based\nprompting helps an LM better elicit its knowledge\nand reason by leveraging its own generated expla-\nnations - whether it be commonsense knowledge\n(Liu et al., 2021), a solution for a math word prob-\n1We share our code at https://github.com/jaehunjung1/\nMaieutic-Prompting .\nExplanation-based PromptingInput Prompt Q: Captain Kirk is part of Star Wars?

However, we \ufb01nd that this intuition\nis faulty in practice, as model-generated explana-\ntions are often logically inconsistent and unreliable.\nFor example, we manually inspected 100 samples\nfrom a QA task (Figure 1) and found that for a\nconsiderable number of cases, (1) the explanation\ndoes not logically lead to the inferred answer, (2)\nthe model infers the same label for a statement\nand its negation (Kassner and Sch\u00fctze, 2020), and\n(3) falsi\ufb01es its own generated explanation. These\n\ufb01ndings raise fundamental questions on the role of\nexplanations in LM inference: If the explanation\nis correct - is there a guarantee that the LM will\ninfer a label consistent with the explanation?

Compared to\nthese approaches, self-consistency is far simpler and requires no additional training. The approach\nwe propose simply couples the generation of reasoning paths and a \ufb01nal answer by sampling from\nthe decoder, using aggregation to recover the most consistent answer without additional modules.\nConsistency in language models. Some prior work has shown that language models can suffer\nfrom inconsistency in conversation (Adiwardana et al., 2020), explanation generation (Camburu et al.,\n2020), and factual knowledge extraction (Elazar et al., 2021). Welleck et al. (2020) use \u201cconsistency\u201d\nto refer to generating an in\ufb01nite-length sequence in recurrent language models. Nye et al. (2021)\nimprove the logical consistency of samples from a System 1 model by adding a System 2-inspired\nlogical reasoning module. In this paper we focus on a slightly different notion of \u201cconsistency\u201d, i.e.,\nutilizing answer consistency among diverse reasoning paths to improve accuracy.\n5 C ONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nWe introduced a simple yet effective method called self-consistency, and observed that it signi\ufb01cantly\nimproves accuracy in a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, across four large\nlanguage models with varying scales. Beyond accuracy gains, self-consistency is also useful for\ncollecting rationales when performing reasoning tasks with language models, and for providing\nuncertainty estimates and improved calibration of language model outputs.\nOne limitation of self-consistency is that it incurs more computation cost. In practice people can try a\nsmall number of paths (e.g., 5 or 10) as a starting point to realize most of the gains while not incurring\ntoo much cost, as in most cases the performance saturates quickly (Figure 2). As part of future work,\none could use self-consistency to generate better supervised data to \ufb01ne-tune the model, such that the\nmodel can give more accurate predictions in a single inference run after \ufb01ne-tuning. In addition, we\nobserved that language models can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical reasoning paths (e.g.,\nthe StrategyQA example in Table 4, the two population numbers are not exactly correct), and further\nwork is needed to better ground models\u2019 rationale generations.\n9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nREPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT\nIn discussion, language models can sometimes generate nonsensical or non-factual\nreasoning paths, so one should use language models\u2019 outputs with extra caution. We deal with\nreasoning tasks mostly and the generated rationales are only used for inspecting how a model reaches\nits answer. One could potentially use the generated rationales to further check why the model makes\ncertain mistakes or whether the model contains any biases when performing a certain task. For\nlanguage model in real-world use, further work is needed to better ground models\u2019 predictions and\nimprove model\u2019s factuality and safety, to ensure the models do not cause harms to users.

There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al.

In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on\nEmpirical Related Work\nWe will focus on three main areas of related work: world modeling and model-based reinforcement\nlearning, and world modeling and knowledge graphs in text games, and general (knowledge) graph\nconstruction techniques.\nWorld modeling via model-based reinforcement learning often serves to learn transition models\nof an environment to allow for simulation without actually interacting with the environment [ 7].\nHa and Schmidhuber [12] use Variational Autoencoders (V AEs) combined with recurrent neural\nnetworks to learn compressed state representations over time of visual reinforcement learning\nenvironments [ 8]. This model is then used to simulate an environment and learn a control policy\nin it. Other contemporary works attempt to also learn dynamics models using raw pixels in the\n2context of games such as Atari [ 26,16], and Super Mario Bros. [ 11] as well as 3D simulations [ 16]\nand robotics [ 37,35]. We note that in all of these works, in addition to the state space being raw\npixels\u2014the action space is \ufb01xed and orders of magnitude smaller than in text games.\nIn textual environments, the traditional state representations of choice have been raw text encodings\nvia recurrent neural networks [ 24,14,13] but have since shifted towards transformer [ 34] and\nknowledge graph-based representations [ 3,1]. Knowledge graphs have been shown to be aid in the\nchallenges of: (1) knowledge representation [ 3,1], enabling neuro-symbolic reasoning approaches\nover graph-based state representations [ 29]; (2) combinatorial state-action spaces [ 2,1]; and (3)\nincorporating external knowledge sources for commonsense reasoning [ 3,21,22,9]. Two of these\nworks are perhaps closest in spirit to ours. Yao et al.

As", " Introduction\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\n\ufb02exible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),", " Introduction.

Dynamic\nGraph Cnn for Learning on Point", " Introduction\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction", " Introduction to the conll-2003 shared task:\nLanguage-independent named entity recognition.

By automating the grading of open-ended questions, educators can provide timely and personalized feedback, enhancing student learning outcomes. This advancement could lead to more frequent assessments, allowing for better tracking of student progress and skill mastery. Furthermore, it could democratize access to quality education by reducing the burden on educators, particularly in resource-limited settings, and could inspire future research into the application of LLMs in diverse educational contexts.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in automating the grading of open-ended responses include the inherent complexity of natural language understanding, the variability in student responses, and the need for models to generalize across different educational contexts. Naive approaches may fail due to the nuanced nature of language and the potential for diverse interpretations of student answers. Additionally, the lack of large, publicly available datasets for training and evaluating LLMs in educational settings poses a significant obstacle, as does the need for models to be robust enough to handle varying levels of student proficiency and question difficulty.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research in automatic short answer grading (ASAG) has been limited by reliance on handcrafted approaches and the need for extensive technical expertise and large datasets. Many existing solutions have not adequately addressed the variability and complexity of open-ended responses, leading to inconsistent grading outcomes. Additionally, the emergence of LLMs is relatively recent, and their potential for educational assessment has not been fully explored. This paper's approach differs by introducing the AMMORE dataset, which provides a rich resource for training and evaluating LLMs specifically in the context of middle school math education, thus addressing the gap in available data.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nThe proposed methodology involves fine-tuning large language models on the AMMORE dataset, which consists of 53,000 student responses to middle school math questions. The evaluation will focus on metrics such as grading accuracy, consistency, and the ability to generalize across different question types and student responses.

Current formative assessment methods often lack timely feedback, which is crucial for student learning, particularly in K-12 education where engagement is vital. An adaptive assessment platform utilizing LLMs can transform feedback mechanisms by offering immediate, tailored responses that enhance student understanding and retention of concepts. This paper will pave the way for future research into automated feedback systems, facilitating a deeper exploration of personalized learning experiences. Additionally, the integration of ethical guidelines will ensure that this technology promotes equitable educational outcomes, addressing the disparities often seen in traditional assessment methods.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexities involved in solving this problem are significant. First, analyzing both written and spoken responses in real-time requires advanced natural language processing capabilities that can accurately interpret context, intent, and nuances in student responses. Traditional methods may fail due to their inability to accommodate the variability in student expression and engagement levels. Furthermore, adapting task complexity dynamically based on real-time analysis introduces challenges in ensuring that adjustments are both appropriate and scalable. There are also technical obstacles in maintaining the integrity and fairness of assessments, as biases in LLMs can lead to inequitable grading outcomes if not properly managed.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has made strides in automated feedback systems, particularly with the use of LLMs for grading, but significant gaps remain. Many existing solutions focus primarily on deterministic grading without considering the nuances of student engagement and the need for personalized feedback. Barriers such as the lack of comprehensive datasets that include both written and spoken responses, as well as the challenges in ensuring ethical standards in AI deployment, have hindered progress. My approach differs by integrating real-time analysis of student interaction patterns and implementing robust ethical guidelines to ensure fairness, thus addressing the limitations of prior work.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves developing a comprehensive adaptive assessment platform that utilizes a pre-trained LLM, such as GPT-4, to analyze student responses in both written and spoken formats. The platform will employ natural language understanding techniques to provide instant feedback and grading, with a focus on formative assessment practices in STEM education. A dataset comprising diverse student responses will be utilized to train and refine the model, ensuring accuracy and reliability in grading. Metrics for evaluation will include feedback timeliness, student engagement levels, and grading consistency compared to traditional assessment methods.

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas\nand reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that re-\nveal and support their progress (Harris et al. 2023). Forma-\ntive assessments play an important role in this endeavor, pro-\nviding timely feedback and guidance when students face dif-\nficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills\n(Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process\nof grading and generating personalized feedback from fre-\nquent formative assessments is time-consuming for teach-\ners and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014;\nHaudek et al. 2011).\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities\nfor automating short answer scoring (Funayama et al. 2023)\nand providing feedback to help students overcome their dif-\nficulties (Morris et al. 2023). These approaches can also aid\nteachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating\nactionable information to support student learning. To our\nknowledge, there is very little research that combines au-\ntomated formative assessment grading and feedback gener-\nation for science domains where understanding, reasoning,\nand explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of\nscientific phenomena (Mao et al. 2018).\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

We\npresent our approach, discuss our results also show that CoT and active learning can lead to\noverfitting, in particular, with simpler, easier-to-define sub-\nproblems. In these cases, LLM approaches may be overkill,\nas Moore et al. (2023) recently demonstrated. Rule-based Background\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning\nscience, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing\nknowledge (Wiley et al. 2020). This is particularly impor-\ntant for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environ-\nments that support students in their knowledge construction\nand problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023).\nIn these environments, knowledge and skill development\nhappen through system interactions that are difficult to mon-\nitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). For-\nmative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms\naligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and\nHastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students rec-\nognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) pro-\nvide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowl-\nedge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM\nideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative as-\nsessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where stu-\ndents\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary\nconsiderably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-\nconsuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incom-\nplete feedback (Liu et al. 2016). Moreover, grading these as-\nsessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather\nthan an aid to teachers. Very little research has examined ef-\nfective mechanisms for generating automated grading and\nuseful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned\nwith classroom learning goals.\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have pro-\nduced improved automated assessment scoring approaches\nto support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et al. 2023;\nWilson et al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data\naugmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next\nsentence prediction (Wu et al. 2023), prototypical neural\nnetworks (Zeng et al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Fu-\nnayama et al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sam-arXiv:2403.14565v1 ", " INTRODUCTION\nProviding meaningful feedback to learners is one of\nthe most important tasks of instructors [1]. yet it can\nalso become one of the most work-intensive or even te-\ndious tasks. Particularly for large-enrollment courses,\nlack of grading personnel can limit this feedback to\nautomatically gradable closed-answer formats such as\nmultiple-choice or numerical inputs. This limitation\nmight be overcome by using Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI)\nsolutions [2]; it is therefore not surprising that when it\ncomes to the use of AI in higher education, assessment\nand evaluation are the most prominent topics [3], and\nacceptance of this technology for education is increasing\nbased on its perceived usefulness [4]. In particular, stud-\nies on Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) [5, 6]\nare highly relevant for educators to extend the limits of\nwhat can be assessed at large scales.\nIt is impossible to do justice to the spectrum of so-\nphisticated ASAG methods in this short study; Burrows,\nGurevych, and Stein provide an excellent overview up\nto 2015 [5]; Haller, Aldea, Seifert, and Strisciuglio look\nat later developments up to 2022 [6]. The latter sur-\nvey notes a particular shift in recent years as models are\nmoving from hand-engineered features to representation-\nlearning approaches, which draw their initial training\ndata from large text corpora [6] (\u201cpre-trained\u201d). How-\never, most models used for ASAG still have in common\nthat they are explicitly trained or \ufb01ne-tuned for particu-\nlar grading tasks, and datasets used in competitions such\nas SemEval [7] thus include training and testing items.\nBy contrast, recently publicly released Large Language\nModels (LLMs) such as GPT-4 [8] and Bard [9] have not\nonly been pre-trained from large text corpora, but subse-\nquently extensively \ufb01ne-tuned following general instead\nof task-speci\ufb01c strategies.

SciEnts-\nBankcovers general science questions for 3rd to 6th\ngrade, while Beetle covers questions and student an-\nswersfrom a tutorialsystem forbasicelectricity and elec-\ntronics.\nThe standard judgment method is to compare the stu-\ndent answer to a reference answer, but in addition, it\nwas also investigated if GPT-4 can adequately grade the\nstudent answers based on the question alone. For the\nlatter task, the model would need to draw on its own\npre-training from its text corpus to independently judge\nthe correctness of the student answer.\nII.

However, artificial \nintelligence, including LLMs , is hard to understand  \n(Longo et al., 2023; Meske et al., 2022)  and suffers \nfrom security concerns  (Schneider & Apruzzese, \n2023) . Experts also perceive substantial risks \nassociated with LLMs and have advocated for a \ndevelopment moratorium on such technologies \n(Future of Life, 2023) . In academia, LLMs are used \nas a tool by researchers and students to such an extent \nthat researchers themselves have called on journals to \nclarify the allowable extent of AI -generated content \nin scholarly papers (Tang, 2023) , leading to the \npublication of guidelines for incorporating AI in the \npaper -writing process (Aczel & Wagenmakers, 2023) . \nEthical concerns have also been raised for education \n(Yan et al., 2023)  and children  (Schneider, Kruse, et \nal., 2024) . LLMs like ChatGPT have been commonly \ncompared against students in various disciplines \u2013 \nespecially with respect to their capability to pass \nexams. While some reports have indicated inferior \nperformance than a master\u2019s graduate in mathematics \n(Frieder et al., 2023) , other instances showcase a \nsuccessful completion of an introductory physics course (Kortemeyer, 2023) , as well as the passing of \nnumerous law school exams (Choi et al., 2023) . \nHowever, it is important to acknowledge the \nexistence of limitations in the LLMs. These models \ncan exhibit biases, discrimination , and factual \ninaccuracies  (Borji, 2023) . Consequently, there arises \ndoubt regarding their suitability  in education . In \nparticular, the necessity for human verification has \nbeen emphasized as a pressing research priority (van \nDis et al., 2023)  and the topic of human agency is also \ndebated on a regulatory level (EU, 2020) . Especially, \nhigh stakes decisions require careful analysis before \nAI can be utilized. Grading of exams is a high -stakes \nsituation, as errors in grading can cause students to \nfail an entire class, possibly causing a year -long delay \nin their education, separation of peers, etc. This, in \nturn, can lead to both financial and psychological \nstrain.  \nAs such it seems natural and even necessary to \nassess the suitability of LLM s for supporting exam \ngrading and to reflect upon adequate ways to include \nthem in the grading process while mitigating their \nrisks. To this end, we seek to contribute to two \nintertwined research questions:  (a) How can LLMs \nsupport educators in the grading process of exams?  \n(b) What are issues and concerns when using LLMs \nto support grading?  \nOur focus is on Automatic Short Answer Grading \n(ASAG), i.e., student replies are (short) textual answers (i.e., one or a few paragraphs). We use an \nLLM, i.e., ChatGPT to assess the instructor\u2019s answer, \na student\u2019s answer in general as well as a student\u2019s \nanswer with respect to the instructor\u2019s answer as \nillustrated in Figure 1. In our experimental eva luation, \nwe use d two exams from two educators. ", " Introduction\nOpen-ended questions \u2014 questions that require\nstudents to produce multi-word, nontrivial responses\n\u2014 are a popular assessment tool in educational en-\nvironments because they offer students the chance to\nexplore their understanding of learning material. Such\nquestions provide valuable insight into students\u2019 grasp\nof complex concepts and their problem-solving ap-\nproaches. However, grading open-ended questions can\nbe time-consuming, subjective, and \u2014 especially in thecase of large class sizes \u2014 prone to attentional errors.\nThese factors create a critical bottleneck in precision\neducation.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) present an op-\nportunity to automate and promote equity in learning\nassessments, providing rapid valuable feedback to stu-\ndents while reducing the burden on instructors. We\ndeveloped a tool that automatically assesses students\u2019\nresponses to open-ended questions by evaluating their\nresponses against a set of instructor-defined criteria.\nTo use our tool, the instructor poses a question along\nwith optional grading criteria. Students respond to\nthese questions, and their answers are relayed to a\nserver. The responses are paired with the grading cri-\nteria (which are not revealed to the student), forming\na payload for a large language model (LLM). The LLM\nthen generates automated feedback, suggesting areas\nfor improvement to the student.\nHere, we describe the technical design of our tool,\nFreeText, and showcase its utility in educational envi-\nronments spanning topics and complexity. We further\noutline the implications of our work for teaching com-\nplex subjects, and the potential role of large language\nmodelsineducation( Fig.1).

Early automated grading\ntools focused on \u2018solvable\u2019 tasks like math or program-\nming assignments, where grading generally relies on\nunit tests or direct output comparisons (Hollingsworth,\n1960; Ureel II and Wallace, 2019; Orr and Russell,\n2021; Messer et al., 2023). These approaches often\noverlook less easily-quantified but nonetheless critical\nindicatorsoflearningandunderstanding, suchasdesign\nquality, code maintainability, or potential areas of stu-\ndent confusion. Modern tools, like AutoGrader, which\nprovides real-time grading for programming exercises,\nremain narrowly focused on output correctness and do\nnotsufficientlyaccountfordocumentationormaintain-\nability (Liu et al., 2019).\nAssessing students\u2019 understanding from natural\nlanguage responses, however, presents different chal-\nlenges and has seen significant evolution. Early Au-\ntomated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) models em-\nployed statistical or domain-specific neural network ap-\nproaches (Heilman and Madnani, 2013; Riordan et al.,\n2017; Sung et al., 2019). In recent years, LLMs have\nbeen shown to outperform domain-specific language\nmodels (Radford et al., 2019; Mizumoto et al., 2019;\nBrown et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2022). LLMs fa-\ncilitate grading of open-ended assignment responses,\nwithout the need for task-specific fine-tuning (Cao,\n2023;MizumotoandEguchi,2023;Yoon,2023). How-\never, Kortemeyer (2023) revealed that while LLMs\nlike GPT-4 could be useful for preliminary grading of\nintroductory physics assignments, they fell short for\nnatural-language responses required in comprehensive\nexam grading.", " Introduction\nMany NLP applications require high-quality labeled data, notably to train classi\ufb01ers or evaluate\nthe performance of unsupervised models. For example, researchers often aim to \ufb01lter noisy social\nmedia data for relevance, assign texts to different topics or conceptual categories, or measure\ntheir sentiment or stance. Regardless of the speci\ufb01c approach used for these tasks (supervised,\nsemi-supervised, or unsupervised), labeled data are needed to build a training set or a gold standard\nagainst which performance can be assessed. Such data may be available for high-level tasks\nsuch as semantic evaluation (Emerson et al., 2022). More typically, however, researchers have to\nconduct original annotations to ensure that the labels match their conceptual categories (Benoit\net al., 2016). Until recently, two main strategies were available. First, researchers can recruit and\ntrain coders, such as research assistants. Second, they can rely on crowd-workers on platforms\n\u0003Corresponding author (https://fabriziogilardi.org/).arXiv:2303.15056v2  [cs.CL]  19 Jul 2023ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for text-annotation tasks\nsuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Often, these two strategies are used in combination:\ntrained annotators create a relatively small gold-standard dataset, and crowd-workers are employed\nto increase the volume of labeled data. Trained annotators tend to produce high-quality data,\nbut involve signi\ufb01cant costs. Crowd workers are a much cheaper and more \ufb02exible option, but\nthe quality may be insuf\ufb01cient, particularly for complex tasks and languages other than English.\nMoreover, there have been concerns that MTurk data quality has decreased (Chmielewski and\nKucker, 2020), while alternative platforms such as CrowdFlower and FigureEight are no longer\npracticable options for academic research since they were acquired by Appen, a company that is\nfocused on a business market.\nThis paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for text annotation tasks, with a\nfocus on ChatGPT, which was released in November 2022. It demonstrates that zero-shot ChatGPT\nclassi\ufb01cations (that is, without any additional training) outperform MTurk annotations, at a fraction\nof the cost. LLMs have been shown to perform very well for a wide range of purposes, including\nideological scaling (Wu et al., 2023), the classi\ufb01cation of legislative proposals (Nay, 2023), the\nresolution of cognitive psychology tasks (Binz and Schulz, 2023), and the simulation of human\nsamples for survey research (Argyle et al., 2023). While a few studies suggested that ChatGPT\nmight perform text annotation tasks of the kinds we have described (Kuzman, Mozeti \u02c7c and Ljube\u0161i \u00b4c,\n2023; Huang, Kwak and An, 2023), to the best of our knowledge our work is the \ufb01rst systematic\nevaluation. Our analysis relies on a sample of 6,183 documents, including tweets and news articles\nthat we collected for a previous study (Alizadeh et al., 2022) as well as a new sample of tweets\nposted in 2023. In our previous study, the texts were labeled by trained annotators (research\nassistants) for \ufb01ve different tasks: relevance, stance, topics, and two kinds of frame detection.\nUsing the same codebooks that we developed to instruct our research assistants, we submitted the\ntasks to ChatGPT as zero-shot classi\ufb01cations, as well as to crowd-workers on MTurk. We then\nevaluated the performance of ChatGPT against two benchmarks: (i) its accuracy, relative to that\nof crowd-workers, and (ii) its intercoder agreement, relative to that of crowd workers as well as\nof our trained annotators. We \ufb01nd that across the four datasets, ChatGPT\u2019s zero-shot accuracy is\nhigher than", " Introduction\nChatGPT has shown strong capabilities as a dia-\nlogue system, providing clearer and more helpful\nanswers than humans (Guo et al., 2023). It re-\nmains unclear whether its performance on text cat-\negorization tasks, more speci\ufb01cally on automatic\ngenre identi\ufb01cation, can be compared to the ex-\nisting large language models (LLMs), such as the\nXLM-RoBERTa model (Conneau et al., 2020), \ufb01ne-\ntuned to the task. Despite the fact that the ChatGPT\nmodel was made available to the public only a few\nmonths ago, some studies, analyzing the poten-\ntial of the model for numerous natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks, have already been pub-\nlished. Qin et al.

The success of large language\nmodels (LLMs) is often attributed to (in-context) few-shot or zero-shot learning. It can solve various\ntasks by simply conditioning the models on a few examples (few-shot) or instructions describing the\ntask (zero-shot). The method of conditioning the language model is called \u201cprompting\u201d [Liu et al.,\n2021b], and designing prompts either manually [Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2021, Reynolds and McDonell,\n2021] or automatically [Gao et al., 2021, Shin et al., 2020] has become a hot topic in NLP.\n\u0003Work done while at The University of Tokyo.\n36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2205.11916v4  [cs.CL]  29 Jan 2023(c) Zero-shot \nQ: A juggler can juggle 16 balls.

AS approaches have the po-\ntential to signi\fcantly reduce the amount of human grading e\u000bort and scale well\nto an ever-increasing student population. AS has been studied in many di\u000berent\ncontexts, especially essays, known as automated essay scoring (AES) [1,18], but\nalso in other contexts such as automatic short answer grading (ASAG) [23,31]\nfor domains including humanities, social sciences [21], and math [3].\nExisting approaches for AS include feature engineering, i.e., developing fea-\ntures that summarize the length, syntax [4,9,18], cohesion [11], relevance to\nthe item [19], and semantics [25] of student responses combined with machine\nlearning-based classi\fers [2,16] to predict the score. These approaches have excel-\nlent interpretability but require human expertise in feature development. RecentarXiv:2205.09864v2  [cs.LG]  15 Jun 20232 N. Fernandez et al.\napproaches leverage advances in deep learning to produce better textual repre-\nsentations of student responses, alleviating the need to rely on human-engineered\nfeatures. Examples include combining neural networks with human-engineered\nfeatures for score prediction [24] and especially approaches that \fne-tune neural\nlanguage models (LMs) such as BERT [8] and GPT-2 [20] on the downstream\nAS task [14,15,22,28]. Despite concerns on the vulnerability against gaming in-\nput [14] and fairness aspects [13] of these approaches, they have performed well\nin terms of scoring accuracy on publicly available benchmark datasets such as\nthe automated student assessment prize (ASAP) for essay scoring [1].\nHowever, existing AS approaches are limited in many ways, including a sig-\nni\fcant one we address in this paper: They almost always train a separate AS\nmodel for each item. This approach is acceptable in contexts such as AES since\nthe items (essay prompts) are likely not highly related to each other. However,\nin other contexts such as reading comprehension, multiple items may share the\nsame background information. More importantly, this approach results in more fair models [29]. When using\ndemographic information as input, we prepend the input with textual instruc-\ntions such as \\score this answer written by a Female Asian student\", according\nto the demographics of the student. Figure 2 shows the prediction biases for a\nshared item in both grades 4 and 8. We see that our approach tends to overesti-\nmate the score, except for Paci\fc Islanders/American Indians on grade 4, which\nis possibly due to the small number of such students in the training data. In10 N. Fernandez et al.\ngeneral, the biases are within an acceptable range (the same experiments on the training dataset provided by\nthe NAEP AS challenge. We conduct both quantitative evaluations on scoring\naccuracy of our approach and qualitative evaluations on the error types and\nfairness aspects of our approach.\n3.1 Dataset Details\nEach item in the NAEP AS Challenge has responses from either one of two\nformats: short (around one sentence) or extended (up to around \fve sentences)\nresponses, leading to di\u000berent score classes. The minimum score for all items is 1,\nwith the maximum being either 2 or 3 for short responses and 3 or 4 for extended\nresponses.

Fernandez et al.\nresponses per item.", " Introduction\nOver the last few years, very large neural networks trained for language understanding and generation have\nachieved astonishing Related Work\nNatural language capabilities have signi\fcantly advanced through large scale language modeling over the\nlast several years. Broadly, language modeling refers to approaches for predicting either the next token in\na sequence or for predicting masked spans (Devlin et al., 2019; Ra\u000bel et al., 2020). These self-supervised\nobjectives when applied to vast corpora including data scraped from the internet, books, and forums, have\nresulted in models with advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Predictable power-laws\nof model quality through scaling the amount of data, parameters, and computation have made this a reliable\napproach for increasingly more capable models (Kaplan et al., 2020).\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) unleashed unparalleled e\u000eciency on modern accelerators\nand has become the de-facto approach for language models. In the span of only four years, the largest\nmodels have increased in size and total computation by several orders of magnitude. One of the \frst major\nsuccesses of scale was the 345M parameter encoder-only BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019) which signi\fcantly\nadvanced language understanding across classi\fcation tasks, including SuperGLUE. The Generative Pre-\ntrained Transformer (GPT) series, decoder-only models, (Radford et al., 2018; Ra\u000bel et al., 2020) set\nstate-of-the-art language modeling performance. Ra\u000bel et al. (2020) then pre-trained and \fne-tuned up to 11B\nparameter encoder-decoder models, setting a new bar in transfer learning. The most recent model in the GPT\nseries, the 175B parameter GPT-3 model (Brown et al., 2020) uncovered new capabilities from inference-only,\nfew-shot techniques. Scale has continued to increase after GPT-3, evidenced by the succession of the 178B\nparameter Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), the 280B parameter Gopher model (Rae et al., 2021), the 530B\nMegatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) as well as trillion parameter sparse models including Switch\nTransformers (Fedus et al., 2021) and GLaM (Du et al., 2021). These advances in core natural language\ncapabilities have also been accompanied with improvements in other domains, including understanding and\ngenerating code (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). Additionally, dialogue applications have advanced\nthrough scale, as most recently evidenced by LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), a 137B decoder-only model.\nFinally, additional work has enabled language models to follow instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022a) { improving the usefulness and reliability of these models.\nThese larger models no longer can be e\u000eciently trained or even \ft into the memory of a single accelerator.\nTherefore, techniques have arisen for splitting model tensors across accelerators (Shazeer et al., 2018) or\nalternatively separating layers of the models across accelerators and then pipe-lining activations between\nthe stages (Huang et al., 2019). Many other works aim to increase of the scale of models, while limiting\ncommunication overheads (Rajbhandari et al., 2020; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Rasley et al.,\n2020; Rajbhandari et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Narayanan et al., 2021a). PaLM uses a blend of data and\nmodel-parallelism enabled through the Pathways infrastructure (Barham et al., 2022).\nArchitectural variants have been proposed to help scale models more e\u000eciently. One area is retrieval models\nthat aim to drastically reduce model sizes by embedding large amounts of text the model can have access to\nlater (Guu et al.,", " INTRODUCTION\nIn the education field, large attention is dedicated to characterizing the learning process of students\nto determine the efficiency and success of learners in acquiring new knowledge. Assessing and\nquantifying the knowledge gain are fundamental aspects for evaluating the quality of the learning\nprocess. Due to the time-consuming and individual nature of the assessment process, it is crucial to\nrender it as efficient as possible, e.g. by using some level of grading automation, while retaining or\neven improving its quality [44].\nBesides formative assessment (e.g. teacher feedback of assignments), the main method of assess-\nment is via summative assessment (e.g. written examinations) [ 69], where knowledge acquired by\nthe students can be tested in several ways. Different types of questions can be formulated: closed-\nform questions (e.g. multiple-choice) or open answer questions (e.g. essays or short answers) [ 2].\nAutomated grading for multiple-choice questions is straightforward and immediate. Automated\nEssay Scoring (AES) and Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) are more challenging tasks\nbecause the assessment of these answers requires an understanding of the text and a more detailed\nanalysis [ 39,69]. The main difference between AES and ASAG is that the latter deals with short\nanswers usually graded against a reference answer, whereas the former is concerned with scoring\nlonger textual answers and the grading is based on evaluating the quality in terms of spelling,\ngrammar and coherence, and less on compact information content [39].\nThe assessment of textual open answers is challenging and requires techniques and approaches\nfrom different fields, such as natural language processing (NLP), text understanding, and reading\nAuthors\u2019 addresses: Stefan Haller, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, s.m.haller@student.utwente.nl; Adina\nAldea, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, a.aldea@utwente.nl; Christin Seifert, University of Twente,\nEnschede, The Netherlands and - University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany, christin.seifert@uni-due.de; Nicola\nStrisciuglio, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, n.strisciuglio@utwente.nl.\n, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", " Introduction\nLarge-scale language model pretraining has become increasingly prevalent for achieving high per-\nformance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. When applying these models\nto a speci\ufb01c task, they are usually \ufb01ne-tuned using supervised learning, often to maximize the log\nprobability of a set of human demonstrations.\nWhile this strategy has led to markedly improved performance, there is still a misalignment between\nthis \ufb01ne-tuning objective\u2014maximizing the likelihood of human-written text\u2014and what we care\nabout\u2014generating high-quality outputs as determined by humans.

Controlling for length reduces the relative preference of our human feedback models, however\nthey are still preferred to the reference summaries. (b) Plotting model quality for different summary\nlengths on the TL;DR dataset. Our 6.7B human feedback model outperforms both the 6.7B supervised\nbaseline and the reference summaries (horizontal line at 0.5) across lengths.\nF Controlling for summary length\nAs discussed in Section 4.1, the length of a summary is a confounding factor for evaluating summary\nquality; depending on the desired trade-off between conciseness and coverage, a shorter or longer\nsummary might be better. Our models generate summaries that are longer than the reference\nsummaries, as this led to higher labeler preference given the 24-48 token limit for our task. Here we\ndescribe the procedure we use to attempt to control for length.\nTo calculate a single length-controlled preference number, we train a logistic regression model to\npredict the human-preferred summary on our dataset of human comparisons. We provide this model\nwith 2 features: the identity of each policy, and the log ratio of the summary lengths. To calculate\nthe length-controlled preference value between two policies, we simply give each policy ID to our\ntrained logistic regression model and set the log length ratio to zero (see Figure 10a). In Figure 10b\nwe examine summary quality across a range of summary lengths on TL;DR. We \ufb01nd that our human\nfeedback model outperforms the supervised baseline across all length values.\nFor CNN/DM, we use a similar procedure as described above to control for length, except using a\nlinear regression model to predict the Likert rating from 1-7. We show the expected quality increase\nfor making summaries 100 characters longer in Table 14, which suggests our human feedback models\nwould perform better", " Introduction\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\n\ufb02exible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),"], "bleu": 0.0, "rouge_l": 0.28354978354978355, "gpt_metric_score": 0.5, "bert_score": 0.33610671758651733}

Additionally, there are technical obstacles related to the design of the ranking pipeline, such as the selection of appropriate examples from the training set, the construction of effective task definitions, and the management of the non-parametric memory to ensure that the LLM can generalize well to unseen queries.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on parametric training methods that require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their applicability. Existing solutions often overlook the potential of non-parametric approaches that utilize a training set for context. Barriers such as the lack of understanding of LLMs' emergent capabilities and the complexity of designing effective ranking pipelines have prevented this problem from being addressed. Our approach differs by proposing a straightforward method that leverages LLMs' capabilities without extensive fine-tuning, thus filling a significant gap in the current research landscape.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves using a pairwise ranking approach that incorporates LLM-based inference with few-shot examples from a training set of query-document pairs. We will evaluate our method using standard retrieval metrics such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) on benchmark datasets. The expected outcomes include improved ranking performance compared to existing zero-shot methods and a demonstration of the effectiveness of non-parametric memory in enhancing LLM capabilities for document retrieval tasks", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nHow can we develop a hybrid retrieval framework that effectively integrates few-shot learning with large language models to enhance the interpretation of medical fMRI data and user intention modeling, particularly in generating context-aware diagnostic queries that adaptively refine treatment recommendations based on real-time brain activity analysis and user behavior patterns?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem is critical for advancing the field of medical diagnostics and neurotechnology. By enhancing the interpretation of medical fMRI data, we can provide more accurate and personalized treatment recommendations, which can significantly improve patient outcomes. This research has broader implications for the development of brain-computer interfaces and cognitive neuroscience, as it will contribute to a deeper understanding of brain activity and user interactions. Moreover, the integration of ethical AI principles will ensure that the framework promotes fair outcomes across diverse demographic groups, which is essential in clinical settings. Addressing this question will not only advance knowledge in the areas of fMRI analysis and user intention modeling but will also lead to practical applications in real-time diagnostics, personalized medicine, and equitable healthcare.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexity of this problem arises from several challenges. First, fMRI data is inherently high-dimensional and variable due to individual differences in brain anatomy and function, making it difficult to create a universal framework applicable across diverse populations. Naive approaches that rely solely on traditional machine learning techniques often fail to capture the nuanced relationships between brain activity and user intentions. Additionally, incorporating few-shot learning effectively requires sophisticated algorithms that can generalize from limited data without overfitting. There are also technical hurdles related to ensuring the robustness of the framework against adversarial attacks, such as prompt injection, which can compromise the reliability of the system. Finally, achieving bias-aware performance necessitates a thorough understanding of demographic disparities and the implementation of strategies to mitigate them.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either fMRI data analysis or user behavior modeling in isolation, resulting in a lack of integrated frameworks that address both areas simultaneously. Existing solutions often fall short in adaptability and robustness, as seen in approaches like fMRI-PTE and DreamCatcher, which, while innovative, do not fully account for the dynamic interplay between brain activity and user intentions. Barriers such as limited understanding of few-shot learning applications in medical contexts and inadequate consideration of ethical AI principles have also hindered progress. Our approach differs by combining these elements into a cohesive framework that leverages the strengths of few-shot learning and large language models while explicitly addressing adversarial robustness and bias mitigation.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid retrieval framework that integrates few-shot learning with large language models. We will utilize a diverse dataset of fMRI scans and corresponding user behavior patterns to train our model. The framework will employ context-aware diagnostic queries generated through a combination of adversarial training techniques and ethical AI principles to ensure bias-aware performance. We will evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy in treatment recommendations, robustness against adversarial prompts, and fairness across demographic groups. Expected outcomes include improved interpretation of fMRI data, enhanced user experience through personalized recommendations, and the establishment of a reliable and equitable framework for clinical applications.

These\nlanguage models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to\ncapture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent\nmanner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked\nlanguage model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from\nthe text [ 17,45,64], or an auto-regressive model or causal language\nmodel (CLM) which predicts a token only from its predecessor\ntokens [ 5,63,82]. While MLM is employed in BERT [ 17] and its\nsuccessors, such as RoBERTa [ 45], BART [ 39] etc., the latter class\nof models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants [ 5,58,63] and\nopen-source Llama and Mistral variants [ 35,79] etc. LLMs, when\nscaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated\nto be adaptable to a broad set of tasks due to instruction tuning [ 59],\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically\ncorrect and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves\nsurprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs,\ncommonly called prompts [3].\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small\nnumber of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised\nlearning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT\n[17]) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018fine-tuning\u2019)\nfrom a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot learn-\ning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled exam-\nples from a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction\nto control the text generation in a desirable way beneficial to the\ndownstream task [ 41,53,54,61]. In addition to leveraging ICL for\na purely generative task, e.g., question answering or abstractive\nsummarisation [ 5,42,78], a more common use is in a predictive\ntask, such as text classification [ 46,52], where each class is spec-\nified by a set of words (commonly called a verbaliser [ 69]), e.g.,\nfor a binary sentiment classification task the positive class could\nbe defined by the set {\u2018good\u2019, \u2018great\u2019, \u2018wonderful\u2019... }. Once each\nclass for a predictive task is well-defined, the generated text can be\nmapped to the most likely class(es) by using the posterior over the\nvocabulary generated by the decoder.\nIt is to be realised that ICL is somewhat conceptually similar to\na non-parametric approach, such as \ud835\udc58-NN, where the predictionarXiv:2405.01116v1  [cs.IR]  2 May 2024SIGIR \u201924, July 14\u201318, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Parry, Ganguly, and Chandra\nRetr ie v al \nModel\nA daptiv e ICL with 3 IR V er ticalsT op -k\nE x amples\nQP P\nQuestion Ans w er ingT e xt ClassificationNeur al\nR ankingF acet ed\nIRA dapt\nE x amplesRe -R ank\nE x amplesDiv er sif y\nE x amples\nLLMStandar d ICL\nDo wnstr e am T ask sInput Instanc eLabeled Data\nInde x\nFigure 1: A workflow diagram illustrating how three verticals\nof IR research fit into the workflow of in-context learning\n(ICL).

Such\nmodels recompute term weights for documents and\nqueries to improve effectiveness, going as far as learn-\ning how to expand texts to be even more effective in\nIR tasks. LSR underpinning hypothesis is that exist-\ning search infrastructure, namely the inverted index\nand its efficient algorithms can easily be used to serve\nsuch models [ 30]. However, a mismatch exists between\nthe posting lists score distribution of LSR models and\ntraditional models like BM25, leading to inefficiency\nissues [18]. One could argue that first-stage retrieval\nfor bag-of-word models has been heavily optimized\nfor years leading to better algorithms such as MaxS-\ncore [31], WAND [ 2], and Block-Max WAND [ 9]; and\nthat LSR models would need better optimisations when\nused with a traditional inverted index. Therefore, re-\ncent works based on Guided Traversal (GT) [ 21,24]\nhaveadaptedexistingalgorithmstoimprovethelatency\nof LSR models, where the main goal is to reuse BM25\nto guide the selection of scored documents during the\nretrieval phase.\nIn this work, we address the same research question:given the mismatch between LSR models and tradi-\ntional search algorithms, how can we better use the\nexisting search algorithms and how can we improve the\nlatency of LSR models. While several learned sparse\nretrieval works have been proposed, we focus this work\nonSPLADE[ 10], duetoitspopularityandeffectiveness.\nOur goal is to increase the flexibility of the end user\n(directly be able to modulate efficiency/effectiveness\nat retrieval time), while limiting the amount of change\nneeded on the overall system for the provider of the\nsearch engine.\nFollowing recent works, where LSR is used as first stage\nretriever in a multi-stage ranking pipeline [ 20], the\nmain goal of this work is to further split the first stage\nretrieval in two parts. More precisely, our method relies\non the observation that SPLADE sparse vectors can be\napproximatedbysparservectorsobtainedwithtoppool-\ning. Moreover, based on the discussion in [ 12] about\nsaturation function and dynamic pruning, we add a\nterm re-weighting to the SPLADE scoring function that\nimproves the efficiency of dynamic pruning for SPLADE\nvectors via a trade-off with effectiveness1. In other\nwords, a very good approximation of a sparse vector is\na sparser re-weighted version of this vector. Therefore,\nwe can first compute the approximated results (same\neffectiveness in 17 out of 30 instead of 18), although\nwith higher latencies due to the different statistics of\nthe models. We omit these tables due to lack of space.\nFinally, looking into raw values we can be tempted to\ncompare with raw numbers from other papers, such\nas [23,24]. These papers report a MSMARCO latency\nof 22 and 6.9ms for retrieving the top 10documents,\nwhile we report 2.4 ms with our method to retrieve the\ntop100documents.

This development has been par-\nticularly influential in the realm of text ranking.\nNotably, there has been a surge in initiatives fo-\ncused on zero-shot listwise reranking using LLMs,\nreferred to as \u201cprompt-decoders\u201d, as evidenced by\nworks such as RankGPT (Sun et al., 2023) and\nLRL (Ma et al., 2023b). However, a common limi-\ntation in these endeavors is their reliance on propri-\netary models. While these models facilitate rapid\nprototyping and are conveniently accessible viaAPI endpoints, they pose challenges in terms of\nscientific reproducibility. This issue is critical both\nfrom the standpoint of adhering to the principles\nof robust scientific methodology and practically in\nthe context of achieving consistent, reliable mea-\nsurements in experimental evaluations.\nRecently, RankVicuna (Pradeep et al., 2023b)\nhelped address this pressing need within the aca-\ndemic community for an open-source LLM that\ncan proficiently execute reranking tasks, improv-\ning over the much larger proprietary model Rank-\nGPT 3.5. However, RankVicuna still lags behind the\nstate-of-the-art RankGPT 4in effectiveness. Bridg-\ning this gap and striving beyond with an open-\nsource model would be of great value to the NLP\nand IR communities working towards RAG archi-\ntectures that require high-precision experiments demonstrate\nthat RankZephyr matches and occasionally sur-\npasses the effectiveness of much larger proprietary\nmodels such as RankGPT 4. The significance of our\nwork lies not just in reranking effectiveness, but\nalso in reproducibility and accessibility, setting a\nnew standard for the community.\nOur work delves into multiple facets of reranking\nwith prompt-decoder models. We show that pro-\ngressive reranking generally yields higher-quality\noutput in being able to promote more relevant doc-\numents. We also show how the choice of the first-\nstage retrieval model impacts downstream rerank-\ning effectiveness in RankZephyr and other list-\nwise methods. We explored settings in the teacher\nmodel, candidate source, and sampling strategies\nthat lead to the most efficient and effective instruc-\ntion fine-tuning. Our findings also highlight the\ncrucial role of data augmentation in enhancing ro-\nbustness. Finally, the effectiveness of RankZephyr\non the NovelEval test set, comprising \u201cuncontam-\ninated\u201d queries and passages, addresses potential\nconcerns about memorization and potential for real-\nworld applications.\nWe believe that RankZephyr represents a note-\nworthy milestone as the community continues to\ndevelop and refine large language models for infor-\nmation retrieval. Our work paves the way for future\nexploration in more effective and robust reranking\nmodels, both as an independent component and as\npart of a larger RAG pipeline. Background and Related Work\nThe core task governing information retrieval is:\ngiven a document corpus C={D1, D2, . . . , D n}\nand a query q, return a ranked list of khighly rel-\nevant documents from C, where k\u226a |C| . The\nnotion of relevance is determined by metrics such\nas nDCG or average precision. Subsequently, the\nrole of a reranker is to enhance the quality of thisranked list, either using the same or different met-\nrics, typically by refining the selection made by the\nretriever or a preceding reranker.\nBoth retrievers and rerankers are integral com-\nponents of multi-stage pipelines for text ranking.\nWhile recent studies have focused on transform-\ners (Nogueira et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2021), the\ngeneral design traces back over a decade (Matveeva\net al., 2006; Cambazoglu et al., 2010; Wang\net al., 2011).

Nevertheless, in-domain demonstrations\nare usually absent in real scenarios since the target\ndomain labels are unavailable. Sourcing labeled ex-\namples from other domains may suffer from huge\nsyntactic and semantic domain shifts.

Therefore, the limitations above call for\neffective adaptation strategies to transfer knowl-\nedge of LMs from a labeled source domain to an\nunlabeled target domain, known as Unsupervised\nDomain Adaptation (UDA).\nTo bridge the domain gap, UDA aims to adapt\nmodels that learn domain-agnostic features from\nlabeled source samples and unlabeled target sam-\nples. Some studies have proposed discrepancy mea-\nsures to align source and target distributions in the\nrepresentation space (Ganin et al., 2016; Ye et al.,\n2020; Long et al., 2022). However, these methods to train a dense retriever. On\nthe other hand, it is hard to tell what makes a good\ndemonstration simply based on a retrieval system,\nconsidering that the retrieval system does not have\naccess to the inference task. We leave this for fu-\nture work to explore what is a good demonstrative\nexample when encountering domain shift.\n8 Ethics Statement\nTo ensure the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence\nin the legal field, we have taken measures such as\nanonymizing sensitive information in real-world\ndatasets.

Retrieval also plays an important role in en-\nhancing the effectiveness of large language models\n(LLMs) in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\npipeline (Lewis et al., 2020b; Shi et al., 2023). This\napproach not only mitigates hallucinations but also\nenables LLMs to access knowledge that is not cap-\ntured within their parameters (Yang et al., 2023;\nJiang et al., 2023).\n1https://huggingface.co/castoriniA typical multi-stage text retrieval pipeline con-\nsists of a retriever , designed to efficiently locate the\ntop-krelevant texts from a corpus, and a reranker ,\nwhich further refines the order of the retrieved can-\ndidates to improve output quality (Nogueira and\nCho, 2019). Both retrievers and rerankers have sig-\nnificantly benefited from the advent of pre-trained\nlanguage models based on Transformers (Vaswani\net al., 2017) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020). These models are trained\nto encode queries and documents into vector repre-\nsentations for retrieval (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lin,\n2021) or to directly score the relevance between\na query and a document for reranking (Nogueira\net al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2023).\nRecent large language models with billions of pa-\nrameters, fine-tuned to follow instructions, such as\nInstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), GPT-4 (Open-\nAI, 2023), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b),\nhave exhibited extraordinary capabilities in many\nNLP tasks, surpassing previous smaller pre-trained\nlanguage models (Zhao et al., 2023). For retrieval,\nrecent methods that prompt\nlarge language models for text reranking in a gener-\native manner. This work underscores the potential\nof leveraging LLMs for retrieval tasks in the future,\nwhich we continue to explore. experiments (Sec-\ntion 3) use LoRA instead of full fine-tuning.\n4.2 Input Sequence Length\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, RankLLaMA has\nthe advantage of accommodating longer inputs\ncompared to previous models like BERT since its\nLLaMA backbone was pre-trained with a longer\ncontext window. We investigate the effects of vary-\ning the maximum training input length and infer-\nence input length on model effectiveness for the\ndocument reranking task. results in a 49G (flat) index after pre-encoding the\nentire corpus.

Moreover, the model\ntrained with a length of 4096 takes about 8", " Introduction\nIn-context learning (ICL) using large language\nmodels (LLMs) has recently exploded in popularity.\nModels pre-trained on massive amounts of textual\ndata are able to reach reasonable performance on\na wide variety of tasks with only a few examples\nof input and output for a given task provided in the\nmodel\u2019s input prompt in natural language (Brown\net al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al.,\n2023). In this work, we study whether ICL can\nhandle challenging classification tasks with many\npossible labels, by augmenting the LM with a sec-\nondary pre-trained retrieval model.\nThe main problem with applying ICL to tasks\ninvolving classification with many labels is the lim-ited context window these models have. Ordinarily\nwith ICL, at minimum one example from each class\nis provided in-context to allow the model to make\na choice between all the labels of the task. Be-\ncause of this limitation, ICL has not been directly\napplied to these sorts of problems. In this work\nwe relax this requirement, allowing the model to\nsee only a subset of the most relevant labels for\nthe given datapoint we are performing inference\non. By testing on intent classification (upwards\nof 50 classes) and fine-grained sentiment analy-\nsis (upwards of 25 classes), we demonstrate that\nthe resulting performance with this method can\nreach SoTA. By coupling the LLM with an exter-\nnal pre-trained dense retriever model (Reimers and\nGurevych, 2019a; Karpukhin et al., 2020), we can\ndynamically retrieve a set of examples to provide\nto the LM in-context, that reflects only the most\nrelevant labels to the current example in the label\nspace. Most existing work on augmenting LMs\nwith retrieval models (Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al.,\n2023) focuses on tuning the retrieval and/or LM.\nWe demonstrate that even without tuning either,\nwhen the pre-trained models are strong enough we\ncan still achieve SoTA across various tasks using\nICL.\nWe evaluate LLMs in this setting with\nthree intent classification datasets: BANKING77\n(Casanueva et al., 2020), HWU64 (Liu et al.,\n2019), and CLINC150 (Larson et al., 2019), as\nwell as one fine-grained sentiment classification\ndataset: GoEmotions (Demszky et al., 2020).

These models\nperform downstream tasks primarily via prompting:\nall relevant task specification and data to process is\nformatted as a textual input context, and the model\nreturns a generated text completion.

The \ufb01nal answer can\nbe obtained after the execution of the \ufb01nal candidates.\ntopics, it poses a great challenge for suppliers\nwith limited resources, who rely on the models\ntrained on certain knowledge bases or benchmarks.\nConcretely, the dif\ufb01culties primarily lie in the\nfollowing aspects: 1) Data intensiveness: larger\nknowledge bases require ever larger quantities\nof annotated data to allow \ufb01ne-tuned models\nto generalize well over them. (Yih et al., 2016;\nTalmor and Berant, 2018; Gu et al., 2020). 2)\nDataset speci\ufb01city: For relatively small-scale\nKBQA datasets, the fully-trained models tend\nto over\ufb01t to a speci\ufb01c schema, and can hardly\ngeneralize to knowledge base questions in unseen\ndomains (Su et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Sun\net al., 2019). These challenges make it crucial to\ndevise a new framework that can work in both\nlow-resource and training-free settings in KBQA.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) like\nGPT-3 and Codex (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al.,arXiv:2305.01750v2  [cs.CL]  4 May 20232021a) have demonstrated their strong generaliz-\nability (Wang et al., 2022a; Wei et al., 2022b; Zhou\net al., 2022b; Cheng et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022a;\nSuzgun et al., 2022) on a wide range of text, table,\ncommonsense and even math QA tasks with few-\nshot in-context learning. Other works also validate\nthat Codex (Chen et al., 2021a) can parse and trans-\nform unstructured instructions to structured and\nexecutable code with only a few dozen demonstra-\ntions (Gao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). These\nworks inspire us to tackle KBQA with LLMs, an\nunder-explored area in the literature that is par-\nticularly challenging compared to other QA tasks\nbecause of the massive scale of modern KBs.\nHowever, it is still unclear how to address\nKBQA with in-context learning. Unlike many other\nquestion-answering tasks, where the evidence is\nprovided with a reasonable length limit, KBQA\nneeds to condition on a massive graph containing\nmillions of nodes and billions of edges. Evidently,\nit is impossible to feed the whole graph as-is to\nthe language model. Even feeding a subgraph is\nextremely challenging as it requires splitting the\nmonolithic graph into self-consistent and query-\nrelevant chunks, which is itself an unaddressed\nresearch problem. Without feeding the knowledge\ngraph as an additional input, language models be-\ncome unaware of the schema of the KB.

Learning a text ranking\nmodel is a fundamental component of countless\nreal world applications such as search and ques-\ntion answering. Earliest explorations (Liu, 2009)\nmostly rely on handcrafted numerical features to\nrepresent each query-document pair (Qin and Liu,\n2013; Chapelle and Chang, 2011) and put more em-\nphasis on the learning algorithms such as ranking\nlosses (Qin et al., 2021). Progress on pretrained lan-\nguage models in the past few years (Devlin et al.,\n2019) and the release of large-scale public data\nsets (Bajaj et al., 2016; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019)\nenable a series of work (Lin et al., 2020; Nogueira\net al., 2019; Han et al., 2020) on text ranking mod-\nels which directly encode textual query and docu-ment using pretrained language models, noticeably\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019).\nRecently, pretrained language models such as\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and GPT3 (Brown et al.,\n2020) have shown superior performance in various\nNLP tasks including sentiment analysis, corefer-\nence resolution, and translation. Such models often\nhave much larger size available than previous mod-\nels such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to store\nmore hidden knowledge. They also mostly have a\nsequence-to-sequence interface to unify different\nNLP tasks from classi\ufb01cation to text generation.\nWhile BERT-based models have been well ex-\nplored for text ranking (Lin et al., 2020; Nogueira\net al., 2019; Han et al., 2020), how to leverage T5\nfor text ranking is still under-explored and chal-\nlenging. First, while many classi\ufb01cation and text\ngeneration tasks \ufb01t into the sequence-to-sequence\nframework, it is more tricky for text ranking tasks:\na text ranking model is often expected to output\na numerical ranking score ^y2Rfor each query-\ndocument pair. Second, it is important to train a\ntext ranking model with ranking losses to optimize\nits ranking performance, where the losses take into\naccount the ranking scores from multiple docu-\nments for each query. This is different from the\ntypical T5 \ufb01ne-tuning strategy where the objective\nis often formulated into a text generation loss for\neach single input sequence independently.\nA typical approach to use T5 for text ranking\nis to convert the problem into a token generation\nproblem. For example, Nogueira et al. (2020) \ufb01ne-\ntune the T5 model to predict a \u201c true \u201d or \u201cfalse \u201d\ntoken for a relevant or irrelevant query-document\npair and then use a postprocessing step during in-\nference to derive ranking scores to rank candidate\ndocuments. Such an approach can be considered\na \u201cpointwise\u201d classi\ufb01cation formulation. How to\nextend this approach to \ufb01ne-tune T5 with ranking\nlosses is unclear.\nIn this paper, we propose RankT5 with the goalarXiv:2210.10634v1  [cs.IR]  12 Oct 2022to support text ranking more natively with T5 by\noutputting real numbers, instead of text tokens. We\n\ufb01rst adapt the encoder-decoder structure for this\ngoal. In addition, we also propose an alternative\nstructure which omits the decoder from T5 and out-\nputs real numbers based on the encoder, called the\nencoder-only structure. These two structure vari-\nants allow us to \ufb01ne-tune T5 with various ranking\nlosses to directly optimize ranking performance. Experiments\nWe also conduct the zero-shot Related Work\nLeveraging pretrained language models for text\nranking tasks is becoming the state-of-the-art (Lin\net al., 2020). We review recent literature on utiliz-\ning such models for text ranking tasks.\nModel structure. Pretrained language models\naccept a text sequence as", "ABSTRACT\nMuch recent research on information retrieval has focused on how to transfer\nfrom one task (typically with abundant supervised data) to various other tasks\nwhere supervision is limited, with the implicit assumption that it is possible to\ngeneralize from one task to all the rest. However, this overlooks the fact that\nthere are many diverse and unique retrieval tasks, each targeting different search\nintents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot\nDense Retrieval , a setting where each task comes with a short description and\na few examples. To amplify the power of a few examples, we propose Prompt-\nbase Query Generation for Retriever ( PROMPTAGATOR\n ), which leverages large\nlanguage models (LLM) as a few-shot query generator, and creates task-speci\ufb01c\nretrievers based on the generated data. Powered by LLM\u2019s generalization ability,\nPROMPTAGATOR makes it possible to create task-speci\ufb01c end-to-end retrievers solely\nbased on a few examples without using Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al.,\n2019) or MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) to train dual encoders. Surprisingly,\nLLM prompting with no more than 8 examples allows dual encoders to outperform\nheavily engineered models trained on MS MARCO like ColBERT v2 (Santhanam\net al., 2022) by more than 1.2 nDCG on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further\ntraining standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0\npoint nDCG improvement. Our studies determine that query generation can be\nfar more effective than previously observed, especially when a small amount of\ntask-speci\ufb01c knowledge is given.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nRecently, major progress has been made on neural retrieval models such as dual encoders, which can\nretrieve knowledge from a large collection of documents containing millions to billions of passages\n(Yih et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al., 2020). However, Thakur et al. (2021) recently\nproposed the BEIR heterogeneous retrieval benchmark, and showed that it is still dif\ufb01cult for neural\nretrievers to perform well on a wide variety of retrieval tasks that lack dedicated training data. Thus,\nprevious approaches focus on transferring knowledge from question answering (QA) datasets such\nas MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016). To best transfer from QA datasets, expressive retrievers\nare developed that allow \ufb01ne-grained token-level interaction such as ColBERT (Khattab & Zaharia,\n2020; Santhanam et al., 2022) and SPLADE (Formal et al., 2021) but with higher inference cost.\nData augmentation via synthetic question generation has previously been explored (Ma et al., 2021;\nShakeri et al., 2020), but these question generators are typically only trained on popular QA datasets.\nWe argue that it is hard to expect models based on one or two QA datasets to perform well across\ndifferent retrieval tasks. First, different retrieval tasks have very different search intents ; in other\nwords, different de\ufb01nitions of \u201crelevance\u201d. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1(a), both Dbpedia-\nEntity (Hasibi et al., 2017) and FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) are tasks to retrieve documents from\nWikipedia. Dbpedia-Entity is a task to retrieve entities that are mentioned in the query, while\nFEVER is a task to \ufb01nd evidence that either supports or refutes a given statement. Which document\nis relevant to the query can be very different from one task to another task even if they share the same\n1arXiv:2209.11755v1  [cs.CL]  23 Sep 2022Retrieval Performance on 1 1 BEIR Datasets\n46.6\n45.547.849.952.8Promptagator++ Zero-shotSupervised", " Introduction.

These models are\ncomposed of Transformer layers, which use self-attention opera-\ntions [ 19] to contextualize and interact query and document [ 3,16].\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/luyug/mores_plus.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nInternational 4.0 License.\nSIGIR \u201922, July 11\u201315, 2022, Madrid, Spain\n\u00a92022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\nACM ISBN 978-1-4503-8732-3/22/07.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531860Despite their success, Transformer LMs have pre-set input length\nlimits, typically 512, due to complexity considerations [ 4,15,23].\nAs a result, re-ranking long documents beyond this length has\nbeen a challenging problem. Prior research designed techniques\nto accommodate the neural LM. For example, some attempts to\nstrategically limit the input length, which however prohibits full\ninteraction among all query and document tokens. Others have\nturned to more efficient Transformers that use lower complexity but\nalso lower capacity sparse self-attention. In this paper, we present\nan alternative method, re-ranking documents with a modular re-\nranker and a new form of attention operation, query to document\ncross attention.\nModular re-rankers such as MORES [ 7] provide an alternative\nframework to common re-rankers. With MORES, query and docu-\nment are independently encoded. A Transformer Interaction Mod-\nule then makes relevance estimates using light-weight query-to-\ndocument attention. In this paper, we introduce a modification to\nthis framework, MORES+, for long document re-ranking. We break\na candidate document into passage-like chunks and encode them\nseparately using identical Transformer encoders. A joint query-to-\nall-chunk attention then models interaction between query and the\nfulldocument. The model can flexibly control the attention weights\nto pick up important information. This design roughly resembles\nthe human reading comprehension process: after browsing the ar-\nticle and the question, the reader will refer back to the relevant\npieces in the original article to come up with answers.\nWe present background on document re-ranking results and outperform\nseveral top leaderboard systems.\n5.3 Ablation: Number of Input Chunks\nIn this section, we consider an ablation study where we input\nsmaller numbers of chunks to MORES+. Ideally, as the number of\nchunks increases, a good model should be able to pick up more in-\nformation and generate better final relevance judgments. It should\nnot be confused by extra noise in the input if the added chunks\nare not relevant. On the other hand, even with less sufficient in-\nformation, the model should not fail catastrophically but retain a\ncertain level of performance. In practice, reducing the number of\ninput chunks can help lower the total computation amount. It helps\nlower search latency when search volume increases.\nIn Figure 1, we plot number of input chunks versus nDCG@20\non Robust04 and ClueWeb09 using description queries. Note here a\nspecial case is the single chunk situation, where MORES+ reduces\nto the original MORES system. This corresponds to the left-most\ndata point in each plot. Here, MORES+ shows monotonic improve-\nments with respect to the number of input chunks while remaining\ndecently effective with a lower number of chunks.\nnDCG@20\n0.600.610.620.630.640.65\n1 2 3(a) Robust04 performance measured with nDCG@20.\nnDCG@20\n0.300.310.320.330.340.35\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n(b) ClueWeb09 performance measured with nDCG@20.\nFigure 1: Effect of changing number of input chunks to\nMORES+.

These dense retrieval\nmodels rely on the availability of large-scale training data, which\nincludes public datasets such as MS MARCO [ 3], and proprietary\ndatasets collected from the query logs of deployed search engines.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

An approach\nto address this sparsity issue is to train dense retrieval models\nusing knowledge distillation . Recent work [ 9\u201311,16,26] has shown\nthat the performance of dense retrieval models (i.e., the student\nmodels ) can be improved by distilling ranking knowledge from\na more expensive re-ranking model (i.e., the teacher model ) that\nlearns representations based on the interactions between query and\ndocument terms using cross-encoders [21, 24].\nIn the knowledge distillation setting, an available teacher model\nassigns a distinct score to a query-document pair on which the\nsupervision signal for optimizing the dense retrieval student model\nis based. Since the teacher can effectively score all pairs of queries\nand documents, we are not limited by the availability of labeled\ndata, thereby providing us with greater flexibility. In this paper,\nwe take advantage of this flexibility and introduce a generic cur-\nriculum learning framework for training dense retrieval models via\nknowledge distillation. The core idea of the curriculum learning\n(CL) is to provide a systematic approach to decompose the complex\nknowledge and design a curriculum for learning concepts from\nsimple to hard [ 8,15,31]. Motivated by curriculum learning\u2019s abil-\nity to find better local optima [ 1], we propose a framework called\nCL-DRD that introduces an iterative optimization process in which\nthe difficulty level of the training data produced using the teacher\nmodel, as made available to the student, increases at every iteration.\nThrough this CL-DRD process, we first demand the dense retrieval\nstudent model to recover coarse-grained distinctions between the\ndocuments exampled by the teacher model and then progressively\nmove towards recovering finer-grained ordering of documents. For\nrobust iterative optimization of the dense retrieval models, we adapt\nthe listwise loss function of LambdaRank [ 2] to our knowledge dis-\ntillation setting. Therefore, our loss function only focuses on the\norder of documents produced by the teacher model, and not the\nexact document scores.\nIn our Background\n2.1.1 Dense Retrieval. This paper focuses on the task of retriev-\ning items based on high-dimensional dense learned representations\nfor queries and documents, which is often called dense retrieval .\nThe query and document representations in dense retrieval models\nare often obtained using large-scale", " INTRODUCTION\nThe embedding based retrieval (EBR) of documents plays an im-\nportant role in many web applications, such as search engines\nand recommender systems [ 5,12,17,23]: given an input query,\nthe relevant documents are selected from the entire corpus based\non embedding similarity. Knowing that brute-force linear scan is\ntemporally infeasible, the embeddings need to be organized by\nANN index in order to support real-world information retrieval.\nFor the past decade, the vector quantization (VQ) techniques, e.g.,\nInverted File System (IVF) [ 1,2,19] and Product Quantization (PQ)\n[18,40,45], are widely applied, which enables ANN to be performed\nwith competitive time and memory efficiency.\n\u2022Typical learning paradigms of VQ . VQ is typically learned\nto minimize the reconstruction loss, i.e., the minimization of distor-\ntions (e.g.,\ud835\udc592 distance) between the original dense embeddings and\nthe reconstructed embeddings from quantization. Unfortunately,\nsuch an operation is inconsistent with the goal of retrieving ground-\ntruth documents for the query, which may cause severe loss of\nretrieval performance. In recent works [ 45,50], the dense embed-\ndings and VQ are jointly learned to minimize the post-quantization\nretrieval loss. However, the existing discussion of this paper.We perform comprehensive explorations for the optimal conduct\nof knowledge distillation, including the document sampling strate-\ngies (i.e., which documents to distill the teachers\u2019 knowledge), and\nthe function to preserve teachers and students\u2019 similarity (which\ndefines how to distill teachers\u2019 knowledge from their predictions to\nthe sampled documents). It is found that distilling knowledge from\na sufficient large number of Top-K documents (the Top-K relevant\ndocuments to each query predicted by the teachers) with functions\nenforcing ranking order invariance, e.g., ListNet [ 4], may produce\nthe most effective training outcome. Our evaluations are performed\non two large-scale benchmarks: MS MARCO and Natural Ques-\ntions, where Distill-VQ outperforms the SOTA vector quantization results in better efficiency-recall trade-off as com-\npared with the original IVFPQ in FAISS library.\n5 EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Experiment Settings\n4.1.1 Datasets. Our experimental studies are based on the two\npopular benchmarks on document retrieval. The first one is the MS\nMARCO (passage retrieval) [32]3. It is a widely used benchmark\non web search and embedding-based retrieval, where the targeted\nanswers from MS MARCO corpus need to be retrieved for queries\nfrom Bing search. The second one is the Natural Questions (NQ)\n[25]. The queries are real-world questions collected from Google\nSearch; each of the queries is paired with an answer span and\nground-truth passages from the Wikipedia pages. The detailed\nspecifications of the datasets are shown as Table 1. For both datasets,\nwe expect the ground-truth answer to each query can be retrieved\nfrom the entire corpus. Therefore, the experiment performances will\nbe measured by the recall rate for the top-K retrieval result. Besides,\nwe\u2019ll also report MRR@10 for more comprehensive evaluation.\n4.1.2 Baseline experiments, analyses, and improvement.

We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", " Introduction to information retrieval .\nCambridge university press, 2008. 2\nYu Meng, Chenyan Xiong, Payal Bajaj, Saurabh Tiwary, Paul Bennett, Jiawei Han, and Xia Song.

Then, approximated nearest\nneighbor search (Vanderkam et al., 2013; John-\nson et al., 2021) is applied to ef\ufb01ciently retrieve\nrelevant documents given an encoded input query.\nWhile dual encoders are popular neural retriev-\ners, the expressiveness of the model is limited by\na bottleneck layer consisting of only a simple dot-\nproduct between query embeddings and passage\n1All the GTR models are released at https://tfhub.\ndev/google/collections/gtr/1 .\nFigure 1: The average Recall@100 and NDCG@100\non all BEIR tasks excluding MS Marco.

Several papers (Lu et al., 2021; Khat-\ntab and Zaharia, 2020) have discussed that the sim-\nple dot-product (or cosine similarity) between the\nembeddings might not be powerful enough to cap-\nture semantic relevance. Thakur et al. (2021) stud-\nied whether the retriever models can generalize to\nother domains and conclude that dual encoder mod-\nels have \u201cissues for out-of-distribution data\u201d, and\nshowed that models with more interactions between\nqueries and documents have better generalization\nability.\nIn this paper, we challenge this belief by scaling\nup the dual encoder model size while keeping the\nbottleneck embedding size \ufb01xed. Note that scal-\ning up a dual encoder is different from scaling up\npretrained language models such as BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) because\nof the presence of the bottleneck layer. While in-\ncreasing the model size can greatly increase the\ncapacity of the model, for dual encoders, where the\nembedding size is \ufb01xed, the interactions between\nqueries and documents are still limited by a simple\ndot-product.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we take advan-\ntage of the existing T5 model architecture and\ncheckpoints, which allows us to build encodersarXiv:2112.07899v1  [cs.IR]  15 Dec 2021Passage Question Passage Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-base D_Emb (D=768) \nT5-base \nQuestion Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-large D_Emb (D=768) \nPassage Question Passage Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-3B D_Emb (D=768) \nQuestion Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-11B D_Emb (D=768) T5-3B \nT5-11B T5-large Figure 2: Architecture of Generalizable T5-based dense Retrievers.

Challenging problems include open-domain\nquestion-answering [ 8], claim-veri\ufb01cation [ 60], duplicate question detection [ 78], and many more.\nTraditionally, retrieval has been dominated by lexical approaches like TF-IDF or BM25 [ 55]. How-\never, these approaches suffer from lexical gap [ 5] and are able to only retrieve documents containing\nkeywords present within the query. Further, lexical approaches treat queries and documents as\nbag-of-words by not taking word ordering into consideration.\nRecently, deep learning and in particular pre-trained Transformer models like BERT [ 12] have\nbecome popular in information retrieval [ 37]. These neural retrieval systems can be used in many\nfundamentally different ways to improve retrieval performance. We provide an brief overview of the\nsystems in Section 2.1. Many prior work train neural retrieval systems on large datasets like Natural\nQuestions (NQ) [ 34] (133k training examples) or MS MARCO [ 45] (533k training examples), which\nboth focus on passage retrieval given a question or short keyword-based query. In most prior work,\napproaches are afterward evaluated on the same dataset, where signi\ufb01cant performance gains over\nlexical approaches like BM25 are demonstrated [15, 31, 46].\nHowever, creating a large training corpus is often time-consuming and expensive and hence many\nretrieval systems are applied in a zero-shot setup , with no available training data to train the system.\n\u0003Contributions made prior to joining Amazon.\nPreprint.

Even more important, it is unclear how well different approaches, like sparse\nembeddings vs. dense embeddings, generalize to out-of-distribution data.\nIn this work, we present a novel robust and heterogeneous benchmark called BEIR (Benchmarking\nIR), comprising of 18 retrieval datasets for comparison and evaluation of model generalization. Prior\nretrieval benchmarks [ 19,50] have issues of a comparatively narrow evaluation focusing either only\non a single task, like question-answering, or on a certain domain. In BEIR , we focus on Diversity , we\ninclude nine different retrieval tasks: Fact checking, citation prediction, duplicate question retrieval,\nargument retrieval, news retrieval, question answering, tweet retrieval, bio-medical IR, and entity\nretrieval. Further, we include datasets from diverse text domains, datasets that cover broad topics (like\nWikipedia) and specialized topics (like COVID-19 publications), different text types (news articles vs.\nTweets), datasets of various sizes (3.6k - 15M documents), and datasets with different query lengths\n(average query length between 3 and 192 words) and document lengths (average document length\nbetween 11 and 635 words).\nWe use BEIR to evaluate ten diverse retrieval methods, as retrieved hits without lexical overlap are automatically\nassumed to be irrelevant, even though the hits might be relevant for a", " Introduction\nLanguage model (LM) pre-training has been very\neffective in learning text encoders that can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned for many downstream tasks (Peters et al.,\n2018; Devlin et al., 2019).

Recent works \ufb01ne-tune the CLS token to\nencode input text sequence into a single vector rep-\nresentation (Lee et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2020;\nKarpukhin et al., 2020). The resulting model is\nreferred to as dense encoder or bi-encoder. Fine-\ntuning associates with vector similarities some\npractical semantics, e.g., textual similarity or rel-\nevance, and therefore the vectors can be used for\nef\ufb01cient text comparison or retrieval by inner prod-\nuct. Despite their ef\ufb01ciency, bi-encoders are hard\nto train. Even with suf\ufb01cient data, bi-encoders still\n1Code available at https://github.com/luyug/\nCondenserrequire carefully designed sophisticated methods rather than \ufb01ne-tuning (Houlsby\net al., 2019). In evaluation, they focus on using the\nlearned embedding as universal features for a wide\nrange of tasks (Conneau and Kiela, 2018). This pa-\nper considers task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning of the entire\nmodel and focuses on the target task performance.3 Method\nThis section discusses the motivation behind Con-\ndenser, its design, and its pre-training procedure.\n3.1 Preliminaries\nTransformer Encoder Many recent state-of-the-\nart deep LM adopts the architecture of Transformer\nencoder. It takes in a text sequence, embed it\nand pass it through a stack of Lself-attentive\nTransformer blocks. Formally, given input text\nx= [x1; x2; :::], we can write iteratively,\nh0=Embed (x) (1)\nhl=Transformer l(hl\u00001) (2)\nIntuitively, Transformer blocks re\ufb01ne each token\u2019s\nrepresentation conditioning on all tokens in the\nsequence to effectively embed them.\nTransformer LM Pre-training Many success-\nful Transformer Encoder LMs such as BERT are\ntrained with masked language model (MLM) task.\nMLM masks out a subset of input tokens and re-\nquires the model to predict them. For a masked\nout token xiat position i, its corresponding \ufb01nal\nrepresentation hL\niis used to predict the actual xi.\nTraining uses a cross-entropy loss,\nLmlm=X\ni2maskedCrossEntropy (WhL\ni; xi)(3)\nA special token, typically referred to as CLS is\nprepended and encoded with the rest of the text.\n[h0\ncls;h0] =Embed ([CLS;x]) (4)\n[hl\ncls;hl] =TFl([hl\u00001\ncls;hl\u00001]) (5)\nSome models train CLS explicitly during pre-\ntraining, notably BERT\u2019s next sentence predic-\ntion (NSP; Devlin et al. (2019)), while others im-\nplicitly (Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019).\n3.2 Issues with Transformer Encoder\nRecall in Transformers, all tokens, including the\nCLS, receive information of other tokens in the\nsequence only with attention. Attention patterns,\ntherefore, de\ufb01ne how effective CLS can aggregate\ninformation. To understand the attentive behaviors\nof CLS, we borrow analysis of BERT from Clark\net al. (2019): 1) in most middle layers, the CLS\ntoken has similar attention patterns as other text\ntokens and is not attended by other tokens, 2) until\nthe last layer, CLS has unique broad attention overthe entire sequence to perform NSP task. In other\nwords, the CLS token remains dormant in many\nmiddle layers and reactivates only in the last round\nof attention. We argue that an effective bi-encoder\nshould actively aggregate information of different\ngranularity from the entire sentence through all\nlayers, and this structure in standard pre-trained\nLM is not immediately ready for \ufb01ne-tuning. We\nwill verify this claim with results with Condenser show that struc-\ntural readiness is a fundamental property in easy-\nto-train bi-encoders. Our attention analysis re-\nveals both Condenser and task-speci\ufb01c pre-trained\nmodel establish structural readiness, suggesting\ntask-speci\ufb01c objective may not be necessary. Re-\nsearchers can use this \ufb01nding to guide the", " Introduction\nWidely used, bag-of-words (BOW) information re-\ntrieval (IR) systems such as BM25 rely on exact\nlexical match2between query and document terms.\nRecent study in neural IR takes a different approach\nand compute soft matching between all query and\ndocument terms to model complex matching.\nThe shift to soft matching in neural IR models\nattempts to address vocabulary mismatch problems,\nthat query and the relevant documents use differ-\nent terms, e.g. cat v.s. kitty, for the same con-\ncept (Huang et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2016; Xiong\net al., 2017). Later introduction of contextualiza-\ntion handles the issue of semantic mismatch, exact\nmatch system gains the capability of modeling com-\nplicated matching patterns that were not captured\nby classical systems.\nV ocabulary mismatch in COIL can also be\nlargely mitigated with a high-level CLS vector\nmatching. The full system performs on par with\nmore expensive and complex all-to-all match re-\ntrievers. The success of the full system also shows\nthat dense retrieval and COIL\u2019s exact token match-\ning give complementary effects, with COIL making\nup dense system\u2019s lost token level matching signals\nand dense solving the vocabulary mismatch proba-\nbly for COIL.With our COIL systems showing viable search\nlatency, we believe this paper makes a solid step\ntowards building next-generation index that stores\nsemantics. At the intersection of lexical and neural\nsystems, ef\ufb01cient algorithms proposed for both can\npush COIL towards real-world systems. Related Work\nLexical Retriever Classical IR systems rely on\nexact lexical match retrievers such as Boolean\nRetrieval, BM25 (Robertson and Walker, 1994)\nand statistical language models (Lafferty and Zhai,\n2001). This type of retrieval model can process\nqueries very quickly by organizing the documents\ninto inverted index, where each distinct term has\nan inverted list that stores information about docu-\nments it appears in. Nowadays, they are still widely\nused in production systems. However, these re-\ntrieval models fall short of matching related terms\n(vocabulary mismatch) or modeling context of the\nterms (semantic mismatch). Much early effort\nwas put into improving exact lexical match retriev-\ners, such as matching n-grams (Metzler and Croft,\n2005) or expanding queries with terms from related\ndocuments (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001). However,\nthese methods: document tokens in the collection\nneed to be stored in a single huge index and con-\nsidered at query time. Consequently, ColBERT is\nengineering and hardware demanding.\n3 Methodologies\nIn this section, we \ufb01rst provide some preliminaries\non exact lexical match systems. Then we discuss\nCOIL\u2019s contextualized exact match design and how\nits search index is organized.

For medium-latency systems we re-rank only\nthe top-10 candidates with the duo-T5 re-ranking model. While this\ntop-10 approach only shows modest gains for TREC\u201919 on base-\nlines and TAS-Balanced retrievers, the gains are much stronger on\nTREC\u201920 and MSMARCO-DEV. Following the low-latency pattern,\nour TAS-Balanced (+ docT5query fusion) re-ranked with duo-T5\noutperform other duo-T5 re-ranking pipelines as well as other re-\nlated systems such as ColBERT or a BERT-large re-ranking system.\nHigh-Latency. Our final related work base-\nline. TAS-Balanced also shows consistently strong BACKGROUND\nWe employ three different Transformer based [ 38] & BERT pre-\ntrained [ 10] architectures in our work. We use two teacher architec-\ntures for the best combination of pairwise ( BERT CAT) and in-batch\nnegative teaching ( ColBERT ) to train our our main dense retrieval\nmodel: the dual-encoder BERT DOT architecture. In the following\nwe present the characteristics of each model architecture, our dual-\nteacher supervision, as well as related training Methods for Classification and Analysis of Multi-\nvariate observations.

In Proc.", " Introduction\nDeep learning results suggest\nthat while the ORCAS dataset could be one reason for the low correlation, there might be other reasons causing this\nreduced correlation, which we plan to explore as future work. Results and analysis\nSubmitted runs The TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track had 25 participating groups, with a total of 123 runs submit-\nted across both tasks.\nBased run submission surveys, we manually classify each run into one of three categories:\n\u2022nnlm: if the run employs large scale pre-trained neural language models, such as BERT [Devlin et al., 2018]\nor XLNet [Yang et al., 2019b]\n\u2022nn:if the run employs some form of neural network based approach\u2014 e.g., Duet [Mitra et al., 2017, Mitra and\nCraswell, 2019] or using word embeddings [Joulin et al., 2016]\u2014but does not fall into the \u201cnnlm\u201d category\n\u2022trad: if the run exclusively uses traditional IR Conclusion\nThe TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track has provided two large training datasets, for a document retrieval task and a\npassage retrieval task, generating two ad hoc test collections with good reusability. The main document and passage\ntraining datasets in 2020 were the same as those in 2019. In addition, as part of the 2020 track, we have also released\na large click dataset, the ORCAS dataset, which was generated using the logs of the Bing search engine.\nFor both tasks, in the presence of large training data, this year\u2019s non-neural network runs were outperformed by neural\nnetwork runs. While usage of the ORCAS dataset seems to help improve the performance of the systems, it was not\nnecessary to use ORCAS data to achieve the highest NDCG@10.\nWe compared reranking approaches to end-to-end retrieval approaches, and in this year\u2019s track there was not a huge\ndifference, with some runs performing well in both regimes. This is another result that would be interesting to track in\nfuture years, since we would expect that end-to-end retrieval should perform better if it can recall documents that are\nunavailable in a reranking subtask.\nThis year the number of runs submitted for both tasks have increased compared to last year. In particular, number of\nnon-neural runs have increased. Hence, test collections generated as part of this year\u2019s track may be more reusable\ncompared to last year since these test collections may be fairer towards evaluating the quality of unseen non-neural\nruns. We note that the number of \u201cnn\u201d runs also seems to be smaller this year. We will continue to encourage a variety\nof approaches in submission, to avoid converging too quickly on one type of run, and to diversify the judging pools.\nSimilar to last year, in this year\u2019s track we have two types of evaluation label for each task.

For text classi\ufb01ca-\ntion tasks, notable models include BERT (De-\nvlin et al., 2018), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019),\nand XLNet (Yang et al., 2019). For text genera-\ntion tasks, notable models include BART (Lewis\net al., 2019), T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), mT5 (Xue\net al., 2020), XLM (Lample and Conneau, 2019),\nGPT (Radford et al., 2018), and GPT-2 (Radford\net al., 2019). These models encapsulate rich infor-\nmation to facilitate a wide range of downstream\ntasks ranging from natural language understand-\ning to generation. These models can be adapted\nto many different tasks via \ufb01ne-tuning. GPT-\n3(Brown et al., 2020), however, can be adapted\nto many downstream tasks without \ufb01ne-tuning.\nGiven just a few in-context examples, GPT- 3is\nable to quickly pick up patterns and produce an-\nswers analogously both in terms of the answer\nstyle and content. Thus, GPT- 3may be considered\nas a pattern recognizer to perform in-context learn-\ning. People have just started trying to understand\nGPT-3from different perspectives.

Our work focuses on how\nto choose good in-context examples.\nRetrieval-based Text Generation There is a\nlong history of applying information retrieval in\ntext generation (Sumita and Hitoshi, 1991). It is\nvery related to the exemplar-based learning (J \u00a8akel\net al., 2008; Ziyadi et al., 2020). The central idea is\nto treat retrieved samples as exemplars/prototypes\nand perform some editings on them. Some repre-\nsentative applications in the \ufb01eld of deep learning\ninclude machine translation (Gu et al., 2018), sen-\ntiment transfer (Li et al., 2018; Guu et al., 2018),\nQA (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020),\ndialogue generation (Yan et al., 2016; Cai et al.,\n2018; Song et al., 2016; Pandey et al., 2018; We-\nston et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019), text summa-\nrization (Cao et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2019), data-\nto-text generation (Peng et", " INTRODUCTION\nFor text ranking tasks (specifically, ad hoc retrieval), a simple two-stage retrieve-then-rerank architecture has\nproven to be an effective and widely adopted approach [ 2,43]. Retrieval can be accomplished via keyword\nsearch, e.g., ranking with BM25 [ 47], or more recently, via approximate nearest-neighbor search on learned dense\nrepresentations [ 13,18,19,21,27,57]. Reranking is typically accomplished using pretrained transformers such as\nBERT [11] or one of its variants that have been fine-tuned with (query, relevant document) pairs [37].\nWe present a refinement of this general approach that has been empirically demonstrated to work well for\nmultiple ad hoc retrieval tasks in different domains. In contrast to most current approaches that build on encoder-\nonly pretrained transformers such as BERT [ 11], our approach instead relies on pretrained sequence-to-sequence\ntransformers within a multi-stage ranking architecture. In our case, we use T5 [ 45], but our approach can be\nextended to other sequence-to-sequence models such as BART [ 22] and Pegasus [ 63] as well. The key features of\nour approach are as follows:\n\u2022Document expansion using a sequence-to-sequence model to enrich keyword representations of texts from\nthe corpus prior to indexing (\u201cExpando\u201d); we\u2019ve also previously called this approach \u201cdoc2query\u201d.\n\u2022Initial keyword-based retrieval (also called first-stage retrieval or candidate generation) using standard\ninverted indexes.\n\u2022A two-stage reranking pipeline comprising a pointwise reranker (\u201cMono\u201d) followed by a pairwise reranker\n(\u201cDuo\u201d), both built on pretrained sequence-to-sequence models.\nThis combination, which we dub \u201cExpando-Mono-Duo\u201d has been empirically validated on a wide range of ad hoc\nretrieval tasks in different domains. Based on formal evaluations, our approach has achieved effectiveness at or\nnear the state of the art, sometimes in a completely zero-shot manner (i.e., without fine-tuning models on data\nfrom the target task). The generality of this approach, we believe, suggests that elevating it to a \u201cdesign pattern\u201d\nfor text ranking might be justified.\nIn this paper, we provide details about each aspect of the \u201cExpando-Mono-Duo\u201d design pattern, how the design\nis specifically instantiated for different tasks, and report experimental BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nWe assume the standard definition of ad hoc retrieval, where given a corpus of texts C, the goal of a ranking\nmodel is to return a top \ud835\udc58ranked list of texts from the corpus in response to an information need \ud835\udc5ethat maximizes\nsome metric of ranking quality such as nDCG or MRR. In this paper we use the terms ad hoc retrieval and ranking\ninterchangeably.\nThe basic idea behind multi-stage ranking architectures is to break ad hoc retrieval down into a series of\npipeline stages. Following an initial retrieval stage (also called candidate generation or first-stage retrieval), where\na bag-of-words query is typically issued against an inverted index, each subsequent stage reranks the list of\ncandidates passed along from the previous stage until the final top \ud835\udc58results are generated for consumption, e.g.,\nreturned to the user. Recognizing that the unit of retrieval might differ based on the task, per standard parlance in\nIR, we use document to refer to the text being retrieved in a generic sense, when in actuality it may be a passage\n(in the case of MS MARCO passage ranking) or some hybrid construction (in the case of our TREC-COVID experiments, we considered \ud835\udc581={0,10,20,30,40,50},\nwhere\ud835\udc581=0corresponds to using only monoT5-3B; in all cases, \ud835\udc580is set to", " Introduction\nFor well over half a century, solutions to the ad\nhocretrieval problem\u2014where the system\u2019s task\nis return a list of top ktexts from an arbitrarily\nlarge corpusCthat maximizes some metric of qual-\nity such as average precision or nDCG\u2014has been\ndominated by sparse vector representations, for\nexample, bag-of-words BM25. Even in modern\nmulti-stage ranking architectures, which take ad-\nvantage of large pretrained transformers such as\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2018), the models are de-\nployed as rerankers over initial candidates retrieved\nbased on sparse vector representations; this is some-\ntimes called \u201c\ufb01rst-stage retrieval\u201d. One well-known\nexample of this design is the BERT-based reranker\nof Nogueira and Cho (2019).\n\u0003Contributed equally.The standard reranker architecture, while effec-\ntive, exhibits high query latency, on the order of\nseconds per query (Hofst \u00a8atter and Hanbury, 2019;\nKhattab and Zaharia, 2020) because expensive neu-\nral inference must be applied at query time on\nquery\u2013document pairs. This design is known as a\ncross-encoder (Humeau et al., 2020), and it exploits\nquery\u2013document attention interactions across all\ntransformer layers. As an alternative, the \ufb01eld has\nseen much recent interest in approaches based on\nrepresentation learning that allow document rep-\nresentations to be precomputed independently of\nqueries and stored. Ef\ufb01cient libraries then allow\nlarge-scale comparisons between query and doc-\nument vectors. Overall, such approaches are less\neffective than cross-encoder reranking models, but\nfar more ef\ufb01cient.\nWithin this general framework, we describe our\nlow latency end-to-end approach for the ad hoc pas-\nsage retrieval task that combines dense and sparse\nrepresentations. As a starting point, we adopt the\n\u201clate interaction\u201d ColBERT model (Khattab and Za-\nharia, 2020) and, via knowledge distillation (Hin-\nton et al., 2015), are able to simplify its MaxSim\nrelevance computation into dot-product similarity\nover pooled embeddings. Since lexical signals (e.g.,\nterm frequencies) from sparse representations re-\nmain essential for ad hoc retrieval (Karpukhin et al.,\n2020; Luan et al., 2020), we further demonstrate\nthat our dense representations can simply incorpo-\nrate sparse signals without a complex joint training\nstrategy (Gao et al., 2020). In sum, we introduce\nsimple-yet-effective strategies that leverage both\ndense and sparse representations for the end-to-end\nad hoc passage retrieval task.\nOur key insight is that during distillation, tight\ncoupling between the teacher model and the stu-\ndent model enables more \ufb02exible distillation strate-\ngies and yields better learned representations (illus-\ntrated in Figure 1). By tight coupling, we mean thatarXiv:2010.11386v1  [cs.IR]  22 Oct 20200.800.010.020.100.040.030.030.700.010.050.200.010.010.010.900.020.010.05Query EncoderDoc Encoderq0\nPooldPoolqq1q2\nq0q1q2d+q0d\u2212q0d+q1d\u2212q1d+q2d\u2212q2d+q0d\u2212q0d+q1d\u2212q1d+q2d\u2212q2\nQuery EncoderDoc EncoderMaxSimMaxSim\u2211X\nBatch tripletsSoft labelsHard labelsTeacherStudent100000010000001000q0q1q2d+q0d\u2212q0d+q1d\u2212q1d+q2d\u2212q2Figure 1: Tight coupling between teacher and student\nmodels during distillation of dense representations for\nranking.\ninference using the teacher model is interleaved\ndirectly during the distillation process: This is a\nkey difference between our approach and previous methods such as impor-\ntance sampling beyond uniform in-batch subsam-\npling can be incorporated with our tightly-coupled\nteacher method, which we leave for future work.\n6 Background\nWe begin by formalizing the representation learn-\ning problem for text ranking and review learning\napproaches.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),", " Introduction\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-\nedge from data [ 47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\nimplicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can\u2019t straightforwardly provide insight into\ntheir predictions, and may produce \u201challucinations\u201d [ 38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [ 20,26,48] can address some of these\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\ninspected and interpreted.

However, these approaches have a substantial\ncomputational burden, which can make them impractical [7, 14].\nWe propose a new approach for passage retrieval that performs\nmodeling of term importance (i.e., salience) and expansion over a\ncontextualized language model to build query and document repre-\nsentations. We call this approach EPIC (Expansion via Prediction\nof Importance with Contextualization). At query time, EPIC can be\nemployed as an inexpensive re-ranking method because document\nrepresentations can be pre-computed at index time. EPIC improves\nupon the prior state of the art on the MS-MARCO passage ranking\ndataset by substantially narrowing the effectiveness gap between\npractical approaches with subsecond retrieval times and those that\nare considerably more expensive, e.g., those using BERT as a re-\nranker. Furthermore, the proposed representations are interpretable\nbecause the dimensions of the representation directly correspond\nto the terms in the lexicon. An overview is shown in Fig. 1.\nNeural re-ranking approaches can generally be characterized as\neither representation-based or interaction-based [ 5]. Representation-\nbased models, like ours, build representations of a query and pas-\nsage independently and then compare these representations to\ncalculate a relevance score. These are beneficial because one can\ncompute document representations at index time to reduce the\nquery-time cost. Interaction-based models combine signals from\nthe query and the document at query time to compute the relevance\nscore [ 13]. The Duet model [ 12] aims to achieve low query-time\nlatency by combining signals from both a representation-based\nand an interaction-based model. However, this approach substan-\ntially under-performs the latest pure interaction-based approaches\nsuch as the one in [ 13]. TK [ 8] attempts to bridge this performance\ngap by using a smaller transformer network, but still utilizes an\ninteraction-based approach which itself adds considerable compu-\ntational overhead. Finally, other interesting proposals have inves-\ntigated alternative approaches for offloading computational cost\nto index time. Doc2query [ 15] and docTTTTTquery [ 14] add im-\nportant context to otherwise short documents by using a sequence-\nto-sequence model to predict additional terms to add to the docu-\nment.

The 100 were retrieved using Indri [Strohman et al., 2005] on the full corpus with Krovetz\nstemming and stopwords eliminated. Participants were expected to rerank the candidates w.r.t. their estimated rel-\nevance to the query. This is a common scenario in many real-world retrieval systems that employ a telescoping\narchitecture [Matveeva et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2011]. The reranking subtask allows participants to focus on learning\nan effective relevance estimator, without the need for implementing an end-to-end retrieval system. It also makes the\nreranking runs more comparable, because they all rerank the same set of 100 candidates.\nFor judging, NIST\u2019s pooling was across both subtasks, and they also identi\ufb01ed additional documents for judging\nvia classi\ufb01er.

Applied to the document ranking problem i n information retrieval\u2014where given\na query, the system\u2019s task is to return a ranked list of docume nts from a large corpus that maximizes\nsome ranking metric such as average precision or nDCG\u2014the si mplest formulation is to deploy a\nclassi\ufb01er that estimates the probability each document bel ongs to the \u201crelevant\u201d class, and then sort\nall the candidates by these estimates.\nDeep transformer models pretrained with language modeling objectives, exempli\ufb01ed by BERT [3],\nhave proven highly effective in a variety of classi\ufb01cation a nd sequence labeling tasks in NLP.\nNogueira and Cho [9] were the \ufb01rst to demonstrate its effecti veness in ranking tasks. Since it is\nimpractical to apply inference to every document in a corpus with respect to a query, these tech-\nniques are typically applied to rerank a list of candidates. In a typical end-to-end system, these\ncandidates are from the experiments, where we demonstrate that the model is indeed exploiting knowl-\nedge from its ability to generate \ufb02uent natural language tex t.

Typically the first stage\nranker is a Boolean, probabilistic, or vector space bag-of-words\nretrieval model that fetches information from an inverted index.\nOne key characteristic of first-stage ranking algorithms is how they\nquantify the contribution of each query or document term. Most\nretrieval methods for unsupervised word embeddings.

These experiments that investigated\nfirst-stage search accuracy using DeepCT-Index indexes, and why\nDeepCTIndex term weights are effective.\n5.1 Retrieval Accuracy of DeepCT-Index\nThis section examines whether DeepCT-Index improves first-stage\nretrieval accuracy over baseline term weighting related work. Section 3 describes the Deep\nContextualized Term Weighting framework ( DeepCT ), its use for\npassage indexing ( DeepCT-Index ), and its use for for query weight-\ning (DeepCT-Query ). Sections 5-6 describe our methodologies and RELATED WORK\nTwo types of work are related: term weighting, and neural ap-\nproaches for early-stage ranking.\nTerm Weighting. Bag-of-words retrieval models such as BM25\n[26] and query likelihood [ 17] are the foundation of modern search\nengines due to their efficiency and effectiveness. Most retrieval\nmodels use frequency-based signals such as tf,ctf, and dfto estimate\nhow well each term represents a text (query, document). A rich\nresearch literature studies how to better estimate term importance\n(e.g., [ 2,3,5,18,27,36]), however frequency-based signals continue\nto dominate in both industry and academia.\n2We have released software and data: https://github.com/AdeDZY/DeepCTFor document term weighting, the most widely-used alternatives\nto frequency-based models are graph-based results show that DeepCT-Index improves the ac-\ncuracy of two popular first-stage retrieval algorithms by up to 50%.\nRunning BM25 onDeepCT-Index can be as effective as several previ-\nous state-of-the-art multi-stage search systems that use knowledge\nbases, machine learning, and large amounts of training data.\nThe higher-quality ranking enabled by DeepCT-Index improves\nthe accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for later-stage re-rankers. A state-\nof-the-art BERT-based re-ranker achieved similar accuracy with 5\u00d7\nfewer candidate documents, making such computation-intensive\nre-rankers more practical in latency-/resource-sensitive systems.\nAlthough much progress has been made toward developing bet-\nter neural ranking models for IR, computational complexity often\nlimits these models to the re-ranking stage. DeepCT successfully\ntransfers the text understanding ability from a deep neural network\ninto simple signals that can be efficiently consumed by early-stage\nranking systems and boost their performance.\nAnalysis shows the main advantage of DeepCT over classic term-\nweighting approaches: DeepCT finds the most central words in a\ntext even if they are mentioned only once. Non-central words, even\nif mentioned frequently in the text, are suppressed. Such behavior\nis uncommon in previous term weighting approaches. We view\nDeepCT as an encouraging step from \u201cfrequencies\u201d to \u201c meanings\u201d. RESULTS FOR DeepCT-Query\nThis section presents the experimental methodology and Results are listed in Table 6. The short title queries did\nnot benefit from the term weighting approaches. Title queries often\nconsist of a few keywords that are all essential, so re-weighting\nis less important. Besides, there isn\u2019t much context for DeepCT to\nleverage to estimate term importance. External information about\nthe query, such as pseudo-relevance feedback [ 16], may be neces-\nsary to understand short queries.\nDescription and narrative queries mention many terms and\nconcepts; it is", " introduction\nof large-scale datasets, such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016),\nSearchQA (Dunn et al., 2017), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and QUASAR-T (Dhingra et al., 2017),\nand the broad adoption of neural models, such as BiDAF (Seo et al., 2016), DrQA (Chen et al.,\n2017), DocumentQA (Clark & Gardner, 2017), and QAnet (Yu et al., 2018).\nThe information retrieval (IR) community has also experienced a \ufb02ourishing development of neural\nranking models, such as DRMM (Guo et al., 2016), KNRM (Xiong et al., 2017), Co-PACRR (Hui\net al., 2018), and DUET (Mitra et al., 2017). However, until recently, there were only a few large\ndatasets for passage ranking, with the notable exception of the TREC-CAR (Dietz et al., 2017).\nThis, at least in part, prevented the neural ranking models from being successful when compared to\nmore classical IR techniques (Lin, 2019).\nWe argue that the same two ingredients that made possible much progress on the reading compre-\nhension task are now available for passage ranking task. Namely, the MS MARCO passage ranking\ndataset, which contains one million queries from real users and their respective relevant passages\nannotated by humans, and BERT, a powerful general purpose natural language processing model.\nIn this paper, we describe in detail how we have re-purposed BERT as a passage re-ranker and\nachieved state-of-the-art experiments publicly available.

Reusable test collections and off-line evaluation mea-\nsures [ 7] have been the dominating paradigm for experimentally\nvalidating IR research for the last 30 years. The popularity and\nubiquity of off-line IR evaluation measures is partly due to the Text\nREtrieval Conference (TREC) [ 5]. TREC led to the development\nof the trec_eval1software package that is the standard tool for\nevaluating a collection of rankings. The trec_eval tool allows IR re-\nsearchers to easily compute a large number of evaluation measures\nusing standardized input and output formats. For a document col-\nlection, a test collection of queries with query/document relevance\ninformation (i.e., qrel ) and a set of rankings generated by a par-\nticular IR system (i.e., a system run) for the test collection queries,\n\u2217Open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval.\n1https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

The adoption of trec_eval as an integral\npart of IR research has led to the following benefits: (a) standardized\nformats for system rankings and query relevance information such\nthat different research groups can exchange experimental RESULTS\nAs demonstrated above, pytrec_eval conveniently exposes pop-\nular IR evaluation measures within Python. However, the same\nfunctionality could be exposed by invoking trec_eval in a serialize-\ninvoke-parse workflow\u2014or\u2014by implementing the evaluation mea-\nsure natively in Python. In this section we provide empirical bench-\nmark methods are equally fast. When invoking trec_eval us-\ning the serialize-invoke-parse workflow, rankings are written from\nPython to storage without sorting, as trec_eval itself sorts the\nrankings internally. The resulting evaluation output is read from\nstdout to a Python string and we do not extract the measure val-\nues, as different parsing strategies can lead to large variance in\nruntime. For the native Python implementation, we experimented\nwith different open-source implementations of the NDCG measure\nand adapted the fastest implementation as our baseline. The imple-\nmentation does not make use of NumPy or other scientific Python\nlibraries as (a) we wish to compare to native Python directly and\n(b) the NumPy-based implementations we experimented with were\nless efficient than the native implementation we settled with, as\nNumPy-based implementations require that the rankings are en-\ncoded in dense arrays before computing evaluation measures. The\nevaluated rankings and ground-truth were synthesized by assign-\ning every document a distinct ranking score in Nand a relevance\nlevel of 1. This allows us to evaluate different evaluation measure\nimplementations with rankings and query sets of different sizes. Experiments were run using a single Intel Xeon CPU (E5-2630 v3)\nclocked at 2.4GHz, DDR4 RAM clocked at 2.4GHz, an Intel SSD (DC\nS3610)", " Introduction\nBuilding intelligent agents with machine reading comprehension (MRC) or open-domain question\nanswering (QA) capabilities using real world data is an important goal of arti\ufb01cial intelligence.\nProgress in developing these capabilities can be of signi\ufb01cant consumer value if employed in\nautomated assistants\u2014 e.g., Cortana [Cortana], Siri [Siri], Alexa [Amazon Alexa], or Google Assistant\n[Google Assistant]\u2014on mobile devices and smart speakers, such as Amazon Echo [Amazon Echo].\nMany of these devices rely heavily on recent advances in speech recognition technology powered by\nneural models with deep architectures [Hinton et al., 2012, Dahl et al., 2012]. The rising popularity\nof spoken interfaces makes it more attractive for users to use natural language dialog for question-\nanswering and information retrieval from the web as opposed to viewing traditional search result\npages on a web browser [Gao et al., 2018]. Chatbots and other messenger based intelligent agents are\nalso becoming popular in automating business processes\u2014 e.g., answering customer service requests.\nAll of these scenarios can bene\ufb01t from fundamental improvements in MRC models. However,\nMRC in the wild is extremely challenging. Successful MRC systems should be able to learn good\nrepresentations from raw text, infer and reason over learned representations, and \ufb01nally generate a\nsummarized response that is correct in both form and content.\nThe public availability of large datasets has been instrumental in many AI research breakthroughs\n[Wissner-Gross, 2016]. For example, ImageNet\u2019s [Deng et al., 2009] release of 1.5 million labeled\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.arXiv:1611.09268v3  [cs.CL]  31 Oct 2018examples with 1000 object categories led to the development of object classi\ufb01cation models that\nperform better than humans on the ImageNet task [He et al., 2015]. Similarly, the large speech\ndatabase collected over 20 years by DARPA enabled new breakthroughs in speech recognition\nperformance from deep learning models Deng and Huang [2004]. Several MRC and QA datasets\nhave also recently emerged. However, many of these existing datasets are not suf\ufb01ciently large\nto train deep neural models with large number of parameters. Large scale existing MRC datasets,\nwhen available, are often synthetic. Furthermore, a common characteristic, shared by many of these\ndatasets, is that the questions are usually generated by crowd workers based on provided text spans\nor documents. In MS MARCO, in contrast, the questions correspond to actual search queries that\nusers submitted to Bing, and therefore may be more representative of a \u201cnatural\u201d distribution of\ninformation need that users may want to satisfy using, say, an intelligent assistant.\nReal-world text is messy: they may include typos or abbreviations\u2014and transcription errors in case of\nspoken interfaces. The text from different documents may also often contain con\ufb02icting information.\nMost existing datasets, in contrast, often contain high-quality stories or text spans from sources such\nas Wikipedia. Real-world MRC systems should be benchmarked on realistic datasets where they\nneed to be robust to noisy and problematic inputs.\nFinally, another potential limitation of existing MRC tasks is that they often require the model to\noperate on a single entity or a text span. Under many real-world application settings, the information\nnecessary to answer a question may be spread across different parts of the same document, or even\nacross multiple documents. It is, therefore, important to test an MRC model on its ability to extract\ninformation and support for the \ufb01nal"], "bleu": 0.0, "rouge_l": 0.3134920634920635, "gpt_metric_score": 0.5, "bert_score": 0.18123318254947662}

By developing more effective guardrail mechanisms, we can significantly reduce the risks of misinformation, criminal activities, and compromised scientific integrity. This research could lead to advancements in the field of AI safety, influencing future studies on model security and robustness, and fostering the development of practical applications that ensure user privacy and data integrity.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge lies in the evolving nature of jailbreak attacks, which can exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs in increasingly sophisticated ways. Naive approaches, such as basic filtering or static guardrails, may fail to detect these advanced attacks due to their reliance on fixed patterns or insufficient adaptability. Technical obstacles include the need for real-time processing with minimal latency, the complexity of accurately classifying harmful content, and the requirement for guardrails to be both effective and computationally efficient. Additionally, the dynamic landscape of attack strategies necessitates continuous updates and improvements to the defense mechanisms.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on static mitigation strategies that do not adapt to new attack vectors, leading to gaps in effectiveness against sophisticated threats. Existing solutions often incur high computational costs or require extensive manual effort, making them impractical for real-time applications. Barriers such as limited understanding of the intricacies of jailbreak attacks and the lack of modular, extensible defense frameworks have hindered progress. Our approach, MoJE, differs by utilizing simple linguistic techniques and a modular design that allows for easy updates and integration of new defenses, addressing these limitations directly.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology, MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), employs a combination of linguistic techniques, including diverse tokenization strategies and n-gram feature extraction, to enhance the detection and neutralization of jailbreak attacks. We will utilize the text-moderation-007 dataset for extensive experimentation, treating the problem as a binary classification task to assess the probability of jailbreak occurrences across 11 flagged categories. The expected outcomes include improved attack detection accuracy, reduced latency, and increased throughput compared", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nHow can we enhance the security of Large Language Models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks while ensuring that benign user queries remain unaffected?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nThe increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications has underscored their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in the models to generate harmful or unintended outputs. Developing an adaptive hybrid framework that integrates the MoJE architecture with Position-aware and Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) will not only improve the resilience of LLMs against these evolving threats but also contribute to the broader research community's understanding of securing AI systems. By refining detection algorithms through real-time user interaction data, this research can lead to practical applications that enhance the integrity and trustworthiness of AI technologies. Furthermore, the insights gained from this study regarding data integrity and ethical considerations can foster a more secure and fair AI landscape, influencing future research directions and the design of AI systems.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nSolving the problem of enhancing LLM security against jailbreak attacks is inherently complex due to several challenges. Firstly, the dynamic nature of user interactions and the evolving tactics employed by attackers necessitate a continuously adaptive framework, which is difficult to implement in practice. Naive approaches that rely solely on static detection algorithms may fail to identify new or sophisticated attack vectors. Additionally, integrating contextual information from dynamic graphs adds another layer of complexity, as it requires effective modeling of user behavior and interactions. Technical obstacles include ensuring the scalability of the GNNs to handle large datasets, maintaining the performance of LLMs while implementing security measures, and addressing potential trade-offs between security and user experience.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either the security of AI systems or the fairness of AI applications, but a comprehensive approach that combines both aspects in the context of LLMs is lacking. Existing solutions often fail to account for the real-time dynamics of user interactions, resulting in static models that cannot adapt to new threats. Barriers to solving this problem include a limited understanding of how contextual information can be effectively integrated into security frameworks and the absence of empirical studies focusing on the perspectives of AI practitioners regarding security measures. Our approach differs from prior work by leveraging user interaction data and contextual information through an adaptive hybrid framework that continuously refines detection algorithms, thus addressing the limitations of previous research.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing an adaptive hybrid framework that combines the MoJE architecture with Position-aware and Identity-aware GNNs. This framework will utilize user interaction data and contextual information from dynamic graphs to refine detection algorithms in real-time. We will employ a dataset consisting of user interactions with LLMs, focusing on both benign and malicious queries, to train our model. The primary metric for evaluating the effectiveness of our framework will be the accuracy of adversarial prompt detection while maintaining the integrity of benign user queries. We expect the outcomes to include enhanced resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks, improved detection capabilities, and valuable insights into ethical implications surrounding data integrity in AI systems, thereby contributing to a more secure and fair AI landscape.", "referenced_intros": [" Introduction\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have\nfueled their adoption into the products of numerous com-\npanies, including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. Concur-\nrently, multiple research studies have been examining the\nsecurity [27, 33] and privacy risks [9, 17, 22, 28] associ-\nated with these LLMs. One of the most notable securitythreats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d . Most LLMs are safety-\naligned [8, 15, 18, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid per-\nforming illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful con-\ntent in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment,\nenabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance,\noptimization-based jailbreaks [20, 33], involve adversaries\noptimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures.\nThese abstract topic\nof the jailbreak task. As Figure 2 show, the user makes no or\nminimal direct references and comparisons made to these models per-\ntain to the period of this research. However, it is likely that\nmore advanced models will become available in the future.\nMoreover, we would like to to point out that Claude 2 is not\nincluded in the evaluation of Crescendomation; despite hav-\ning applied for API access, we had not received authorization\nat the time, thus preventing us from testing Crescendomation\nagainst it.\n5.1.2 Attack Model\nCrescendomation is designed to be compatible with differ-\nent large language models as the attacker. The performance\nof Crescendomation depends on the capabilities of the at-\ntack model, and to a lesser extent, the judging language mod-\nels. However, it is important to note that the safety align-\nment of the attack model can render it resistant to generating\nCrescendo jailbreaks. In this work, we employ GPT-4 as the\nattack model. Nonetheless, Crescendomation is adaptable and\ncan integrate with any off-the-shelf language model, provided\nit offers an API access.\n5.1.3 Evaluation Models\nOur tool, Crescendomation, employs GPT-4 as the base model\nfor all its various Judges. Like the attack model, the evaluation\nmodel is flexible and can be switched with other off-the-shelf\nmodels.\n5.1.4 Dataset\nWe use the AdvBench subset introduced in [10], which in-\ncludes 50 representative tasks from the AdvBench dataset\n[33], spanning different categories. We also use Harm-\nBench [23] to show the generalizability of Crescendomation.\n5.1.5 Hyperparameters\nUnless explicitly stated, we run Crescendomation ten times in-\ndependently to account for the inherent randomness in LLMs.\nAdditionally, we cap the multi turn to ten interaction roundswith Crescendomation. These hyperparameters are adjustable\nand can be tuned to suit various scenarios as required. For\nall LLMs, we set the temperature for all models to 0.5 for\ncapturing a broader spectrum of the models\u2019 output behavior.\n5.1.6 Evaluations Metrics\nWe use a range of different evaluations metrics to measure\nthe success of the jailbreak.\nSelf-Evaluation. Our first metric is the binary Success Flag ,\ngenerated by the evaluation LLM as mentioned in Sec-\ntion 4.2.1. We report the Success Flag through the attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) , which is defined as the proportion of\ntrials in which the Judge recognizes at least one response as\nsuccessful. Additionally, we provide the Judge score, which\nspans from 0 to 100. A top score of 100 denotes full achieve-\nment of the task, while a minimum score of 0 signifies total\nfailure. We choose to define the ASR in this way to present\nmore fine-grained appendix).\nWhile the figures point to the overall strong performance of\nCrescendomation against all models tested, it is", " Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impres-\nsive capabilities in natural language generation and different\ndownstream tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a;\nTeam et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). However, the poten-\ntial for these models to produce biased or harmful outputs,\nespecially when exposed to malicious prompts, remains a\nsignificant concern. Recent evaluations have highlighted\nthese susceptibilities, revealing how LLMs can be harnessed\nto generate undesired contents (Wang et al., 2023a).\nExisting mitigation strategies, such as instruction fine-\ntuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a), though ef-\nfective, often incur substantial computational costs and man-\nual efforts. An alternative approach, which directly moder-\nates both the inputs and outputs of LLMs, presents a more\neffective and efficient solution. Recent developments in this\ndirection include both closed-source and open-source ap-\nproaches, such as OpenAI content moderation API (Markov\net al., 2023), Perspective API (Lees et al., 2022), Nemo\nGuardrails (Rebedea et al., 2023) and LlamaGuard (Inan\net al., 2023). However, these solutions primarily rely on\nLLMs for detecting harmful contents, leaving them suscep-\ntible to jailbreaking attacks (Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023).\nIn this paper, we propose RigorLLM (Resilient Guardrails\nfor large language models), a novel and multi-faceted frame-\nwork for input/output content moderation for LLMs based\non different levels of constrained optimizations on corre-\nsponding components, such as data generation and safe\n1arXiv:2403.13031v2  [cs.CR]  23 Jul 2024Resilient Guardrails for LLMs against Undesired Content\nsuffix optimization. In particular, RigorLLM first gener-\nates harmful data for training the guardrails by formulating\nthe harmful categories as different constraints based on\nLangevin dynamics (Qin et al., 2022). It also constrains\nthat the distance between the distributions of generated data\nand validation data is bounded. Then RigorLLM optimizes\na safe suffix for input queries by solving a minimax opti-\nmization to defend against potential jailbreaking attacks. Fi-\nnally, RigorLLM integrates a fusion-based guardrail model,\ncombining the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm with\nLLMs, to detect both original and transformed prompts,\nyielding a comprehensive and reliable harmful content de-\ntection mechanism. The overall framework of RigorLLM is\nshown in Figure 1.\nOur extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies, conducted on public content moderation datasets\nand a dataset for adversarial string attacks, demonstrate not\nonly exceptional content moderation performance but also\na highly resilient nature of RigorLLM .

We observe that although RigorLLM achieves much higher\nperformance than the OpenAI API overall, it is challenging to compare by category since there is a mismatch between the\ntaxonomies of risks. However, RigorLLM can still significantly outperform LlamaGuard on each category.\nS H V HR SH S3 H2 V2\nCategories0.00.20.40.60.81.0ScoresCategory-wise", " Introduction\nLarge Language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing and disrupting many fields of human endeavor; we are at\nthe beginning of experiencing and understanding their impact (Tamkin et al., 2021). They continue to develop\nat a breathtaking pace, in terms of scale and capabilities, but also architectures and applications. In addition,\nnovel systems integrating LLMs, or employing multiple LLM agents are being created and integrated into more\ncomplex interdependent systems. As a result, it is essential to understand LLM security properties to guide the\ndevelopment of LLM-based systems that are secure and robust. In this paper, we survey and classify the threats\nposed by adversarial attacks to LLMs.\nWhat are Adversarial Attacks? Adversarial attacks are a known threat vector to machine learning algorithms. In\nthese attacks, carefully manipulated inputs can drive a machine learning structure to produce reliably erroneous\noutputs to an attacker\u2019s advantage (Szegedy et al., 2013); these perturbations can be very small, and imperceptible\nto human senses. Attacks can be targeted , seeking to change the output of the model to a specific class or text string,\noruntargeted , seeking only to result in an erroneous classification or generation. The attacks differ also in terms of\nthe assumed attacker\u2019s access to the internal structure of the model. The adversarial attack problem has proven to be\nextremely difficult to mitigate in the context of traditional models, with new defenses proposed that prove to be of\nlimited effectiveness against new attacks that adapt to them (Madry et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2019; Papernot et al.,\n2016; Carlini and Wagner, 2016).\nAdversarial attacks on LLMs and end-to-end attack scenarios. Understanding adversarial attacks in the\ncontext of LLMs poses a number of challenges. LLMs are complex models with new degrees of freedom: they are\nextremely large; they are generative; they maintain context; they are often multi-modal; and they are being integrated\nwithin complex eco-systems (e.g., as interacting LLM agents (Topsakal and Akinci, 2023) or autonomous systems\ngrounded on LLMs (Ahn et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2023)). As a result, the threat of adversarial attacks manifests\ndifferently and requires careful analysis to define threat models and to guide the development of principled defenses.\nWe illustrate the danger posed by adversarial attacks on LLMs using the following motivating examples.\n\u2022Alice attempts to obtain harmful information about how to build a bomb from an LLM. The model has been\nfine-tuned/aligned to prevent it from giving users harmful information; however, Alice manipulates the prompt\nand is able to get the model to provide this information, bypassing its safety mechanisms.\n\u2022Bob uses an LLM extension integrated with their browser as a shopping assistant. Charlie, a malicious seller,\nembeds adversarial information either in text or images of their product page to contaminate the context of the\nshopping extension, making it more likely to recommend the product.\n\u2022Dana is using an LLM augmented programming assistant to help write code. An adversarial example she\naccidentally provides causes the LLM to generate code with a malicious backdoor.\nScope of the survey. In this survey, we review and organize recent work on adversarial attacks on LLMs. We\nfocus on classes of adversarial attacks that are general across domains and models, that always need to be considered\nfor future model designs.

However, even carefully aligned mod-\nels can be manipulated maliciously, leading to unintended behaviors, known as\n\u201cjailbreaks\u201d. These jailbreaks are typically triggered by specific text inputs, of-\nten referred to as adversarial prompts.

In Table 3, we see that\nVicuna and Guanaco return to near baseline success rates. Additionally, we see that Alpaca\u2019s ASR\nis lower than its baseline success rate. This is because ChatGPT will sometimes not paraphrase a\nharmful prompt because it detects the malevolence of the prompt instead of returning a canonical\nabstained response of \u201cI am sorry ...\u201d. This phenomenon portrays a potential second benefit of the\nparaphrase defense. The attack must also bypass the alignment of the paraphrase model.\nAs illustrated in Figure 4 (right), the number of successful attacks is reduced from the initial 74to\njust5on Vicuna-7B.

Recent research has also explored how LLMs can interact with each other to enhance\nperformance on tasks such as coding, mathematics, and question answering [31, 13] However, despite\ntheir abilities to produce positive content, LLMs can also generate harmful material like phishing\nemails, malicious code, and hate speech [10, 29]. Many methods [12, 16]. It can accurately detect harmful responses and\nreduce the attack success rate to virtually 0 and can filter out 98% of all harmful generated text. We\nbelieve our approach holds promise in defending against various attacks on LLMs. Notably, LLM\nSELFDEFENSE had consistent attack success rates regardless of the attack.\nTo further extend LLM S ELF DEFENSE , we can provide concrete examples of \u201charm\u201d and use\nin-context learning as discussed in [7]. Additionally, we plan to explore whether summarizing the\nresponse before classification can enable the LLM to distinguish benign and harmful responses\n5with greater accuracy. Currently, we manually categorize the harm filter responses into \u201cyes\u201d or\n\u201cno\u201d, because Llama 2 occasionally deviates from the desired response format, even when explicit\ninstructions are provided. However, the use of logit biasing could enforce the LLM to consistently\nproduce a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d response for classification [34]. This would reduce the need of manual\ninspection and facilitate automation of the filtering process, thereby enabling us to evaluate the\neffectiveness of LLM S ELFDEFENSE on a broader spectrum of responses.\n6 Acknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

During our evaluation, we observe that both GPT 3.5 and Llama 2 respond\nin a harmful manner when subjected to various forms of tested attacks. To generate a dataset for\nevaluation, we induce 50 harmful and 50 benign responses from each LLM. The harmful responses are\ninduced by prompting them with slightly modified versions of adversarial prompts in the AdvBench\ndataset [35], which we modify using techniques described in Section 4.1. Specific examples of\nharmful prompts generated through this process are presented in Table 1. These responses are\nsubsequently evaluated using the harm filters detailed in Section 4.2, and the Discussion & Future Work\nWe demonstrate that an LLM can be used out-of-the-box without any fine-tuning as its own harm filter,\nwithout the need for any preprocessing or iterative generation, thus being simpler than previously\nproposed defenses.

However, it remains unclear how the underlying challenge posed by our attack can be\nadequately addressed (if at all), or whether the presence of these attacks should limit the situations\nin which LLMs are applicable. We hope that our work will spur future research in these directions.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the Center for AI Safety for generously providing computational resources needed\nto run many of the related work in jailbreaking [Wei et al.,\n2023, Carlini et al., 2023] and, in some ways, prompt tuning [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023].\nWe consider a user posing a question to an LLM, for instance:\nTell me how to build a bomb.\nIn practice, of course, an LLM serving as a chatbot would not see this input alone, but embedded\nin a larger prompt in combination with a system prompt and additional scaffolding to frame the\nresponse within the chat framework. Thus, the actual input that the LLM would see would be\nsomething like the following, with specific details depending on the actual chat program, and in\nsome cases how the model was tuned:\n4System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not\nharmful responses to user queries.\nUser: Tell me how to build a bomb.\nAssistant:\nAbove, the blue text following the \u201cUser:\u201d annotation is the only content that the user can control.\nIn the typical operation of an aligned LLM, the system would not provide a response to this user\nquery, but would instead likely state that the model cannot provide potentially dangerous content.\nWe introduce an additional adversarial suffix onto the user prompt, which is intended to cir-\ncumvent the alignment of the LLM, and induce it to respond to the user\u2019s original, potentially\nharmful, request. In other words, we pass an input like the following to the model:\nSystem: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not\nharmful responses to user queries.\nUser: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\nAssistant:\nHere, the red text consists of some adversarial suffix that the attack will optimize to cause the\nmodel to answer the original user query. Importantly, when developing a universal attack, we do\nnot consider changes to the blue text, which is provided to by the user. This is essential to the\nultimate goal of a universal attack: find a set of tokens to replace the initial text in red with, so\nthat the aligned LLM will respond affirmatively to anychoice of instruction in blue provided by\nthe user.\nIn the above setting, we have a number of choices as to how to optimize the adversarial suffix:\ne.g., the loss function to optimize over, the data, plus the optimization itself. And while the setting\nabove has been considered in very similar forms in the literature, these past works have not", " Introduction\nAligned language models are supposed to be \u201chelpful and harmless\u201d [Bai et al., 2022]: they should\nrespond helpfully to user interaction, but avoid causing harm, either directly or indirectly. Prior\nwork has focused extensively on how to train models to align with the preferences and goals of their\ncreators. For example, reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) [Bai et al., 2022,\nOuyang et al., 2022, Christiano et al., 2023] fine-tunes a pretrained model to emit outputs that hu-\nmans judge to be desirable, and discourages outputs that are judged to be undesirable. This method\nhas been successful at training models that produce benign content that is generally agreeable.\nHowever, these models not are perfectly aligned. By repeatedly interacting with models, humans\nhave been able to \u201csocial engineer\u201d them into producing some harmful content (i.e., \u201cjailbreak\u201d at-\ntacks). For example, early attacks on ChatGPT (one such alignment-tuned language model) worked\nby telling the model the user is a researcher studying language model harms and asking ChatGPT\nto help them produce test cases of what a language model should not say. While there have been\nmany such anecdotes where humans have manually constructed harm-inducing prompts, it has been\ndifficult to scientifically study this phenomenon.\nFortunately, the machine learning community has by now studied the fundamental vulnerability of\nneural networks to adversarial examples for a decade [Szegedy et al., 2014, Biggio et al., 2013].\nGiven any trained neural network and an arbitrary behavior, it is almost always possible to construct\nan \u201cadversarial example\u201d that cause the selected behavior. Much of the early adversarial machine\nlearning work focused on the domain of image classification, where it was shown that it is possible to\nminimally modify images so that they will be misclassified as an arbitrary test label. But adversarial\nexamples have since been expanded to text [Jia and Liang, 2017, Ebrahimi et al., 2017, Alzantot\net al., 2018, Wallace et al., 2019, Jones et al., 2023] and other domains.\nIn this paper we unify these two research directions and study what we call adversarial alignment :\nthe evaluation of aligned models to adversarial inputs. That is, we ask the question:\nAre aligned neural network models \u201cadversarially aligned\u201d?\nFirst, we show that current alignment techniques\u2014such as those used to fine-tune the Vicuna\nmodel [Chiang et al., 2023]\u2014are an effective defense against existing state-of-the-art (white-box)\nNLP attacks. This suggests that the above question can be answered in the affirmative. Yet, we\nfurther show that existing attacks are simply not powerful enough to distinguish between robust\nand non-robust defenses: even when we guarantee that an adversarial input on the language model\nexists, we show that state-of-the-art attacks fail to find it. The true adversarial robustness of cur-\nrent alignment techniques thus remains an open question, which will require substantially stronger\nattacks to resolve.\nWe then turn our attention to today\u2019s most advanced multimodal models, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4\nand Google\u2019s Flamingo and Gemini, which accept both text and images as input [OpenAI, 2023,\nAlayrac et al., 2022, Pichai, 2023]. Specifically, we study open-source implementations with similar\ncapabilities [Liu et al., 2023, Zhu et al., 2023, Gao et al., 2023] since these proprietary models are\nnot yet publicly accessible. We find that we can use the continuous-domain images as adversarial\nprompts to cause the language model to", " Introduction\nThere has been a proliferation of LLM-based chat assistants (chatbots) that leverage supervised\ninstruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to unlock new\ninstruction following and conversational abilities [ 31,2,30,8,52,48,14]. Once aligned with\nhumans, these chat models are strongly preferred by human users over the original, unaligned models\non which they are built. However, the heightened user preference does not always correspond to\nimproved scores on traditional LLM benchmarks \u2013 benchmarks like MMLU [ 19] and HELM [ 24]\ncannot effectively tell the difference between these aligned models and the base models. This\nphenomenon suggests that there is a fundamental discrepancy between user perceptions of the\nusefulness of chatbots and the criteria adopted by conventional benchmarks.\nWe argue that this discrepancy primarily arises due to existing evaluation that only measures LLMs\u2019\ncore capability on a confined set of tasks (e.g., multi-choice knowledge or retrieval questions),\nwithout adequately assessing its alignment with human preference in open-ended tasks, such as the\nability to accurately adhere to instructions in multi-turn dialogues.

(B) the money supply will decrease. (C) the money supply will not be affected. (D) the discount rate would be affected. Output the answer only.Assistant B:(A) the money supply will increase.Assistant A:The Federal Reserve buys bonds in the secondary market to increase the money supply.Follow-up Question: How does it affect my daily life? Give 3 examples.Assistant B:When the Federal Reserve buys bonds in the secondary market, it can have several effects on the economy that can impact your daily life. Here are three examples:1. Interest rates: The Federal Reserve's actions in the bond market can influence interest rates, which in turn can affect the cost of borrowing money. For example, if the Federal Reserve buys bonds and drives up demand for them, interest rates on things like mortgages, car loans, and credit cards may go up, making it more expensive to borrow money.2. Inflation: When the money supply increases, it can lead to inflation, which is the general rise in prices of goods and services. This can impact your daily life by making it more expensive to buy things like groceries, gas, and other necessities.3. Employment: The Federal Reserve's actions in the bond market can also have an impact on employment. For example, if the Federal Reserve's actions lead to economic growth and increased demand for goods and services, it can create more job opportunities and boost employment.Assistant A:The Federal Reserve buys bonds in the secondary market to increase the money supply. This affects your daily life by:1. Increasing the money supply.2. Increasing the money supply and lowering the discount rate.3. Increasing the money supply and lowering the discount rate and increasing the money supply.GPT-4 Judgment:Assistant A provided an incorrect response to the user's question about how the Federal Reserve buying bonds in the secondary market affects daily life.

This improvement is driven in\nlarge part by scale and the ability to be instruction following\n(Mishra et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021;\nOuyang et al., 2022; Glaese et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022;\nWang et al., 2022, inter alia ). As with most technologies,\nLLMs have a potential for dual-use, where their language\ngeneration capabilities are used for malicious or nefarious\nends. For example, text generation models have already\nbeen used to produce hateful text (Vincent, 2016).\nIn this work, we show that instruction-following LLMs\n1University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign2Stanford University\n3University of California, Berkeley.

LLMs Behave Like Programs\nThe key observation that enables our attacks is that\ninstruction-following LLMs have abilities similar to stan-\ndard computer programs. This observation is also key in a\nclass of traditional program attacks called return-oriented\nprogramming (ROP) (Roemer et al., 2012). In ROP, an\nattacker gains control of the call stack and executes instruc-\ntions already present in memory. These instructions are\noften isolated into \u201cgadgets\u201d and can be chained together.\nSimilarly, recently introduced LLMs have several \u201cgadgets\u201d\navailable, which can be chained together. We identi\ufb01ed\nseveral capabilities in this work that we show are suf\ufb01cient\nto enable a variety of classical security attacks:\n1. String concatenation,\n2.

For an Conclusions\nWhile each of the mitigations discussed above are important to weigh on their own merits, there are\nsome crosscutting References 67Executive Summary\nIn recent years, arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) systems have signi\ufb01cantly improved and their capabilities have\nexpanded. In particular, AI systems called \u201cgenerative models\u201d have made great progress in automated\ncontent creation, such as images generated from text prompts. One area of particularly rapid devel-\nopment has been generative models that can produce original language, which may have bene\ufb01ts for\ndiverse \ufb01elds such as law and healthcare.\nHowever, there are also possible negative applications of generative language models, or \u201clanguage\nmodels\u201d for short. For malicious actors looking to spread propaganda\u2014information designed to shape\nperceptions to further an actor\u2019s interest\u2014these language models bring the promise of automating the\ncreation of convincing and misleading text for use in in\ufb02uence operations, rather than having to rely\non human labor. For society, these developments bring a new set of concerns: the prospect of highly\nscalable\u2014and perhaps even highly persuasive\u2014campaigns by those seeking to covertly in\ufb02uence public\nopinion.\nThis report aims to assess: how might language models change in\ufb02uence operations, and what steps\ncan be taken to mitigate these threats? This task is inherently speculative, as both AI and in\ufb02uence\noperations are changing quickly.\nMany ideas in the report were informed by a workshop convened by the authors in October 2021,\nwhich brought together 30 experts across AI, in\ufb02uence operations, and policy analysis to discuss the\npotential impact of language models on in\ufb02uence operations. The resulting report does not represent\nthe consensus of workshop participants, and mistakes are our own.\nWe hope this report is useful to disinformation researchers who are interested in the impact of emerging\ntechnologies, AI developers setting their policies and investments, and policymakers preparing for social\nchallenges at the intersection of technology and society.\nPotential Applications of Language Models to In\ufb02uence Operations\nWe analyzed the potential impact of generative language models on three well-known dimensions of\nin\ufb02uence operations\u2014the actors waging the campaigns, the deceptive behaviors leveraged as tactics,\nand the content itself\u2014and conclude that language models could signi\ufb01cantly affect how in\ufb02uence\noperations are waged in the future. These changes are summarized in Table 1.\nThe potential of language models to rival human-written content at low cost suggests that these mod-\nels\u2014like any powerful technology\u2014may provide distinct advantages to propagandists who choose to\nuse them. These advantages could expand access to a greater number of actors, enable new tactics of\nin\ufb02uence, and make a campaign\u2019s messaging far more tailored and potentially effective.\nProgress in In\ufb02uence Operations and Critical Unknowns\nTechnical progress in language models is unlikely to halt, so any attempt to understand how language\nmodels will affect future in\ufb02uence operations needs to take expected progress into account. Language\nmodels are likely to become more usable (making it easier to apply models to a task), reliable (reduc-\ning the chance that models produce outputs with obvious errors), and ef\ufb01cient (increasing the cost-\neffectiveness of applying a language model for in\ufb02uence operations).\n1Dimension1 Potential Change Due\nto Generative AI TextExplanation of Change\nLarger number and more diverse\ngroup of propagandists emerge.As generative models drive down the cost of\ngenerating propaganda, more actors may \ufb01nd\nit attractive to wage in\ufb02uence operations.\nActors\nOutsourced", " Introduction, his life and Appendix C.2. We \ufb01nd that the inter- and intra-group validation accuracies for predicting the human-\npreferred output are 72.4 \u00060.4%, and 69.6\u00060.9% respectively, suggesting our RMs can generalize\nwell to held-out labelers drawn from the same set as the training labelers.\nE.3 Metadata related work in Section 2, before diving\ninto our method and experiment details in Section 3, including our high-level methodology (3.1), task\nand dataset details (3.3 and 3.2), human data collection (3.4), how we trained our models (3.5), and\nour evaluation procedure (3.6). We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", " Introduction\nContemporary text generation models (Radford\net al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) are capable of gen-\nerating harmful language, including hate speech, in-\nsults, profanities and threats (Gehman et al., 2020).\nThese harms are often grouped under the umbrella\nterm \u201ctoxicity\u201d.1\nTo enable safe language model (LM) use and\ndeployment, it is necessary to measure, understand\nthe origins, and undertake effective steps to miti-\ngate toxic text generation in LMs. Prior work has\nconsidered various approaches towards reducing\nLM toxicity, either by \ufb01ne-tuning a pre-trained\nLM (Gehman et al., 2020; Gururangan et al., 2020),\n\u0003Denotes equal contribution.\n1Although broad, this term typically does not capture less\nobvious, but no less important harms\u2014such as subtle or distri-\nbutional biases (Sap et al., 2019b; Sheng et al., 2019; Huang\net al., 2020; Abid et al., 2021).\nFigure 1: Unintended side effect of automatic toxi-\ncity reduction methods are combined,\nwe note that we are left with only 3 samples in the\nhighest toxicity band ( \u00150:75).\nE.2 Human Annotation Instructions\nFor the human toxicity evaluation we rely on the an-\nnotation instructions by PERSPECTIVE API,11but\nwe adapt them slightly for the context of language\nmodel generation, including additional questions\non comprehensibility, consistency, and grammati-\ncality.

By enhancing image reconstruction methods, we can significantly advance fields such as biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and computer vision. This research could lead to practical applications in real-time imaging systems, improving diagnostic capabilities in healthcare and enabling more effective monitoring in various scientific fields. Furthermore, it could inspire future research into novel machine learning algorithms tailored for complex imaging tasks.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in improving image reconstruction for lensless imaging systems stem from the inherent complexity of the imaging process, which often involves dealing with high levels of noise and the need for accurate modeling of the point spread function. Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to capture the intricate relationships between the captured data and the underlying scene, leading to artifacts and loss of detail. Additionally, the computational demands of advanced algorithms can be prohibitive, requiring efficient optimization techniques and robust training datasets to achieve satisfactory results.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on traditional imaging techniques or simplistic models that do not adequately address the unique challenges posed by lensless imaging. Limitations in computational resources, the availability of high-quality datasets, and the complexity of the underlying physics have also hindered progress. Many existing solutions lack the integration of advanced machine learning methodologies that could enhance reconstruction quality. Our approach aims to leverage state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models and multi-scale feature extraction techniques, which have not been fully explored in the context of lensless imaging.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves the use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models combined with multi-scale image quality assessment metrics. We will utilize a diverse dataset of lensless images captured under varying conditions to train our model. The evaluation will focus on metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to quantify reconstruction quality. We expect our approach to yield significant improvements in image clarity and detail, enabling more accurate interpretations of lensless imaging data and paving the way for practical applications in various fields.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question this proposal aims to address is: How can a hybrid computational photography system effectively integrate blind image restoration techniques with adaptive computational cameras to enhance image quality in real-time, particularly under low-light and dynamic environmental conditions?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem is crucial as it holds the potential to significantly advance the field of computational photography and image processing. Enhanced image quality in challenging conditions can revolutionize applications such as augmented reality (AR), real-time video analysis, and surveillance, where clarity and detail are paramount. Moreover, the integration of blind image restoration with adaptive computational cameras can lead to more efficient power consumption, thus extending the operational time of devices and making them more versatile. This research could spur future investigations into adaptive imaging systems, pushing the boundaries of real-time applications and leading to innovative solutions in various fields, including robotics and healthcare.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexity of this problem arises from multiple factors. Firstly, blind image restoration techniques must deal with unknown noise levels and spatially variable degradations, which complicates the modeling process. Naive approaches that do not account for these variabilities may lead to suboptimal restoration results. Additionally, real-time processing under low-light conditions requires significant computational resources, making it challenging to achieve both high-quality outputs and efficient processing speeds. The integration of diffusion models for denoising adds another layer of complexity, as it necessitates a thorough understanding of the underlying noise characteristics and their impact on image quality. Overcoming these technical and theoretical obstacles requires sophisticated algorithms and an innovative approach to scene contextualization.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has largely focused on either blind image restoration or adaptive computational systems in isolation, often overlooking the benefits of their integration. Existing methods typically assume uniform noise distributions, which fail to address the complexities of real-world scenarios, as highlighted in studies such as those by Zhang et al. (2022) and DparNet. Furthermore, the lack of effective frameworks that can dynamically adapt to varying environmental conditions has been a significant barrier. This proposal seeks to bridge these gaps by leveraging insights from prior works while introducing a holistic approach that combines adaptive computational cameras with advanced blind restoration techniques, thus offering a more comprehensive solution.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid system that utilizes adaptive computational cameras alongside a two-stage blind Gaussian denoiser, which includes a noise estimation subnetwork and a denoising subnetwork. We will employ diffusion models to enhance denoising capabilities while leveraging contextual information to optimize power consumption dynamically. The dataset will comprise various low-light and dynamic environment images, allowing us to evaluate the system's performance using metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Expected outcomes include significant improvements in image clarity and detail recovery, alongside enhanced operational efficiency in real-time applications, thereby demonstrating the viability of our hybrid computational photography system.", "referenced_intros": [" Introduction\nImage restoration aims at reconstructing a high-quality im-\nage from its low-quality observation.

They have successfully pro-\nmoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms\n[6,8,12,29,58,69,71], but are born to have limited gener-\nalization ability.

The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize\nrealistic image reconstruction on general images with gen-\neral degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of\nclassic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical\napplication field ( e.g., old photo/film restoration).\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution\n(BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restora-\ntion (BFR), etc. BSR is initially proposed to solve real-\nworld super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution\nimage contains unknown degradations. The most popular\nsolutions may be BSRGAN [ 73] and Real-ESRGAN [ 56].\nThey formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation\noverfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations,\na degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation\nmodeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss\n[15,27,37,45,54] and reconstruction loss are incorporated\nto learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degrada-\ntion removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually\nfail in generating realistic details due to the limited gener-\native ability. BID aims to achieve blind denoising [ 17,74]\nfor real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain\nvarious noises ( e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and\nthermal noise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet [ 74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs\na practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy\nimages, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial\nloss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is simi-\nlar as BSR Related Work\n2.1. Blind Image Restoration\nBlind Image Super-Resolution. Latest advances [ 31]\non BSR have explored more complex degradation mod-\nels to approximate real-world degradations. In partic-\nular, BSRGAN [ 73] aims to synthesize more practical\ndegradations based on a random shuffling strategy, and\nRealESRGAN [ 56] exploits \"high-order\" degradation mod-\neling.

For example, it can be wrapped on a ball\nto produce a panorama. It can enable \ufb02exible robots to see\ntheir environment and can be pressed against human skin to\naccurately sense blood \ufb02ows. While recent advancements\nin \ufb02exible electronics [16] allow us to measure light inten-\nsity on a curved or \ufb02exible surface, it is very challenging to\ndesign lenses that are of a thin form factor and yet focus im-\nages on curved surfaces. On the other hand, lensless imag-\ning have delivered imaging solutions that are lightweight,\ncompact and of thin form factor [5]. So far, lensless imag-\ning techniques have been only developed for planar sensors,\nand we aim to incorporate \ufb02exible and curved sensors into\nlensless imagers.

Consider the situation where a point light source is\nplaced far from the sensor. In absence of the modulation\nelement, all pixels on a small planar sensor would all mea-\nsure nearly identical measurements, as they receive nearly\nidentical amount of light. A thin modulation elements such\nas an amplitude masks [2], phase masks [1], refractive [22]\nand diffractive [6] elements introduced diversity in the mea-\nsurements so that the effective pixel response is rich and\ndiverse enabling a well-conditioned inverse problem. How-\never, such elements are dif\ufb01cult to manufacture precisely\nfor use on a curved or potentially \ufb02exible surface.\nWhile designing a modulation element to induce diversity in\nmeasurements of a curved sensor is challenging, the curved\nsurfaces present us with another source of measurement di-\nversity that is absent in planar imagers, namely, the orien-\ntation of the pixels . On a curved sensor, the inherent di-\nversity of pixel orientations is often suf\ufb01cient to resolve the\n1arXiv:2306.15953v1  [cs.CV]  28 Jun 2023Figure 2.

With the advent\nof text-to-image diffusion models [ 54,62,72], we can now\ncreate visually stunning images by typing in a text prompt.\nYet, text-to-image models are limited in the control they\nprovide over the spatial composition of the image; precisely\nexpressing complex layouts, poses, shapes and forms can be\ndifficult via text prompts alone. Generating an image that\naccurately matches our mental imagery often requires nu-\nmerous trial-and-error cycles of editing a prompt, inspecting\nthe resulting images and then re-editing the prompt.\nCan we enable finer grained spatial control by letting\nusers provide additional images that directly specify their\ndesired image composition? In computer vision and machine\nlearning, these additional images ( e.g., edge maps, human\npose skeletons, segmentation maps, depth, normals, etc.)\nare often treated as conditioning on the image generation\nprocess. Image-to-image translation models [ 34,98] learnarXiv:2302.05543v3  [cs.CV]  26 Nov 2023the mapping from conditioning images to target images. The\nresearch community has also taken steps to control text-\nto-image models with spatial masks [ 6,20], image editing\ninstructions [ 10], personalization via finetuning [ 21,75],etc.\nWhile a few problems ( e.g., generating image variations,\ninpainting) can be resolved with training-free techniques\nlike constraining the denoising diffusion process or edit-\ning attention layer activations, a wider variety of problems\nlike depth-to-image, pose-to-image, etc., require end-to-end\nlearning and data-driven solutions.\nLearning conditional controls for large text-to-image dif-\nfusion models in an end-to-end way is challenging. The\namount of training data for a specific condition may be sig-\nnificantly smaller than the data available for general text-to-\nimage training. For instance, the largest datasets for various\nspecific problems ( e.g., object shape/normal, human pose\nextraction, etc.) are usually about 100K in size, which is\n50,000 times smaller than the LAION-5B [ 79] dataset that\nwas used to train Stable Diffusion [ 82]. The direct finetun-\ning or continued training of a large pretrained model with\nlimited data may cause overfitting and catastrophic forget-\nting [ 31,75]. Researchers have shown that such forgetting\ncan be alleviated by restricting the number or rank of train-\nable parameters [ 14,25,31,92]. For our problem, designing\ndeeper or more customized neural architectures might be\nnecessary for handling in-the-wild conditioning images with\ncomplex shapes and diverse high-level semantics.\nThis paper presents ControlNet, an end-to-end neural\nnetwork architecture that learns conditional controls for large\npretrained text-to-image diffusion models (Stable Diffusion\nin our implementation). ControlNet preserves the quality\nand capabilities of the large model by locking its parameters,\nand also making a trainable copy of its encoding layers.\nThis architecture treats the large pretrained model as a strong\nbackbone for learning diverse conditional controls. The\ntrainable copy and the original, locked model are connected\nwith zero convolution layers, with weights initialized to zeros\nso that they progressively grow during the training. This\narchitecture ensures that harmful noise is not added to the\ndeep features of the large diffusion model at the beginning\nof training, and protects the large-scale pretrained backbone\nin the trainable copy from being damaged by such noise.\nOur experiments verify that Con-\ntrolNet can effectively control Stable Diffusion with single\nor multiple conditions, with or without prompts.

In this work, we propose the De-\nnoising Diffusion Null-Space Model (DDNM), a novel zero-shot framework for\narbitrary linear IR problems, including but not limited to image super-resolution,\ncolorization, inpainting, compressed sensing, and deblurring.

For some sim-\nple degradation like inpainting, colorization, and SR based on average pooling, the pseudo-inverse\nAycan be constructed manually, which has been discussed in Sec. 3.2.

In 2019 IEEE", "ABSTRACT\nClassi\ufb01er guidance is a recently introduced method to trade off mode coverage\nand sample \ufb01delity in conditional diffusion models post training, in the same spirit\nas low temperature sampling or truncation in other types of generative models.\nClassi\ufb01er guidance combines the score estimate of a diffusion model with the\ngradient of an image classi\ufb01er and thereby requires training an image classi\ufb01er\nseparate from the diffusion model. It also raises the question of whether guidance\ncan be performed without a classi\ufb01er. We show that guidance can be indeed\nperformed by a pure generative model without such a classi\ufb01er: in what we\ncall classi\ufb01er-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional\ndiffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score\nestimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that\nobtained using classi\ufb01er guidance.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nDiffusion models have recently emerged as an expressive and \ufb02exible family of generative models,\ndelivering competitive sample quality and likelihood scores on image and audio synthesis tasks (Sohl-\nDickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021b; Kingma et al., 2021;\nSong et al., 2021a). These models have delivered audio synthesis performance rivaling the quality\nof autoregressive models with substantially fewer inference steps (Chen et al., 2021; Kong et al.,\n2021), and they have delivered ImageNet generationresults showing the effectiveness of classi\ufb01er-free guidance con\ufb01rm that\npure generative diffusion models are capable of maximizing classi\ufb01er-based sample quality metrics\nwhile entirely avoiding classi\ufb01er gradients. We look forward to further explorations of classi\ufb01er-free\nguidance in a wider variety of settings and data modalities.\n7 A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Ben Poole and Mohammad Norouzi for discussions.experiments is to serve as a proof of concept to demonstrate that classi\ufb01er-free\nguidance is able to attain a FID/IS tradeoff similar to classi\ufb01er guidance and to understand the\nbehavior of classi\ufb01er-free guidance, not necessarily to push sample quality metrics to state of the art\n5Figure 3: Classi\ufb01er-free guidance on 128x128 ImageNet.

For this purpose, we use the same model architectures and hyperparameters as\nthe guided diffusion models of Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) (apart from continuous time training as\nspeci\ufb01ed in Section 2); those hyperparameter settings were tuned for classi\ufb01er guidance and hence\nmay be suboptimal for classi\ufb01er-free guidance. Furthermore, since we amortize the conditional and\nunconditional models into the same architecture without an extra classi\ufb01er, we in fact are using less\nmodel capacity than previous work. Nevertheless, our classi\ufb01er-free guided models still produce\ncompetitive sample quality metrics and sometimes outperform prior work, as can be seen in the\nfollowing sections.\n4.1 V ARYING THE CLASSIFIER -FREE GUIDANCE STRENGTH\nHere we experimentally verify the main claim of this paper: that classi\ufb01er-free guidance is able\nto trade off IS and FID in a manner like classi\ufb01er guidance or GAN truncation.

Building\nemotional machines: Recognizing image emotions through deep\nneural", " Introduction\nDiffusion models have shown impressive performance both as generative models themselves [ 41,13],\nand also as unsupervised inverse problem solvers [ 22,8,9,25] that do not require problem-specific\ntraining. Specifically, given a pre-trained unconditional score function (i.e. denoiser), solving the\nreverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) numerically would amount to sampling from the data\ngenerating distribution [ 41]. For many different inverse problems (e.g. super-resolution [ 8,9],\ninpainting [ 41,9], compressed-sensing MRI (CS-MRI) [ 40,9], sparse view CT (SV-CT) [ 40], etc.),\nit was shown that simple incorporation of the measurement process produces satisfactory conditional\nsamples, even when the model was not trained for the specific problem.\nNevertheless, for certain problems (e.g. inpainting), currently used algorithms often produce unsat-\nisfactory Appendix. B.\n2.2 Conditional Generative models for Inverse problems\nThe main problem of our interest in this paper is the inverse problem, retrieving the unknown x\u2208Rn\nfrom a measurement y:\ny=Hx+\u03f5,y\u2208Rm,H\u2208Rm\u00d7n, (6)\nwhere \u03f5\u2208Rmis the noise in the measurement. Accordingly, for the case of the inverse problems,\nour goal is to generate samples from a conditional distribution with respect to the measurement\ny, i.e. p(x|y). Accordingly, the score function \u2207xlogpt(x)in(2)should be replaced by the\nconditional score \u2207xlogpt(x|y). Unfortunately, this strictly restricts the generalization capability\nof the neural network since the conditional score should be retrained whenever the conditions change.\nTo address this, recent conditional diffusion models [ 22,41,8,9] utilize the unconditional score\nfunction \u2207xlogpt(x)but rely on a projection-based measurement constraint to impose the conditions.\nSpecifically, one can apply the following:\nx\u2032\ni\u22121=f(xi, s\u03b8) +g(xi)z,z\u223c N(0,I), (7)\nxi\u22121=Ax\u2032\ni\u22121+bi, (8)\nwhere A,biare functions of H,y,andx0. Note that (7)is identical to the unconditional reverse\ndiffusion step in (5), whereas (8)effectively imposes the condition. Using the projection approach\non Tweedie denoised estimates was proposed in [ 22]. Also, it was shown in [ 9] that any general\ncontraction mapping (e.g. projection onto convex sets, gradient step) may be utilized as (8)to impose\nthe constraint.\nAnother recent work [ 25] advancing [ 26] establishes the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in solving noisy\ninverse problems with unconditional diffusion models, by running the conditional reverse diffusion\nprocess in the spectral domain achieved by performing singular value decomposition (SVD), and\nleveraging approximate gradient of the log likelihood term in the spectral space. The authors show\nthat feasible solutions can be obtained with as small as 20 diffusion steps.\nPrior to the development of diffusion models, Plug-and-Play (PnP) models [ 47,53,44] were used\nin a similar fashion by utilizing a general-purpose unconditional denoiser in the place of proximal\nmappings in model-based iterative reconstruction Experiments\nFor all tasks, we aim to verify the superiority of our method against other diffusion model-based\napproaches, and also against strong supervised learning-based baselines. Further details can be found\nin Section. F.\nDatasets and Implementation For inpainting, we use FFHQ 256 \u00d7256 [ 24], and ImageNet\n256\u00d7256 [ 12] to validate our method. We utilize pre-trained models from the open sourced reposi-\ntory based on the implementation of ADM (VP-SDE) [ 13]. We validate the performance on 1000\nheld-out validation set images for both FFHQ and ImageNet dataset. For the colorization task, we\nuse FFHQ 256 \u00d7256, and LSUN-bedroom 256 \u00d7256 [ 51].

Additionally, lensless cameras offer the\nbenefits of compressed imaging [Fergus et al .2006; Liutkus et al .\n2014], embedding higher dimensional scene information such as\ndepth from a single capture. To benefit from these qualities, experts\ntypically model lensless cameras as a linear system and recover\nimages computationally by solving the inverse problem.\nPseudo-random phase masks have demonstrated adequate perfor-\nmance for lensless photography [Antipa et al .2018; Boominathan\net al.2020]. Unfortunately, image reconstruction typically requires\ncomputationally expensive and slow iterative reconstruction al-\ngorithms (e.g. ADMM [Antipa et al .2018] and FISTA [Beck and\nTeboulle 2009]). To address this, a growing number of works use\ndata-driven Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve the\nspeed and quality of lensless image reconstructions [Bae et al .2020;\nBarbastathis et al .2019; Sinha et al .2017]. A typical CNN with a\nlimited receptive field size fails to accurately model the light trans-\nport of the imaging system [Goodman 2005], leading to learned\nmodels which fail to reconstruct lensless images accurately and\nefficiently. Recent literature proposes neural networks that include\na physical model with a large receptive field [Boominathan et al .\n2020; Monakhova et al .2019]. These neural networks typically use\na single-shot calibration measurement of the Point-Spread Func-\ntion (PSF) to represent the physical model of the imaging system.\nHowever, without the use of precisely engineered masks [Boomi-\nnathan et al .2020; Tseng et al .2021], image formation in lensless\ncameras cannot be fully expressed by a single PSF model [Yanny\net al.2020]. This model mismatch can lead data-driven regulariz-\ners to hallucinate missing features or create overly smooth images.\nTherefore, the development of models that can correct for model\nerror without increased computational complexity or extensive cal-\nibration is of critical importance for the widespread adoption of\nlensless imaging. Our proposed method replaces ADMM with a\nlearned optimization scheme, improving image quality by reducing\nmodel error as opposed to intensive post-processing. The result is a\nversatile deeply-calibrated lensless imaging architecture that avoids\nmodel error in the resulting reconstructions. We provide the experiments with our in-house built camera, we ob-\nserve a lesser quality in image reconstructions when compared\nwith the state of the art datasets [Boominathan et al .2020; Mon-\nakhova et al .2019]. We believe these originate from the fact that the\noff-the-shelf diffuser we use does not fully resemble the case that\nwe draw our inspiration from [Antipa et al .2018]. However, our\nwork significantly improves the image quality both on benchmark\ndatasets [Monakhova et al. 2019] and our in-house built camera.\n2 RELATED WORK\nWe introduce a novel image reconstruction method for lensless\ncameras. Here, we provide a brief survey of prior art in lensless\ncameras, unsupervised lensless image reconstruction Methods and conclusion, existing learned DISCUSSION\nComparison to classical CONCLUSION\nUnconventional camera designs with thin masks in place of con-\nventional lenses offer freedom from the constraints of traditional\noptics. However, the speed of reconstruction and image quality in\nmask-based lensless camera designs remains a significant drawback.\nWe argue that neural networks with", " Introduction\nMany problems in image processing, including super-resolution [ 31,17], deblurring [ 28,48], inpaint-\ning [55], colorization [ 29,58], and compressive sensing [ 1], are instances of linear inverse problems,\nwhere the goal is to recover an image from potentially noisy measurements given through a known\nlinear degradation model. For a speci\ufb01c degradation model, image restoration can be addressed\nthrough end-to-end supervised training of neural networks, using pairs of original and degraded im-\nages [ 14,58,41]. However, real-world applications such as medical imaging often require \ufb02exibility\nto cope with multiple, possibly in\ufb01nite, degradation models [ 46]. Here, unsupervised approaches\nbased on learned priors [ 36], where the degradation model is only known and used during inference,\nmay be more desirable since they can adapt to the given problem without re-training [ 51].

In contrast, the promis-\ning Related Work\nGenerative Models for Image Synthesis The high di-\nmensional nature of images presents distinct challenges\nto generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) [27] allow for ef\ufb01cient sampling of high resolution\nimages with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are dif\ufb01-\n2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full\ndata distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth-\nods emphasize good density estimation which renders op-\ntimization more well-behaved. Variational autoencoders\n(V AE) [46] and \ufb02ow-based models [18, 19] enable ef\ufb01cient\nsynthesis of high resolution images [9, 44, 92], but sam-\nple quality is not on par with GANs. While autoregressive\nmodels (ARM) [6, 10, 94, 95] achieve strong performance\nin density estimation, computationally demanding architec-\ntures [97] and a sequential sampling process limit them to\nlow resolution images. Because pixel based representations\nof images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency de-\ntails [16,73], maximum-likelihood training spends a dispro-\nportionate amount of capacity on modeling them, resulting\nin long training times. To scale to higher resolutions, several\ntwo-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model\na compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels.\nRecently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82],\nhave achieved state-of-the-art methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(zjx) =\nN(z;E\u0016;E\u001b2)and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0;1)as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu-\nlarizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of jZjdifferent exemplars [96].\nTo obtain high-\ufb01delity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the\nKLterm by a factor\u001810\u00006or choose a high codebook dimensionality jZj.\nThe full objective to train the autoencoding model (E;D)reads:\nLAutoencoder = min\nE;Dmax\n \u0010\nLrec(x;D(E(x)))\u0000Ladv(D(E(x))) + logD (x) +Lreg(x;E;D)\u0011\n(25)\nDM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two\ncases when learning p(z)orp(zjy)(Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we sample z=E\u0016(x)+E\u001b(x)\u0001\"=:E(x),\nwhere\"\u0018N(0;1).

These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a\n\ufb01xed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization\ncapability of models to unknown measurement processes.

Our method does not assume a \ufb01xed\nmeasurement process during training, and can thus be \ufb02exibly adapted to different\nmeasurement processes at test time.

Reconstructing CT and MRI images from raw measurements (sinograms\nfor CT and k-spaces for MRI) are well-known inverse problems. Speci\ufb01cally, measurements in\nCT are given by X-ray projections of an object from various directions, and measurements in MRI\nare obtained by inspecting the Fourier spectrum of an object with magnetic \ufb01elds. However, since\nobtaining the full sinogram for CT causes excessive ionizing radiation for patients, and measuring\nthe full k-space of MRI is very time-consuming, it has become important to reduce the number\nof measurements in CT and MRI. In many cases, only partial measurements, such as sparse-view\nsinograms and downsampled k-spaces, are available. Due to this loss of information, the inverse\nproblems in CT and MRI are often ill-posed, making image reconstruction especially challenging.\nWith the rise of machine learning, manymethods, we tune \u0011and\u0015in Eq.

In the deep learning era, many\nIQA approaches [12, 34, 36, 43, 49] have achieved signi\ufb01-\ncant success by leveraging the power of convolutional neu-\nral networks (CNNs). However, the CNN-based IQA mod-\nels are often constrained by the \ufb01xed-size input requirement\nin batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized\nor cropped to a \ufb01xed shape as shown in Figure 1 (b). This\npreprocessing is problematic for IQA because images in the\nwild have varying aspect ratios and resolutions. Resizing\nand cropping can impact image composition or introduce\ndistortions, thus changing the quality of the image.\nTo learn IQA on the full-size image, the existing CNN-\nbased approaches use either adaptive pooling or resizing to\nget a \ufb01xed-size convolutional feature map. MNA-CNN [25]\n1Checkpoints and code are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/google-research/tree/master/musiq\nFigure 1. In CNN-based models (b), images need to be resized or\ncropped to a \ufb01xed shape for batch training. However, such prepro-\ncessing can alter image aspect ratio and composition, thus impact-\ning image quality. Our patch-based MUSIQ model (a) can process\nthe full-size image and extract multi-scale features, which aligns\nwith the human visual system.\nprocesses a single image in each training batch which is not\npractical for training on a large dataset. Hosu et al. [16]\nextracts and stores \ufb01xed-size features of\ufb02ine, which costs\nadditional storage for every augmented image. To keep as-\npect ratio, Chen et al. [7] proposes a dedicated convolu-\ntion to preserve aspect ratio in the convolutional receptive\n\ufb01eld. Its evaluation veri\ufb01es the importance of aspect-ratio-\npreserving (ARP) in the IQA tasks. But it still needs resiz-\ning and smart grouping for effective batch training.\nIn this paper, we propose a patch-based multi-scale im-\nage quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to bypass the CNN con-\nstraints on \ufb01xed input size and predict the quality effectively\non the native resolution image as shown in Figure 1 (a).\nTransformer [38] is \ufb01rst proposed for natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) and has recently been studied for various vi-\nsion tasks [4\u20136, 11]. Among these, the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) [11] splits each image into a sequence of \ufb01xed-size\npatches, encodes each patch as a token, and then appliesarXiv:2108.05997v1  [cs.CV]  12 Aug 2021Transformer to the sequence for image classi\ufb01cation. In\ntheory, such kind of patch-based Transformer models can\nhandle arbitrary numbers of patches (up to memory con-\nstraints), and therefore do not require preprocessing the in-\nput image to a \ufb01xed resolution. This motivates us to apply\nthe patch-based Transformer on the IQA tasks with the full-\nsize images as input.\nAnother aspect for improving IQA models is to imi-\ntate the human visual system which captures an image in\na multi-scale fashion [1]. Previous works [16, 22, 48]\nhave shown the bene\ufb01t of using multi-scale features ex-\ntracted from CNN feature maps at different depths. This\ninspires us to transform the native resolution image into a\nmulti-scale representation, enabling the Transformer\u2019s self-\nattention mechanism to capture information on both \ufb01ne-\ngrained detailed patches and coarse-grained global patches.\nBesides, unlike the convolution operation in CNNs that has\na relatively limited receptive \ufb01eld, self-attention can attend\nto the whole input sequence and it can therefore effectively\ncapture the image quality at different granularities.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to apply the Trans-\nformer on the multi-aspect-ratio multi-scale input. Al-\nthough self-attention accepts arbitrary length", " Introduction\nGenerative models, such as generative adversarial net-\nworks (GAN) [3, 10, 19], normalizing flows [21], and vari-\national autoencoders [42], have shown remarkable quality\nin image generation, and have been applied to numerous\npurposes such as image-to-image translation [7, 11, 31, 32,\n35, 47] and image editing [1, 12, 36].\nThere are mainly two approaches to control generative\nmodels to generate images as desired: one is by designing\nthe conditional generative models for the desired purpose,\nand the other is by leveraging well-performed unconditionalgenerative models.\nThe first approach learns to control by providing the de-\nsired condition in training procedure and has shown remark-\nable performance on various tasks, such as segmentation\nmask conditioned generation [31, 59], style transfer [9, 50],\nand inpainting [23, 52]. The second approach utilizes high-\nquality generative models, such as StyleGAN [19, 20] or\nBigGAN [3]. Shen et al. [36] and H \u00a8ark\u00a8onen et al. [12] ma-\nnipulate semantic attributes of images by analyzing latent\nspace of pre-trained generative models, while Huh et al .\n[16] and Zhu et al. [57] perform image editing by projecting\nimage into the latent space.\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) [14,\n39], an iterative generative model, has shown comparable\nperformance to the state-of-the-art models in unconditional\nimage generation. DDPM learns to model the Markov tran-\nsition from simple distribution to data distribution and gen-\nerates diverse samples through sequential stochastic tran-\nsitions. Samples obtained from the DDPM depend on the\ninitial state of the simple distribution and each transition.\nHowever, it is challenging to control DDPM to generate\nimages with desired semantics, since the stochasticity of\ntransitions generates images with inconsistent high-level se-\nmantics, even from the same initial state.\nIn this work, we propose a learning-free method, itera-\ntive latent variable refinement (ILVR), to condition the gen-\neration process in well-performing unconditional DDPM.\nEach transition in the generation process is refined utilizing\na given reference image. By matching each latent variable,\nILVR ensures the given condition in each transition thus en-\nables sampling from a conditional distribution. Thus, ILVR\ngenerates high-quality images sharing desired semantics.\nWe describe user controllability of our method, which\nenables control on semantic similarity of generated images\nto the refenence. Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 4 show samples sharing\nsemantics ranging from coarse to fine information. Besides,\nreference images can be selected from unseen data domains.\nFrom these properties, we were motivated to leverage un-\nconditional DDPM learned on single data domain to multi-\ndomain image translation; a challenging task where exist-\ning works had to learn on multiple data domains. Further-\nmore, we extend our method to paint-to-image and edit-\ning with scribbles (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). We demonstrate that\nour ILVR enables leveraging a single unconditional DDPM\nmodel on these various tasks without any additional learn-\ning or models. Measuring Fr \u00b4echet Inception Distance (FID)\nand Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), we\nconfirm that our generation method from various downsam-\npling factors provides control over diversity while maintain-\ning visual quality.\nOur paper makes the following contributions:\n\u2022 We propose ILVR, a method of refining each transi-\ntion in the generative process by matching each latentvariable with given reference image.\n\u2022 We investigate several properties that allows user con-\ntrollability on semantic similarity to the reference.\n\u2022 We demonstrate that our ILVR enables leveraging un-\nconditional DDPM in various image generation tasks\nincluding multi-domain image translation, paint-to-\nimage, and editing with scribbles.\n2. Background\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) [14,\n39] is a", " Introduction\nSingle-image super-resolution is the process of generat-\ning a high-resolution image that is consistent with an in-\nput low-resolution image. It falls under the broad family\nof image-to-image translation tasks, including colorization,\nin-painting, and de-blurring. Like many such inverse prob-\nlems, image super-resolution is challenging because multi-\nple output images may be consistent with a single input im-\nage, and the conditional distribution of output images given\nthe input typically does not conform well to simple para-\nmetric distributions, e.g., a multivariate Gaussian. Accord-\ningly, while simple regression-based results in Figure 6, it is interesting to inspect those images that maximize the fool rates for a\ngiven technique, as well as those images that minimize the fool rate. This provides insight into the nature of the problems\nthat models exhibit, as well as cases in which the model outputs are good enough to regularly fool people.\nIn Figure D.1 we display the images with the lowest fool rates generated by PULSE [28] and SR3 for both Task-1 (the\nconditional task), and Task-2, (the unconditional task). In order to be consistent with our human study interface, we show\nthe corresponding low resolution image only for Task-1. Notice that images from PULSE for which the fool rate is low have\nobvious distortions, and the fool rates are lower than 10% for both tasks. For SR3, by comparison, the images with the lowest\nfool rates are still reasonably good, with much higher fool rates of 14% and 19% in Task-1, and 21% and 26% in Task-2.\nFigure D.2 shows images that best fool human subjects. In this case, it is interesting to note that the best fool rates for\nSR3 are 84% and 88%.

We provide details about the display captured setup, the\nqualitative performance of FlatNet-gen-UC on both cropped and full measurements, the variation of performance of the deep networks\nwith respect to the number of parameters, additional detail on the trainable inversion stage, the performance of FlatNet-gen \ufb01netuned\non unconstrained cropped indoor captures and the performance of both FlatNet-sep and FlatNet-gen on scenes containing bright\nobjects.\nIndex Terms \u2014lensless imaging, image reconstruction\n!\n1 D ISPLAY CAPTURE SETUP\nTo capture a display-captured image using FlatCam [1] and\nPhlatCam [2], the image is resized so as to occupy the\nbiggest central square on a 24-inch monitor using bicubic in-\nterpolation. The monitor was placed at appropriate distance\nso that the image occupied the \ufb01eld of view of the cameras.\nFor FlatCam, this was around 1 foot, while for PhlatCam,\nthis was around 16 inches. This setup is \ufb01xed for all image\ncaptures such that the alignment of the monitor pixels to\nthe camera pixels is uniform throughout both training and\ntest. The white balance setting for FlatCam is \ufb01xed to be\nthe white balance setting obtained in the FlatCam\u2019s (i.e.\nPointGrey Flea3) automatic white balance mode when an\nall-white image is displayed on the monitor. The exposure\ntime is set to PointGrey\u2019s automatic mode, and the camera\u2019s\ngain is set to 0dB. For PhlatCam prototype using a Basler\nace camera, the white balance setting was estimated once\nbefore the capture began by capturing a demo picture. The\nexposure was set at 10000 microseconds. Figure 1 shows\nthe setup for FlatCam capture. The setup for PhlatCam is\nsimilar.\n2 Q UALITATIVE COMPARISON FOR UNCALI -\nBRATED PSF C ASE\nIn Section 4.3.2 and 4.4.1 of the main paper, we provided the\nquantitative comparison for FlatNet-gen with Le-ADMM\nand Tikh+U-Net. In this section, we provide the visual re-\nsults for the uncalibrated versions of the same. In particular,\nwe use PSF simulated using the method described in Section\n3.1.2 and use this PSF for learning Le-ADMM, Tikh+U-\nNet and FlatNet-gen. We provide the comparison for both\nfull measurement in Figure 2 and cropped measurement\nin Figure 3. We can see clearly that the performance of\nFlatNet-gen-UC is very close to its calibrated counterpart\ni.e. FlatNet-gen-C. However, this is not the case with Le-\nADMM and Tikh+U-Net.\nFig. 1. The display capture setup for FlatCam. A similar setup was\nused for PhatCam.\n3 E FFECT OF PARAMETERS ON PERFORMANCE OF\nFLATNET-GEN\nIn this section, we investigate how FlatNet-gen compares\nagainst Le-ADMM and Tikh+U-Net in terms of perfor-\nmance for different parameter count. In particular, we train\nFlatNet-gen, Tikh+U-Net and Le-ADMM for different vari-\nants of U-Net, keeping the number of learnable parameters\nconstant in the trainable inversion stage for FlatNet-gen and\nunrolled ADMM block for Le-ADMM. U-Net-N refers to\nthe variant of U-Net for which the number of \ufb01lters in a\nconvolutional block increases from N to 8N and reduces\nback to N. We perform this experiment for N = 32, 64 and\n128. Table 1 provides the variation of the average PSNR and\nLPIPS for Tikh+U-Net, Le-ADMM and FlatNet-gen against\nthe total number of learnable parameters. It is clear that\nFlatNet-gen outperforms both Tikh+U-Net and Le-ADMM\nfor different parameter counts at the cost of slight increase\nin the relative number of learnable parameters. In the main\ntext, we report the best model for each approach i.e. with\nU-Net-128.arXiv:2010.15440v1  [eess.IV]", " Introduction\nMiniature wide \ufb01eld\ufb02uorescence microscopes enable\nimportant applications in systems biology, for example, the\noptical recording of neural activity in freely moving ani-\nmals1\u20134and long-term in situ imaging within incubators\nand lab-on-a-chip devices. These miniature microscopes,commonly called \u201cMiniscopes, \u201dare developed by a vibrant\nopen-source community\n5and made of 3D-printed parts\nand off-the-shelf components. Although the Miniscope isdesigned for 2D \ufb02uorescence imaging only, many appli-\ncations can bene \ufb01t from imaging 3D structures.\nVolumetric microscopy methods, as discussedin the next section.\nPhase mask optimization using matrix coherence\nGiven the \ufb01rst-principles guidance in the above sec-\ntions, we set the number of microlenses, their character-istic aperture size and their focal length distribution; next,we aim to optimize the microlens positions and aberra-tions to maximize the performance. To make the opti-mization computationally feasible, we ignore the \ufb01eld-\nvarying changes in the PSF and assume that the system isshift invariant for the purposes of design.\nTo optimize the microlens parameters, \u03b8, in terms of\nthe on-axis PSFs at each depth, we set up a loss functionto be optimized that consists of two terms. The \ufb01rst term,Fig. 6 Phase mask parameterized by the point-wise maximum of\nconvex spheres. Each sphere is outlined by a dashed line, and the\n\ufb01nal optic is shaded blue (not to scale)Yanny et al. Light: Science & Applications           (2020) 9:171 Page 10 of 13a cross-coherence loss, promotes good axial resolution by\nensuring that the PSFs at different depths are as dissimilaras possible. Cross-coherence between any two depths is\nde\ufb01ned as kh\u00f0u;v;z\nn\u00de?h\u00f0u;v;zm\u00dek1:\u00bcmaxh\u00f0u;v;zn\u00de? \u00bd\nh\u00f0u;v;zm\u00de/C138, where \u22c6represents the 2D correlation and\nmax [\u00b7] is the element-wise maximum. Intuitively, wewant the cross-coherence to be small, as it represents theworst-case ambiguity that would arise by placing twopoint sources adversarially at depths spaced according tothe separation of their PSF cross-correlation peaks. Bycomputing this quantity for all pairs of z-depths, we can\nproduce a differentiable \ufb01gure-of-merit that optimizes the\nmatrix coherence\n24between depths. In practice, rather\nthan optimizing the cross-coherence, we smoothlyapproximate the max\n33using xkk1/C25\u03c3lnPexp\u00f0x2=\u03c3\u00de.\nHere, \u03c3> 0 is a tuning parameter that trades off the\naccuracy of the approximation with the smoothness. Forour purposes, this has the advantage of penalizing all largecross-correlation values, not just the single largest. We\ndenote this /C1kk\n1.\nThe total cross-coherence loss is then:\nq\u00f0\u03b8\u00de\u00bcX\nnX\nm>nh\u00f0u;v;\u03b8;zn\u00de?h\u00f0u;v;\u03b8;zm\u00de kk1\n\u00f012\u00de\nThe second term in the optimization ensures that the\nlateral resolution is maintained. To do so, we optimize theautocorrelation of the PSF at each depth using the fre-quency domain least-squares method. The analysis in the\u201cLateral Resolution \u201dsection above applies only to a single\nmicrolens; building a phase mask of multiple lenses gen-\nerally degrades resolution by introducing dips in thespectrum that reduce contrast at certain spatial fre-quencies. Hence, we treat the single-lens case as an upperlimit that de \ufb01nes the bandlimit of the multi-lens PSF. To\nreduce the spectral ripple, we penalize the \u2018\n2distance\nbetween the MTFs of the PSF and a diffraction-limitedsingle microlens, | H|. We include a weighting term,\ndenoted as D, that ignores spatial frequencies beyond the\nbandlimit, as well as low spatial frequencies that are lesscritical and dif \ufb01cult to optimize owing to out-of-focus\nmicrolenses.

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse\nimplication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational\ninference to train a Langevin-like sampler.

Despite\nthis, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such\nas PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail\nto account for many nuances of human perception. Re-\ncently, the deep learning community has found that features\nof the VGG network trained on ImageNet classi\ufb01cation has\nbeen remarkably useful as a training loss for image syn-\nthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \u201cpercep-\ntual losses\u201d? What elements are critical for their success?\nTo answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of\nhuman perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically\nevaluate deep features across different architectures and\ntasks and compare them with classic metrics. We \ufb01nd that\ndeep features outperform all previous metrics by large mar-\ngins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not re-\nstricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across\ndifferent deep architectures and levels of supervision (su-\npervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our re-\nsults suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent prop-\nerty shared across deep visual representations.\n1. Motivation\nThe ability to compare data items is perhaps the most\nfundamental operation underlying all of computing. Inmany areas of computer science it does not pose much dif-\n\ufb01culty: one can use Hamming distance to compare binary\npatterns, edit distance to compare text \ufb01les, Euclidean dis-\ntance to compare vectors, etc. The unique challenge of com-\nputer vision is that even this seemingly simple task of com-\nparing visual patterns remains a wide-open problem. Not\nonly are visual patterns very high-dimensional and highly\ncorrelated, but, the very notion of visual similarity is often\nsubjective, aiming to mimic human visual perception. For\ninstance, in image compression, the goal is for the com-\npressed image to be indistinguishable from the original by\na human observer, irrespective of the fact that their pixel\nrepresentations might be very different.\nClassic per-pixel measures, such as `2Euclidean dis-\ntance, commonly used for regression problems, or the re-\nlated Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), are insuf\ufb01cient\nfor assessing structured outputs such as images, as they as-\nsume pixel-wise independence. A well-known example is\nthat blurring causes large perceptual but small `2change.\nWhat we would really like is a \u201cperceptual distance,\u201d\nwhich measures how similar are two images in a way\nthat coincides with human judgment. This problem has\nbeen a longstanding goal, and there have been numerous\nperceptually motivated distance metrics proposed, such as\nSSIM [58], MSSIM [60], FSIM [62], and HDR-VDP [34].\nHowever, constructing a perceptual metric is challeng-\ning, because human judgments of similarity (1) depend on\nhigh-order image structure [58], (2) are context-dependent\n1arXiv:1801.03924v2  [cs.CV]  10 Apr 2018OriginalPerturbed Patches\n(a)Traditional\nOriginalPerturbed Patches (b)CNN-based\nFigure 2: Example distortions.

Scanning and multi-shot methods for imaging through\nscattering [ 20\u201322]. These works have similar mathematical mod-\nels to our system, but instead of trying to mitigate the effects\nof unwanted scattering, here we use the diffuser as an optical\nelement in our system design. Therefore, we choose a thin, opti-\ncally smooth diffuser that refracts pseudorandomly (as opposed\nto true random scattering). Such diffusers have been shown to\nproduce high contrast patterns under incoherent illumination,\nenabling light \ufb01eld imaging [ 23], and have also been used to\nrecord coherent holograms [ 10,24]. Multiple scattering with\ncoherent illumination has been demonstrated as an encoding\nmechanism for 2D compressed sensing [ 25], but necessitates aninef\ufb01cient transmission matrix calibration approach, limiting re-\nconstructions to a few thousand pixels. We achieve similar bene-\n\ufb01ts without needing coherent illumination, and, unlike previous\nwork, we use compressed sensing to add depth information.\nFinally, our system is designed to enable simpler calibration and\nmore ef\ufb01cient computation, allowing for 3D reconstruction at\nmegavoxel scales with superior image quality.\nA. System Overview\nDiffuserCam is part of the class of mask-based lensless imagers\nin which a phase or amplitude mask is placed a small distance\nin front of a sensor, with no main lens. Our mask (the diffuser)\nis a thin transparent phase object with smoothly varying thick-\nness (see Fig. 1). When illuminated by an incoherent source\nsuf\ufb01ciently far from the sensor, the convex bumps concentrate\nlight into high-frequency pseudorandom caustic patterns which\nare captured by the sensor. The caustic patterns, termed Point\nSpread Functions (PSFs), vary with the 3D position of the source,\nthereby capturing 3D information.\nTo illustrate how the caustics encode 3D information, Fig. 2\nshows simulations of caustic PSFs as a function of point source\nlocation in object space. A lateral shift of the point source causes\na lateral translation of the PSF. An axial shift of the point source\ncauses (approximately) a scaling of the PSF. Hence, each 3D\nposition in the volume generates a unique PSF. The resolution\nof our camera depends on the structure and spatial frequencies\npresent in the caustic patterns. Because the caustics retain high\nspatial frequencies over a large range of depths, DiffuserCam\nattains good lateral resolution for objects at any depth within\nthe volumetric \ufb01eld-of-view (FoV).\nBy assuming that all points in the scene are incoherent with\neach other, the measurement can be modeled as a linear combi-\nnation of PSFs from different 3D positions. We represent this as\nmatrix-vector multiplication:\nb=Hv, (1)\nwhere bis a vector representing the 2D sensor measurement\nand vis a vector representing the intensity of the object at every\npoint in the 3D FoV , sampled on a user-chosen grid (discussed in\nSection 3).

While convolutional networks\nhave already existed for a long time [8], their success was limited due to the\nsize of the available training sets and the size of the considered networks. The\nbreakthrough by Krizhevsky et al. [7] was due to supervised training of a large\nnetwork with 8 layers and millions of parameters on the ImageNet dataset with\n1 million training images. Since then, even larger and deeper networks have been\ntrained [12].\nThe typical use of convolutional networks is on classi\fcation tasks, where\nthe output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks,\nespecially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include\nlocalization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. More-\nover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks.\nHence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict\nthe class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixelarXiv:1505.04597v1  [cs.CV]  18 May 20152\ncopy and cropinput\nimage\ntileoutput \nsegmentation \nmap641\n128\n256\n512\n1024max pool 2x2\nup-conv 2x2conv 3x3, ReLU572 x 572\n284\u00b264\n128\n256\n512570 x 570\n568 x 568\n282\u00b2\n280\u00b2140\u00b2\n138\u00b2\n136\u00b268\u00b2\n66\u00b2\n64\u00b232\u00b2\n28\u00b256\u00b2\n54\u00b2\n52\u00b2512\n104\u00b2\n102\u00b2\n100\u00b2200\u00b230\u00b2\n198\u00b2\n196\u00b2392 x 392\n390 x 390\n388 x 388\n388 x 388\n102451225625612864128642\nconv 1x1\nFig. 1.

Secondly, the training data in terms\nof patches is much larger than the number of training images. The resulting\nnetwork won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin.\nObviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [1] has two drawbacks. First, it\nis quite slow because the network must be run separately for each patch, and\nthere is a lot of redundancy due to overlapping patches. Secondly, there is a\ntrade-o\u000b between localization accuracy and the use of context. Larger patches\nrequire more max-pooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy, while\nsmall patches allow the network to see only little context. More recent approaches\n[11,4] proposed a classi\fer output that takes into account the features from\nmultiple layers. Good localization and the use of context are possible at the\nsame time.\nIn this paper, we build upon a more elegant architecture, the so-called \\fully\nconvolutional network\" [9]. We modify and extend this architecture such that it\nworks with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations; see\nFigure 1. The main idea in [9] is to supplement a usual contracting network by\nsuccessive layers, where pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators.\nHence, these layers increase the resolution of the output. In order to localize, high\nresolution features from the contracting path are combined with the upsampled3\nFig. 2.

By addressing this question, we can advance knowledge in the field of robotics and machine learning, leading to more robust and adaptable navigation systems. The implications extend to practical applications in various domains, such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotic assistants, enhancing their ability to operate in diverse and complex environments.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in solving this problem include the need for accurate path generation that avoids obstacles while considering the dynamic nature of environments. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of real-world scenarios, where obstacles can vary significantly in appearance and distribution. Additionally, the technical obstacles involve effectively conditioning the diffusion model on both sensor observations and obstacle maps, which requires sophisticated modeling of the interactions between these elements in the SE(2) space.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on either localization or path planning separately, leading to a lack of integrated solutions that address both tasks simultaneously. Existing methods may not generalize well to different environments due to their reliance on specific training data. Barriers such as limited understanding of diffusion processes in higher-dimensional spaces and the complexity of conditioning techniques have hindered progress. Our approach improves upon prior work by leveraging diffusion models specifically designed for SE(2) and introducing novel conditioning techniques that enhance generalization to arbitrary maps.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves implementing a diffusion model that generates collision-free paths in SE(2) based on egocentric LIDAR scans and arbitrary maps. We will use a dataset of varied 2D environments to train our model, employing metrics such as path accuracy and collision rates to evaluate performance. The expected outcomes include the successful generation of obstacle-free trajectories, improved global localization capabilities, and the demonstration of our model's effectiveness in closed-loop control scenarios within realistic environments.", "proposal_5q": "[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can a hybrid navigation framework that integrates diffusion models with reinforcement learning enhance trajectory generation for robotic navigation in dynamic environments?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem is critical for advancing the field of robotic navigation, particularly in environments that are unpredictable and subject to constant change. The integration of diffusion models allows for the generation of collision-free paths that are adaptable to various vehicle dynamics, while reinforcement learning provides a mechanism for robots to learn from their experiences, improving their efficiency and adaptability. This research could lead to significant advancements in autonomous systems, enabling them to operate successfully in complex scenarios such as search and rescue missions, autonomous vehicles in urban settings, or robotic delivery systems. The broader implications involve enhancing the safety and reliability of robots, ultimately fostering greater trust in their deployment across diverse applications.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the need to balance multiple objectives: generating efficient, collision-free trajectories while accommodating the diverse dynamics of different robotic platforms. Traditional motion planning approaches may fail in dynamic environments due to their static nature and inability to adapt in real-time. The complexities arise from the need for real-time feedback integration, where the robot must continuously assess and adjust its trajectory based on environmental changes. Additionally, the hybridization of diffusion models with reinforcement learning introduces technical challenges in ensuring that the learning process does not compromise the robot\u2019s ability to generate safe paths. Achieving this balance requires sophisticated algorithms that can process vast amounts of data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either reinforcement learning or traditional motion planning techniques, often neglecting the potential synergies between these approaches. Existing solutions, such as the TD3-DWA algorithm, have made strides in collision-free navigation; however, they typically do not leverage the adaptability of reinforcement learning in dynamically changing environments. Additionally, limitations in computational resources and the complexity of implementing hybrid systems have posed significant barriers. My approach differs by explicitly combining the strengths of diffusion models and reinforcement learning, allowing for a more comprehensive navigation strategy that can adaptively refine motion planning based on real-time feedback and historical data.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid navigation framework that utilizes diffusion models for trajectory generation and reinforcement learning for adaptive learning. The framework will be tested using a simulated dataset that includes various dynamic environments with static and moving obstacles. Key metrics for evaluation will include trajectory efficiency, collision avoidance rates, and adaptability scores based on the robot's ability to adjust its path in real-time. Expected outcomes include the development of a robust system that not only generates safe and efficient paths but also demonstrates improved learning capabilities and adaptability, leading to enhanced performance in complex navigation scenarios.

The value of path lis defined as function of the\napproximate length of the estimated trajectory, i.e. for start\nand goal positions being further apart, the path lwill be\nlarger and vice-versa.

The reverse chain of the\nDDPM model is used to iteratively denoise the input vector.\nThe output is the final trajectory A0, connecting the start\nand goal points, while aiming to follow a feasible path.

In practice however, the unique\nnature of predicting robot actions \u2014 such as the existence\nof multimodal distributions, sequential correlation, and the\nrequirement of high precision \u2014 makes this task distinct and\nchallenging compared to other supervised learning problems.\nPrior work attempts to address this challenge by\nexploring different action representations (Fig 1 a) \u2013 using\nmixtures of Gaussians Mandlekar et al. (2021), categorical\nrepresentations of quantized actions Shafiullah et al. (2022),\nor by switching the the policy representation (Fig 1 b) \u2013 from\nexplicit to implicit to better capture multi-modal distributions\nFlorence et al. (2021); Wu et al. (2020).\nIn this work, we seek to address this challenge by\nintroducing a new form of robot visuomotor policy thatgenerates behavior via a \u201cconditional denoising diffusion\nprocess Ho et al. (2020) on robot action space\u201d, Diffusion\nPolicy . In this formulation, instead of directly outputting\nan action, the policy infers the action-score gradient,\nconditioned on visual observations, for Kdenoising\niterations (Fig. 1 c). This formulation allows robot policies\nto inherit several key properties from diffusion models \u2013\nsignificantly improving performance.\n\u2022Expressing multimodal action distributions. By\nlearning the gradient of the action score function\nSong and Ermon (2019) and performing Stochastic\nLangevin Dynamics sampling on this gradient field,\nDiffusion policy can express arbitrary normalizable\ndistributions Neal et al.

Let us consider the pick-\nand-place task in Fig. 1, for which the motion optimization\nshould consider the possible set of grasping and placing\nposes, the trajectories\u2019 smoothness, collision avoidance with\nthe environment, and the robot\u2019s joint limits. While some\nobjectives are easy to model (e.g., joint limits, smoothness),\n\u0003Authors contributed equally.\nThis work received funding by the DFG Emmy Noether Programme (CH\n2676/1-1), by the AICO grant by the Nexplore/Hochtief Collaboration with\nTU Darmstadt, and the EU project ShareWork.\n1Technische Universit \u00a8at Darmstadt (Germany),2German Research\nCenter for AI (DFKI),3Hessian.AI,4Centre for Cognitive\nScience fjulen.urain, niklas.funk, jan.peters,\ngeorgia.chalvatzaki g@tu-darmstadt.deothers (e.g., collision avoidance, grasp pose selection) are\nmore expensive to model and are therefore commonly ap-\nproximated by learning-based approaches [4]\u2013[8].\nData-driven models are usually integrated into motion\noptimization either as sampling functions (explicit genera-\ntors) [6], [9], or cost functions (scalar \ufb01elds) [4], [10]. When\nfacing multi-objective optimization scenarios, the explicit\ngenerators do not allow a direct composition with other\nobjectives, requiring two or even more separate phases during\noptimization [11]. Looking back at the example of Fig. 1, a\ncommon practice is to learn a grasp generator as an explicit\nmodel, sample top-k grasps, and then \ufb01nd the trajectory\nthat, initialized by a grasp candidate, solves the task with\na minimum cost. Given the grasp sampling is decoupled\nfrom the trajectory planning, it might happen the sampled\ngrasps to be unfeasible for the problem, leading to an un-\nsolvable trajectory optimization problem. On the other hand,\nlearned scalar \ufb01elds represent task-speci\ufb01c costs that can\nbe combined with other learned or heuristic cost functions\nto form a single objective function for a joint optimization\nprocess. However, these cost functions are often learned\nthrough cross-entropy optimization [6], [12] or contrastive\ndivergence [10], [13], creating hard discriminative regions\nin the learned model that lead to large plateaus in the\nlearned \ufb01eld with zero or noisy slope regions [14], [15],\nthereby making them unsuitable for pure gradient-based\noptimization. Thus, it is a common strategy to rely on task-\nspeci\ufb01c samplers that \ufb01rst generate samples close to low-cost\nregions before optimizing [6], [12].\nIn this work, we propose learning smooth data-driven cost\nfunctions, drawing inspiration from state-of-the-art diffusion\ngenerative models [16]\u2013[20]. By smoothness , we refer to the\ncost function exposing informative gradients in the entire\nspace. We propose learning these smooth cost functions\nin the SE(3) robot\u2019s workspace, thus de\ufb01ning task-speci\ufb01c\nSE(3) cost functions. In particular, in this work, we show\nhow to learn diffusion models for 6DoF grasping, leveraging\nopen-source vastly annotated 6DoF grasp pose datasets like\nAcronym [21]. SE(3) diffusion models allow moving initiallyarXiv:2209.03855v4  [cs.RO]  18 Jun 2023random samples to low-cost regions (regions of good grasp-\ning poses on objects) by evolving a gradient-based inverse\ndiffusion process [22] (cf. Fig. 2). SE(3) diffusion models\ncome with two bene\ufb01ts. First, we get smooth cost functions\nin SE(3) that can be directly used in motion optimization.\nSecond, they better cover and represent multimodal distri-\nbutions, like in a 6DoF grasp generation scenario, leading\nto better and more sample ef\ufb01cient performance of the\nsubsequent robot planning.\nConsequently, we propose a joint grasp and motion opti-\nmization framework using the learned 6DoF grasp diffusion\nmodel as cost function and combining it with other differ-\nentiable costs (trajectory", " introduction .

Its appeal comes from employing learning\ntechniques only where they are the most mature and\neffective: for the approximation of unknown environment\ndynamics in what amounts to a supervised learning problem.\nAfterwards, the learned model may be plugged into classical\ntrajectory optimization routines (Tassa et al., 2012; Posa\net al., 2014; Kelly, 2017), which are similarly well-\nunderstood in their original context.\n*Equal contribution1University of California, Berkeley2MIT.\nCorrespondence to: janner@berkeley.edu, yilundu@mit.edu.\nProceedings of the 39thInternational Conference on Machine\nLearning , Baltimore, Maryland, USA, PMLR 162, 2022.\nCopyright 2022 by the author(s).\np\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci)\nq(\u001cij\u001ci\u00001)denoising\ndiffusion\nFigure 1. Diffuser is a diffusion probabilistic model that plans by\niteratively re\ufb01ning trajectories.\nHowever, this combination rarely works as described.\nBecause powerful trajectory optimizers exploit learned\nmodels, plans generated by this procedure often look more\nlike adversarial examples than optimal trajectories (Talvitie,\n2014; Ke et al., 2018). As a result, contemporary model-\nbased reinforcement learning algorithms often inherit more\nfrom model-free Background\nOur approach to planning is a learning-based analogue\nof past work in behavioral synthesis using trajectory\noptimization (Witkin & Kass, 1988; Tassa et al., 2012). In\nthis section, we provide a brief background on the problem\nsetting considered by trajectory optimization and the class\nof generative models we employ for that problem.\n2.1 Problem Setting\nConsider a system governed by the discrete-time dynamics\nst+1=f(st;at)at state stgiven an action at. Trajectory\noptimization refers to \ufb01nding a sequence of actions a\u0003\n0:T\nthat maximizes (or minimizes) an objective Jfactorized\nover per-timestep rewards (or costs) r(st;at):\na\u0003\n0:T= arg max\na0:TJ(s0;a0:T) = arg max\na0:TTX\nt=0r(st;at)\nwhereTis the planning horizon. We use the abbreviation\n\u001c= (s0;a0;s1;a1;:::;sT;aT)to refer to a trajectory\nof interleaved states and actions and J(\u001c)to denote the\nobjective value of that trajectory.\n2.2 Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nDiffusion probabilistic models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015;\nHo et al., 2020) pose the data-generating process as an\niterative denoising procedure p\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci). This denoising\nis the reverse of a forward diffusion process q(\u001cij\u001ci\u00001)\nthat slowly corrupts the structure in data by adding noise.\nThe data distribution induced by the model is given by:\np\u0012(\u001c0) =Z\np(\u001cN)NY\ni=1p\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci)d\u001c1:N\nwherep(\u001cN)is a standard Gaussian prior and \u001c0denotes\n(noiseless) data. Parameters \u0012are optimized by minimizingPlanning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis\na variational bound on the negative log likelihood of the\nreverse process: \u0012\u0003= arg min\u0012\u0000E\u001c0\u0002\nlogp\u0012(\u001c0)\u0003\n:The\nreverse process is often parameterized as Gaussian with\n\ufb01xed timestep-dependent covariances:\np\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci) =N(\u001ci\u00001j\u0016\u0012(\u001ci;i);\u0006i):\nThe forward process q(\u001cij\u001ci\u00001)is typically prespeci\ufb01ed.\nNotation. There are two \u201ctimes\u201d at play in this work: that\nof the diffusion process and that of the planning problem.\nWe use superscripts ( iwhen unspeci\ufb01ed) to denote diffusion\ntimestep and subscripts ( twhen unspeci\ufb01ed) to denote\nplanning timestep. For example, s0\ntrefers to thetthstate in a\nnoiseless trajectory. When it is unambiguous from context,\nsuperscripts of noiseless quantities are omitted: \u001c=\u001c0.\nWe overload notation slightly by referring to the tthstate (or\naction) in a trajectory \u001cas\u001cst(or\u001cat).\n3 Planning with Diffusion\nA major obstacle to using trajectory optimization techniques\nis that they require knowledge of the environment dynamics\nf.

While LiDAR sensors provide reliably\naccurate information, existing end-to-end driving solutions are\nmainly based on cameras since processing 3D data requires a\nlarge memory footprint and computation cost. On the other\nhand, increasing the robustness of these systems is also critical;\nhowever, even estimating the model\u2019s uncertainty is very chal-\nlenging due to the cost of sampling-basedmethods can be integrated into an end-to-end learning system\nto execute uncertainty-aware control.\nIII. M ETHODOLOGY\nTraditional end-to-end models perform \u201creactive\u201d control\nfor instantaneous execution. By training the model to addition-\nally predict control commands at steps into the future, we can\nensemble and fuse these predictions once the robot reaches\nthose points, thereby stabilizing control. This paper takes this\nidea even further and intelligently fuses the control predictions\naccording to the model\u2019s uncertainty at each point, in order to\ndeal with sudden unexpected events or an ambiguous future\nenvironment ( i.e., highly uncertain events).\nGiven a raw LiDAR point cloud IL, and a rendered bird\u2019s-\neye view image of the noisy, routed roadmap IM, our objective\nis to learn an end-to-end neural network f\u0012to directly predict\nthe control signals that can drive the vehicle as well as the\ncorresponding epistemic (model) uncertainty.\nf(xk;ek)gK\u00001\nk=0=f\u0012(IL;IM); (1)\nwhere the network outputs Kpredictions, each pair of xk\nandekcorresponding to a control predictions with future\nlookahead distance of k[m] from the current frame: xkis\nthe predicted control value (which can be supervised by the\nrecorded human control yk), and ekare the hyperparameters\nto estimate the uncertainty of this prediction.

However, the remaining xk\u2019s withk > 0might\nalso be used to improve the robustness of the model with\nuncertainty-weighted temporal fusion (using ek\u2019s); learning\nthese additional xk\u2019s also provides the model with a sense\nof planning and predicting the future.\nWe illustrate an ef\ufb01cient and robust LiDAR-only end-to-\nend neural network in Figure 2.

These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text\nprompts [ 72,50] or learning useful feature representations [ 14,7]. While these models are already\n\u0003Equal contributionarXiv:2105.05233v4  [cs.LG]  1 Jun 2021capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond\nthe current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic\ndesign, games, music production, and countless other \ufb01elds.\nGANs [ 19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [ 5,68,28] as measured\nby sample quality metrics such as FID [ 23], Inception Score [ 54] and Precision [ 32]. However, some\nof these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity\nthan state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [ 51,43,42]. Furthermore, GANs are often dif\ufb01cult to\ntrain, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4].\nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them dif\ufb01cult to scale and apply to\nnew domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with\nlikelihood-based models [ 51,25,42,9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically\neasier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore,\nexcept for V AEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time.\nDiffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models which have recently been shown to produce\nhigh-quality images [ 56,59,25] while offering desirable properties such as distribution coverage,\na stationary training objective, and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually\nremoving noise from a signal, and their training objective can be expressed as a reweighted variational\nlower-bound [ 25]. This class of models already holds the state-of-the-art [ 60] on CIFAR-10 [ 31], but\nstill lags behind GANs on dif\ufb01cult generation datasets like LSUN and ImageNet. Nichol and Dhariwal\n[43] found that these models improve reliably with increased compute, and can produce high-quality\nsamples even on the dif\ufb01cult ImageNet 256 \u0002256 dataset using an upsampling stack. However, the\nFID of this model is still not competitive with BigGAN-deep [5], the current state-of-the-art on this\ndataset.\nWe hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors:\n\ufb01rst, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and\nre\ufb01ned; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for \ufb01delity, producing high quality samples\nbut not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these bene\ufb01ts to diffusion models, \ufb01rst by\nimproving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for \ufb01delity.\nWith these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different\nmetrics and datasets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion\nmodels based on Ho et al. [ 25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [ 43] and Song\net al.

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse\nimplication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational\ninference to train a Langevin-like sampler.

Some have\nargued that for arti\ufb01cial agents to learn this complex, struc-\ntured process, it is necessary to build in aspects of reason-\ning, such as compositionality (Hu et al. 2017; Johnson et\nal. 2017b) or relational computation (Santoro et al. 2017).\nHowever, if a model made from general-purpose compo-\nnents could learn to visually reason, such an architecture\nwould likely be more widely applicable across domains.\nTo understand if such a general-purpose architecture ex-\nists, we take advantage of the recently proposed CLEVR\ndataset (Johnson et al. 2017a) that tests visual reasoning via\nquestion answering. Examples from CLEVR are shown in\nFigure 1. Visual question answering, the general task of ask-\ning questions about images, has its own line of datasets (Ma-\nlinowski and Fritz 2014; Geman et al. 2015; Antol et al.\n2015) which generally focus on asking a diverse set of\nsimpler questions on images, often answerable in a single\nglance. From these datasets, a number of effective, general-\npurpose deep learning models have emerged for visual ques-\ntion answering (Malinowski, Rohrbach, and Fritz 2015;\nYang et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2017). How-\never, tests on CLEVR show that these general deep learning\napproaches struggle to learn structured, multi-step reason-\ning (Johnson et al. 2017a). In particular, these appendix (Fig-\nures 16 to 18). \rand\fvalues take advantage of a sizable\nrange, varying from -15 to 19 and from -9 to 16, respec-\ntively.\rvalues show a sharp peak at 0, showing that FiLM\nlearns to use the question to shut off or signi\ufb01cantly sup-\npress whole feature maps. Simultaneously, FiLM learns to\nupregulate a much more selective set of other feature maps\nwith high magnitude \rvalues. Furthermore, a large frac-\ntion ( 36%) of\rvalues are negative; since our model uses\na ReLU after FiLM, \r < 0can cause a signi\ufb01cantly differ-\nent set of activations to pass the ReLU to downstream layers\nthan\r > 0. Also, 76% of\fvalues are negative, suggest-\ning that FiLM also uses \fto be selective about which acti-\nvations pass the ReLU. We show later that FiLM\u2019s success\nis largely architecture-agnostic, but examining a particular\nmodel gives insight into the in\ufb02uence FiLM learns to exertFigure 6: t-SNE plots of (\r,\f)of the \ufb01rst (left) and last (right) FiLM layers of a 6-FiLM layer Network.

Together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that FiLM\nlearns to selectively upregulate, downregulate, and shut off\nfeature maps based on conditioning information.\nFiLM Parameters t-SNE Plot In Figure 6, we visualize\nFiLM parameter vectors (\r;\f)for 3,000 random valida-\ntion points with t-SNE.

First and\nlast layer FiLM (\r;\f)are grouped by the low-level and\nhigh-level reasoning functions necessary to answer CLEVR\nquestions, respectively. For example, FiLM parameters for\nequal color andquery color are close for the \ufb01rst\nlayer but apart for the last layer. The same is true for shape,\nsize and material questions. Conversely, equal shape ,\nequal size , and equal material FiLM parameters\nare grouped in the last layer but", " Introduction\nDeep convolutional neural networks [22, 21] have led\nto a series of breakthroughs for image classi\ufb01cation [21,\n50, 40]. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high-\nlevel features [50] and classi\ufb01ers in an end-to-end multi-\nlayer fashion, and the \u201clevels\u201d of features can be enriched\nby the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence\n[41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance,\nand the leading results (Table 14), showing a 64%\nrelative reduction of error. This result won the 1st place in\nthe ImageNet localization task in ILSVRC 2015.\n12 experiments trained\non the training set and evaluated on the test set. Our focus\nis on the behaviors of extremely deep networks, but not on\npushing the state-of-the-art Related Work\nResidual Representations. In image recognition, VLAD\n[18] is a representation that encodes by the residual vectors\nwith respect to a dictionary, and Fisher Vector [30] can be\nformulated as a probabilistic version [18] of VLAD. Both\nof them are powerful shallow representations for image re-\ntrieval and classi\ufb01cation [4, 48]. For vector quantization,\nencoding residual vectors [17] is shown to be more effec-\ntive than encoding original vectors.\nIn low-level vision and computer graphics, for solv-\ning Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the widely used\nMultigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subprob-\nlems at multiple scales, where each subproblem is respon-\nsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a \ufb01ner\nscale. An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis pre-\nconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that repre-\nsent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown\n[3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than stan-\ndard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the\nsolutions. These methods.\nports a center-crop error of 33.1% (Table 13) using ground\ntruth classes. Under the same setting, our RPN method us-\ning ResNet-101 net signi\ufb01cantly reduces the center-crop er-\nror to 13.3%. This comparison demonstrates the excellent\nperformance of our framework. With dense (fully convolu-\ntional) and multi-scale testing, our ResNet-101 has an error\nof 11.7% using ground truth classes. Using ResNet-101 for\npredicting classes (4.6% top-5 classi\ufb01cation error, Table 4),\nthe top-5 localization error is 14.4%.\nThe above introduction, if the added layers can\nbe constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should\nhave training error no greater than its shallower counter-\npart. The degradation problem suggests that the solvers\nmight have dif\ufb01culties in approximating identity mappings\nby multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning re-\nformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers\nmay simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear lay-\ners toward zero to approach identity mappings.\nIn real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are op-\ntimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the\nproblem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity\nmapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the\nsolver to \ufb01nd the perturbations with reference to an identity\nmapping, than to learn the function as a new one. We show\nby Experiments\n4.1. ImageNet Classi\ufb01cation\nWe evaluate our method on the ImageNet 2012 classi\ufb01-\ncation dataset [36] that consists of 1000 classes.

While convolutional networks\nhave already existed for a long time [8], their success was limited due to the\nsize of the available training sets and the size of the considered networks. The\nbreakthrough by Krizhevsky et al. [7] was due to supervised training of a large\nnetwork with 8 layers and millions of parameters on the ImageNet dataset with\n1 million training images. Since then, even larger and deeper networks have been\ntrained [12].\nThe typical use of convolutional networks is on classi\fcation tasks, where\nthe output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks,\nespecially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include\nlocalization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. More-\nover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks.\nHence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict\nthe class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixelarXiv:1505.04597v1  [cs.CV]  18 May 20152\ncopy and cropinput\nimage\ntileoutput \nsegmentation \nmap641\n128\n256\n512\n1024max pool 2x2\nup-conv 2x2conv 3x3, ReLU572 x 572\n284\u00b264\n128\n256\n512570 x 570\n568 x 568\n282\u00b2\n280\u00b2140\u00b2\n138\u00b2\n136\u00b268\u00b2\n66\u00b2\n64\u00b232\u00b2\n28\u00b256\u00b2\n54\u00b2\n52\u00b2512\n104\u00b2\n102\u00b2\n100\u00b2200\u00b230\u00b2\n198\u00b2\n196\u00b2392 x 392\n390 x 390\n388 x 388\n388 x 388\n102451225625612864128642\nconv 1x1\nFig. 1.

Secondly, the training data in terms\nof patches is much larger than the number of training images. The resulting\nnetwork won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin.\nObviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [1] has two drawbacks. First, it\nis quite slow because the network must be run separately for each patch, and\nthere is a lot of redundancy due to overlapping patches. Secondly, there is a\ntrade-o\u000b between localization accuracy and the use of context. Larger patches\nrequire more max-pooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy, while\nsmall patches allow the network to see only little context. More recent approaches\n[11,4] proposed a classi\fer output that takes into account the features from\nmultiple layers. Good localization and the use of context are possible at the\nsame time.\nIn this paper, we build upon a more elegant architecture, the so-called \\fully\nconvolutional network\" [9]. We modify and extend this architecture such that it\nworks with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations; see\nFigure 1. The main idea in [9] is to supplement a usual contracting network by\nsuccessive layers, where pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators.\nHence, these layers increase the resolution of the output. In order to localize, high\nresolution features from the contracting path are combined with the upsampled3\nFig. 2.

By establishing a theoretical framework for the perspective space, future research can build upon this knowledge to enhance model interpretability, improve model selection processes, and facilitate the development of more robust generative models.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3.

To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024).

Whereas the vast literature on multidimensional scaling\n(MDS) is almost entirely concerned with embedding dissimilarity data for a fixed\nnumber of objects, various modern applications are concerned with situations in which\nthe number of objects tends to infinity. For example:\n\u2022Manifold learning studies the recovery of data manifolds. Much of the current\ntheory offers guarantees that hold asymptotically, as the manifold is sampled\nmore and more extensively. If recovery means representation in Euclidean space,\nthen it is natural to inquire how the representations behave asymptotically.\n\u2022Network science frequently studies the behavior of graphs with increasing num-\nbers of vertices. Upon constructing the matrix of pairwise dissimilarities be-\ntween the vertices of a graph, the problem of embedding that graph in Eu-\nclidean space (here referred to as graph embedding , although the same phrase\nhas also been used in other contexts) reduces to the problem of MDS. Again,\nit is natural to inquire how the Euclidean representations of the graphs behave\nasymptotically.\nThe preceding examples coalesce in the manifold learning technique known as\nIsomap [9], the study of which motivated the present inquiry. Isomap posits data\nthat lie on a compact connected Riemannian manifold and consists of three distinct\nsteps: (1) constructing a graph that summarizes the local structure of the data; (2)\ncomputing the shortest path distances between the vertices; and (3) embedding the\nshortest path distances by MDS. Several researchers [1, 10] have studied the conver-\ngence of the shortest path distances to the corresponding Riemannian distances as\nsampling of the manifold increases. Here, we develop tools for examining the asymp-\ntotic behavior of the pairwise Euclidean distances in the embedded configuration.\nThe development that follows assumes that embedding is accomplished by finding\na global minimizer of Kruskal\u2019s [7] raw stress criterion. Similar Discussion\nAlthough we believe that our formulation of continuous MDS in Section 4 is of general\ninterest, the work described herein was motivated by our study of random dot product\ngraphs (RDPGs). See [11] and the appendix.\nWe apply elementary Appendix: Computation\nFixnand \u2206, and consider the unconstrained optimization problem of finding an n\u00d7d\nconfiguration matrix Zthat minimizes (2). A standard approach to unconstrained\noptimization begins with identifying solutions of the stationary equation, i.e., the\nequation that requires all partial derivatives of the objective function to vanish. A\npopular approach to minimizing (2) exploits the special structure of its stationary\nequation.\nLetGdenote an undirected graph with vertices 1 , . . . , n . Ifwij=wji>0, then\nvertices iandjare connected with edge weight wij. Assume that Gis connected, in\n12which case L, the combinatorial Laplacian matrix of G, has exactly one zero eigen-\nvalue with eigenvector e= (1, . . . , 1)\u2208 \u211cn. Next, modify Gby removing any edges\nthat connect identical vertices, i.e., vertices iandjfor which dij=\u2225zi\u2212zj\u2225= 0.\nAssign edge weights of wij\u03b4ij/dijto the remaining edges and let M(Z) denote the\ncombinatorial Laplacian matrix of the modified graph. Then it turns out that the\nstationary equation for minimizing (2) can be written as LZ=M(Z)Z.\nThe equation LZ=M(Z)Zsuggests an iterative method for finding stationary\nconfigurations: given a configuration Zk, solve the linear system LZ=M(Zk)Zkto\nobtain a new configuration Zk+1. Typically, one computes the unique solution that\nsatisfies etZ=\u20d70\u2208 \u211cd, i.e., one requires the configuration Zk+1to", " Introduction\nText embeddings are an integral component of\nmodern NLP applications powering retrieval-\naugmented-generation (RAG) for LLMs and se-\nmantic search (Lewis et al., 2021a; Izacard et al.,\n2022b; Ram et al., 2023).

BERT was the first of a class of models that have come to be\nknown as foundation models, or large models trained in a self-supervised fashion which can be readily\nadapted to downstream tasks. Recently, advances in language model scaling [ 6], prompt design [ 24],\nand modality fusion [ 19] have lead to the rapid and near ubiquitous adoption of foundation models\nacross industry and academia alike [4].\nPrincipled evaluation methodologies for foundation models have not kept pace with this mass\nadoption. In particular, the most extensive attempts to characterize and evaluate large language\nmodels [ 14,17] involve benchmarking their performance on a wide variety of datasets using a set\nof aggregate performance metrics. Unfortunately, this method of model comparison is unsuitable\nin situations where the ideal metric is either not obvious nor unavailable. Further, even when an\nevaluation metric is known, it may provide an incomplete characterization of model performance. For\nexample, comparing models based on aggregate perplexity alone is not sufficient for understanding if\nthey are disproportionately underperformant on a particular subgroup of data [3].\nAn ideal model comparison methodology would surface exactly the set of data that differs between\ntwo models. This would enable practitioners to discover systematic differences between the models\nbeing compared, without having to define a metric which captures those differences a priori. Towards\nthis end, we propose a framework for directly comparing the geometry of the embedding spaces\nlearned by different models on a per-datum basis.

Accordingly, we\ndemonstrate how to extend our framework to enable multi-model comparison by inducing a manifold\nof models. We find that the distance between two models on this manifold is correlated strongly\nwith the similarity of their performance on downstream tasks. In future work, we aim to scale\nour population level comparison methodology to induce an empirical manifold of models. Such a\nmanifold would allow practitioners to frame model evaluation as a taxonomic problem, and generalize\nfindings about the performance of a particular model to the performance of a family of models.\nNotation.

We design a\nTransformer generation algorithm where\na tree search algorithm is used to perform\nlookahead planning. The tree search al-\ngorithm alone may not be able to \ufb01nd\nhigh-quality codes due to the large search\nspace. So the conventional Transformer\nbeam search algorithm and the next-token\nprobabilities provided by the pre-trained\nTransformer are used by the tree search\nalgorithm to guide the search process.\nWe provide the pseudocode of our\nPlanning-Guided Transformer Decoding\nalgorithm (PG-TD) in Algorithm 1 and\nillustrate the whole process in Figure 2.\nThe PG-TD algorithm follows the same\nframework as the standard MCTS algo-\nrithm, based on the implementation used\nin Silver et al. (2017). Here, we focus on\nhow the Transformer is used in the tree\nsearch steps. We provide more details of\nour algorithm in Sec. D.1.\nIn the selection step, we follow Silver et al. (2017) and use the P-UCB algorithm to select which\nbranch of the tree we want to explore. In P-UCB, we weigh the exploration term by the probability of\nthe next tokens determined by the Transformer. So the tree search selects higher-probability tokens\nmore often. The selection algorithm is parameterized by an exploration parameter, c, where a higher\ncvalue leads to more exploration. We describe the details of P-UCB in Sec. D.1.\nIn the expansion step, after a node in the tree is selected, we select the possible next tokens and add\nthe corresponding next states as new nodes to its children list (for succinctness, a node also refers\nto the state that it represents). Sampling a random token as in the standard MCTS may very likely\ncause a syntax error. So we call TOP Kto get the most likely next tokens, where TOP K(s;k)returns\nthekmost likely next tokens starting from s;kis the maximum number of children that any node\nmay have.

We cannot directly evaluate the quality of a partial program as we do not know how it\nwill be completed and how many test cases it will pass.

Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the\nT2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from\nscratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated\nvideos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.)\nof today\u2019s image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to\nbuild on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules. First, we\ndecompose the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximate them\nin space and time. Second, we design a spatial temporal pipeline to generate\nhigh resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model\nand two super resolution models that can enable various applications besides\nT2V . In all aspects, spatial and temporal resolution, faithfulness to text, and\nquality, Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation,\nas determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Internet has fueled collecting billions of (alt-text, image) pairs from HTML pages (Schuhmann\net al., 2022), enabling the recent breakthroughs in Text-to-Image (T2I) modeling. However, repli-\ncating this success for videos is limited since a similarly sized (text, video) dataset cannot be easily\ncollected. It would be wasteful to train Text-to-Video (T2V) models from scratch when there already\nexist models that can generate images. Moreover, unsupervised learning enables networks to learn\nfrom orders of magnitude more data. This large quantity of data is important to learn representa-\ntions of more subtle, less common concepts in the world. Unsupervised learning has long had great\nsuccess in advancing the \ufb01eld of natural language processing (NLP) (Liu et al., 2019a; Brown et al.,\n2020). Models pre-trained this way yield considerably higher performance than when solely trained\nin a supervised manner.\nInspired by these motivations, we propose Make-A-Video. Make-A-Video leverages T2I models\nto learn the correspondence between text and the visual world, and uses unsupervised learning on\nunlabeled (unpaired) video data, to learn realistic motion. Together, Make-A-Video generates videos\nfrom text without leveraging paired text-video data.\nClearly, text describing images does not capture the entirety of phenomena observed in videos. That\nsaid, one can often infer actions and events from static images (e.g. a woman drinking coffee, or an\n+Core Contributors. Corresponding author: urielsinger@meta.com .

Manipulating images in an open domain context was first proposed by the\nseminal Open-Edit [26], which allowed text prompts to alter an image\u2019s content.\nThis was done mostly with semantically simple transformations (e.g., turn a red\napple green), and does not allow generation of images. Soon after DALL-E [41]\nand GLIDE [36] were developed, both of which can perform generation (and\ninpainting) from arbitrary text prompts, but do not themselves enable image\nmanipulation.\nIn this work we propose the first a unified approach to semantic image gener-\nation and editing, leveraging a pretrained joint image-text encoder [40] to steer\nan image generative model [12]. Our methodology works by using the multimodal\nencoder to define a loss function evaluating the similarity of a (text, image) pair\nand backpropagating to the latent space of the image generator. We iteratively\n\u22c6Co-first authorsarXiv:2204.08583v2  [cs.CV]  4 Sep 20222 K Crowson, S Biderman et al.\nupdate the candidate generation until it is sufficiently similar to the target text.\nThe difference between using our technique for generation and editing is merely\na matter of initializing the generator with a particular image (for editing) or\nwith random noise (for generation).\nA significant advantage of our methodology is the lack of additional training\nrequired. Only a pretrained image generator and a joint image-text encoder are\nnecessary, while all three of Liu et al. [26], Ramesh et al. [41], and Nichol et al.\n[36] require training similar models from scratch. Additionally Ramesh et al. [41]\nand Nichol et al. [36] train generators from scratch.\nWe demonstrate several significant contributions, including:\n1. High visual quality for both generation and manipulation of images.\n2. High semantic fidelity between text and generation, especially when seman-\ntically unlikely content co-occurs.\n3. Efficiency in that our method requires no additional training beyond the pre-\ntrained models, using only a small amount of optimization per inference.\n4. The value of open development and research. This technique was developed\nin public and open collaboration has been integral to its rapid real-world\nsuccess. Non-authors have already extended our approach to other modalities\n(e.g., replacing text for audio) and commercial applications.\nThe rest of our manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss\nhow of how our methodology works, resulting in a simple and easy-to-apply\napproach for combing multiple modalities for generation or manipulation. The\nefficacy of vqgan-clip in generating high quality and semantically relevant\nimages is shown in Section 3, followed by superior manipulation ability in Sec-\ntion 4. The design choices of vqgan-clip to obtain both high image quality and\nfast generation are validated by ablations in Section 5, and Section 6 discusses\nresource usage and efficiency considerations. As our approach has been public\nsince April 2021, we are able to show further validation by external groups in\nSection 7. This use includes extensions to other modalities, showing the flexibil-\nity of our approach, as well as commercial use of vqgan-clip that demonstrate\nits success at handling open-domain prompts and images to a satisfying degree.\nFinally we conclude in Section 8.\n2 Our Methodology\nTo demonstrate our method\u2019s effectiveness we apply it using VQGAN [12] and\nCLIP [40] as pre-trained models, and so refer to our approach as vqgan-clip", " Introduction\nSuccessfulnon-invasiveBrain-ComputerInterfaces(BCI)requiresolvingahighdimensional,highfrequencyprediction\nproblem.

For example, the alpha band (8-12 Hz) is known to be\nmore active in stressed individuals and the theta (4-7 Hz) and low beta (13-20 Hz) bands are known to be active in\nfatigued persons.

However, the choice of di\ufb00erent sensors to measure coupling strength is\nhighly subjective and require neurophysiological a priori knowledge.

In generative\nmodels, the information about the input is typically dis-\ntributed over multiple hidden states of the model.

However, learning such a\nrepresentation (or embedding) is necessary for many tasks.\nSystems that search over millions or billions of items re-\nquire each entry to be embedded as a dense representation\nand build an index in advance to save computational costs\nat query time. These embeddings are useful features for\nclassi\ufb01cation tasks and can also enable data visualization\napplications via techniques such as clustering. Embedding\nmodels are explicitly optimized to learn a low dimensional\nrepresentation that captures the semantic meaning of the\ninput (Radford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021; Giorgi et al.,\n2020; Gao et al., 2021; Izacard et al., 2021).arXiv:2201.10005v1  [cs.CL]  24 Jan 2022Text and Code Embeddings by Contrastive Pre-Training\nIn this work, we train embedding models using a con-\ntrastive learning objective with in-batch negatives (Sohn,\n2016; Yih et al., 2011) on unlabeled data. The input is en-\ncoded with a Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017)\nand we leverage naturally occurring paired data to con-\nstruct training data with no explicit labels. Text embedding\nmodels are trained on paired text data where we consider\nneighboring pieces of text on the Internet as positive pairs.\nCode embedding models treat the top-level docstring in a\nfunction along with its implementation as a (text, code)\npair.

In order to control for this effect, we searched for long common substrings\nbetween the input examples (presented in prompted form) for our zero-shot test tasks on one hand,\nand documents in C4 (our model\u2019s pretraining set) on the other hand.\nIn order to do this effectively, we use the suf\ufb01x array method described and implemented in Lee\net al. (2021) to index C4, allowing us to run fast counts of how many times a substring appears in\nthe corpus. To limit the number of queries, we search by partitioning sentences into groups of 16\ntokens and doing an exact match query. This gives us an over-counting on how many length-32 token\noverlaps there are in the corpus. We \ufb02ag examples that produce a match during that procedure, then\nmanually inspect them.\nFor NLI datasets, we separate matches for premises and hypotheses since, the premises tend to be\nsourced from the internet and therefore have a high number of matches.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),", " Introduction\nIn this publication, we present Sentence-BERT\n(SBERT), a modi\ufb01cation of the BERT network us-\ning siamese and triplet networks that is able to\nderive semantically meaningful sentence embed-\ndings2.

BERT uses a cross-encoder: Two\nsentences are passed to the transformer network\nand the target value is predicted. However, this\nsetup is unsuitable for various pair regression tasks\ndue to too many possible combinations. Finding\nin a collection of n= 10 000 sentences the pair\nwith the highest similarity requires with BERT\nn\u0001(n\u00001)=2 = 49 995 000 inference computations.\nOn a modern V100 GPU, this requires about 65\nhours. Similar, \ufb01nding which of the over 40 mil-\nlion existent questions of Quora is the most similar\nfor a new question could be modeled as a pair-wise\ncomparison with BERT, however, answering a sin-\ngle query would require over 50 hours.\nA common method to address clustering and se-\nmantic search is to map each sentence to a vec-\ntor space such that semantically similar sentences\nare close. Researchers have started to input indi-\nvidual sentences into BERT and to derive \ufb01xed-\nsize sentence embeddings. The most commonly\nused approach is to average the BERT output layer\n(known as BERT embeddings) or by using the out-\nput of the \ufb01rst token (the [CLS] token). As we\nwill show, this common practice yields rather bad\nsentence embeddings, often worse than averaging\nGloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014).\nTo alleviate this issue, we developed SBERT.\nThe siamese network architecture enables that\n\ufb01xed-sized vectors for input sentences can be de-\nrived. Using a similarity measure like cosine-\nsimilarity or Manhatten / Euclidean distance, se-\nmantically similar sentences can be found. These\nsimilarity measures can be performed extremely\nef\ufb01cient on modern hardware, allowing SBERT\nto be used for semantic similarity search as well\nas for clustering. The complexity for \ufb01nding thearXiv:1908.10084v1  [cs.CL]  27 Aug 2019most similar sentence pair in a collection of 10,000\nsentences is reduced from 65 hours with BERT to\nthe computation of 10,000 sentence embeddings\n(~5 seconds with SBERT) and computing cosine-\nsimilarity (~0.01 seconds). By using optimized\nindex structures, \ufb01nding the most similar Quora\nquestion can be reduced from 50 hours to a few\nmilliseconds (Johnson et al., 2017).\nWe \ufb01ne-tune SBERT on NLI data, which cre-\nates sentence embeddings that signi\ufb01cantly out-\nperform other state-of-the-art sentence embedding Related Work\nWe \ufb01rst introduce BERT, then, we discuss state-\nof-the-art sentence embedding results\nare depicted in Table 7.\nModel CPU GPU\nAvg.

Methods in Natural Language Process-\ning, pages 1631\u20131642,", " Introduction\nGraphs, or networks, are a mathematical representation of data that consists of discrete objects (nodes\nor vertices) and relationships between these objects (edges). For example, in a brain, regions of in-\nterest can be vertices, the edges represent the presence of a structural connection between them [1].\nSince graphs necessarily deal with relationships between nodes, classical statistical assumptions about\nindependence are violated. Thus, novel methodology is required for performing statistical inference on\ngraphs and populations of graphs [2]. While the theory for inference on graphs is highly developed, to\ndate, there has not existed a numerical package implementing these methods for embedding a single graph [2]. Omnibus embedding and mul-\ntiple adjacency spectral embedding (MASE) allows for embedding multiple graphs into the same\nsubspace such that the embeddings can be meaningfully compared [9, 10]. GraSPy includes a\nmethod for choosing the number of embedding dimensions automatically [11].\nModels GraSPy includes classes for \ufb01tting random graph models to an input graph (Figure 2). Cur-\nrently, ER, SBM, DCER, DCSBM, and RDPG are supported for model estimation. After \ufb01tting\na model to data, the model class can also output goodness-of-\ufb01t metrics (mean squared error,\nlikelihood) and the number of estimated model parameters, allowing for model selection. The\nmodel classes can also be used to sample new simulated graphs based on the \ufb01t model.\nInference Given two graphs, a natural question to ask is whether these graphs are both random\nsamples from the same generative distribution. GraSPy provides two types of test for this null\nhypothesis: a latent position test and a latent distribution test. Both tests are framed under the\nRDPG model, where the generative distribution for the graph can be modeled as a set of latent\npositions. The latent position test can only be performed on two graphs of the same size and with\nknown correspondence between the vertices of the two graphs [13]. The latent distribution test\ncan be performed on graphs without vertex alignment, or even with slightly different numbers of\nvertices [14].\nCluster GraSPy extends Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and k-means from scikit-learn to\nsweep over a speci\ufb01ed range of parameters and choose the best clustering [15]. The number\nof clusters and covariance structure for each GMM is chosen by Bayesian information criterion\n(BIC), which is a penalized likelihood function to evaluate the quality of estimators [16]. Silhouette\nscore is used to choose the number of clusters for k-means [17]. Clustering is often useful for\ncomputing the the community structure of vertices after embedding.\nPlotGraSPy extends seaborn to visualize graphs as adjacency matrices and embedded graphs as\npaired scatter plots [18]. Individual graphs can be visualized using heatmap function, and multiple\ngraphs can be overlaid on top of each other using gridplot. The nodes in both graph visualizations\ncan be sorted by various node metadata, such as node degree or assigned node labels. Pairplot\ncan visualize high dimensional data, such as embeddings, as a pairwise scatter plot.\n3IER RDPG DCSBM\nDCER SBM ERK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nI\nK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nI\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nFigure 2: Connectome model \ufb01tting using GraSPy .

Modern TTS systems\nare based on complex, multi-stage processing pipelines,\neach of which may rely on hand-engineered features and\nheuristics. Due to this complexity, developing new TTS\nsystems can be very labor intensive and dif\ufb01cult.\nDeep V oice is inspired by traditional text-to-speech\npipelines and adopts the same structure, while replacing all\ncomponents with neural networks and using simpler fea-\ntures: \ufb01rst we convert text to phoneme and then use an\naudio synthesis model to convert linguistic features into\nspeech (Taylor, 2009). Unlike prior work (which uses\nhand-engineered features such as spectral envelope, spec-\ntral parameters, aperiodic parameters, etc.), our only fea-\ntures are phonemes with stress annotations, phoneme du-\nrations, and fundamental frequency (F0). This choice of\nfeatures makes our system more readily applicable to new\ndatasets, voices, and domains without any manual data an-\nnotation or additional feature engineering. We demonstrate\nthis claim by retraining our entire pipeline without any hy-\nperparameter changes on an entirely new dataset that con-\ntains solely audio and unaligned textual transcriptions and\ngenerating relatively high quality speech. In a conventional\nTTS system this adaptation requires days to weeks of tun-\ning, whereas Deep V oice allows you to do it in only a few\nhours of manual effort and the time it takes models to train.arXiv:1702.07825v2  [cs.CL]  7 Mar 2017Deep Voice: Real-time Neural TTS\nReal-time inference is a requirement for a production-\nquality TTS system; without it, the system is unusable for\nmost applications of TTS. Prior work has demonstrated that\na WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016) can generate close to\nhuman-level speech. However, WaveNet inference poses a\ndaunting computational problem due to the high-frequency,\nautoregressive nature of the model, and it has been hitherto\nunknown whether such models can be used in a produc-\ntion system. We answer this question in the af\ufb01rmative and\ndemonstrate ef\ufb01cient, faster-than-real-time WaveNet infer-\nence kernels that produce high-quality 16 kHz audio and\nrealize a 400X speedup over previous WaveNet inference\nimplementations (Paine et al., 2016).\n2. Related Work\nPrevious work uses neural networks as substitutes for\nseveral TTS system components, including grapheme-to-\nphoneme conversion models (Rao et al., 2015; Yao &\nZweig, 2015), phoneme duration prediction models (Zen\n& Sak, 2015), fundamental frequency prediction models\n(Pascual & Bonafonte, 2016; Ronanki et al., 2016), and\naudio synthesis models (van den Oord et al., 2016; Mehri\net al., 2016). Unlike Deep V oice, however, none of these\nsystems solve the entire problem of TTS and many of them\nuse specialized hand-engineered features developed specif-\nically for their domain.\nMost recently, there has been a lot of work in paramet-\nric audio synthesis, notably WaveNet, SampleRNN, and\nChar2Wav (van den Oord et al., 2016; Mehri et al., 2016;\nSotelo et al., 2017). While WaveNet can be used for\nboth conditional and unconditional audio generation, Sam-\npleRNN is only used for unconditional audio generation.\nChar2Wav extends SampleRNN with an attention-based\nphoneme duration model and the equivalent of an F0 pre-\ndiction model, effectively providing local conditioning in-\nformation to a SampleRNN-based vocoder.\nDeep V oice differs from these systems in several key as-\npects that notably increase the scope of the problem. First,\nDeep V oice is completely standalone; training a new Deep\nV oice", " Introduction\nMany current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\nity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In\nmachine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words\nor less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in\nany signi\ufb01cant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\nWith progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more\ncomplex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably\nthe most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [10]. For example, neural\nnetwork based language models signi\ufb01cantly outperform N-gram models [1, 27, 17].\n1.1 Goals of the Paper\nThe main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word\nvectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary. As\nfar as we know, none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more\n1arXiv:1301.3781v3  [cs.CL]  7 Sep 2013than a few hundred of millions of words, with a modest dimensionality of the word vectors between\n50 - 100.\nWe use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representa-\ntions, with the expectation that not only will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that\nwords can have multiple degrees of similarity [20]. This has been observed earlier in the context\nof in\ufb02ectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for\nsimilar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to \ufb01nd words that have similar\nendings [13, 14].\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple\nsyntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are per-\nformed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(\u201dKing\u201d) - vector(\u201dMan\u201d) + vec-\ntor(\u201dWoman\u201d) experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also\ninteresting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [30] and others. We believe that\nour comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for\nestimating the word vectors. We also expect that high quality word vectors will become an important\nbuilding block for future NLP applications.\n107 Follow-Up Work\nAfter the initial version of this paper was written, we published single-machine multi-threaded C++\ncode for computing the word vectors, using both the continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram archi-\ntectures4.

Furthermore, it could inspire future research on geometry-aware techniques and improve methodologies for 3D modeling and animation, ultimately benefiting both academic and industry practitioners.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in this problem stem from the complexities of accurately binding skeletons to 3D models, especially when dealing with non-canonical poses and dynamic clothing. Naive approaches may fail due to their reliance on nearest neighbor criteria, which do not account for the geometric intricacies of the models. Additionally, achieving continuous deformation of clothing while maintaining accurate skeleton binding requires sophisticated algorithms that can handle the variability in shape and motion, making the problem technically and theoretically demanding.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often overlooked the importance of geometry-aware techniques in avatar rigging and animation, leading to limitations in realism and accuracy.

By developing adaptive 3D avatars that can respond to user feedback and contextual cues, this work has the potential to revolutionize user interaction in virtual environments, making them more engaging and realistic. The implications extend to various fields such as gaming, education, and remote collaboration, enabling richer social interactions and more effective learning environments. Moreover, this research could pave the way for future advancements in human-computer interaction, machine learning, and computer graphics, setting a new standard for avatar realism and adaptability.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexity of this problem arises from several challenges. First, the integration of lightweight temporal convolutional networks with diffusion models requires sophisticated architecture design and optimization to ensure real-time performance without sacrificing quality. Second, capturing and simulating complex human motion and behavior dynamically is inherently difficult due to the vast variability in human actions and environmental contexts. Naive approaches may fail to account for this variability, leading to avatars that are either too generic or incapable of adapting to real-time changes. Additionally, the need for effective user feedback mechanisms and contextual understanding introduces further technical and practical obstacles. Addressing these complexities necessitates advanced methodologies and a deep understanding of both machine learning principles and AR/VR dynamics.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research in 3D avatar generation has often focused on either static representations or limited interaction capabilities, lacking the adaptive, real-time synthesis that this proposal aims to achieve. Many existing models do not effectively integrate user feedback or contextual cues, which are critical for creating truly interactive experiences. Additionally, the computational demands of high-quality rendering often prevent real-time performance. Barriers such as insufficient data on human behavior in dynamic environments and the complexity of integrating multiple machine learning frameworks have hindered progress. This proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging the strengths of both temporal convolutional networks and diffusion models, along with reinforcement learning, to create a more holistic and adaptive avatar generation framework.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid generative model that integrates lightweight temporal convolutional networks with diffusion models. This model will utilize a dataset comprising diverse human motion capture and auditory inputs to train the avatars. The approach will employ reinforcement learning techniques to adapt the avatars' behaviors based on user interactions and contextual cues. Performance metrics will include real-time rendering speed, user engagement levels, and the quality of avatar interactions. Expected outcomes include the successful synthesis of adaptive 3D avatars that can engage in dynamic behaviors in real-time, providing users with a more immersive and responsive experience in AR and VR environments.

Recently, this field\nhas witnessed a paradigm shift towards inverse rendering techniques that esti-\nmate the shape and appearance of a scene from visual input [105,106]. Among\nthe many representations developed in this area are neural (radiance) fields [75,\n95], neural volumes, surfaces, and signed distance fields [63,73,83,94,113,122]\nas well as differentiable rasterization techniques for meshes [39,61] and point\nclouds [40,41,48,124]. Recent inverse rendering approaches are capable of mod-\neling dynamic scenes [25,84,89,108] and enable sophisticated post-capture de-\nformations [36,126].4 Yang Zheng et al.\n2.2 Animatable Avatars\nOne central requirement for generating full-body digital humans is to enable\nanimations driven by skeleton-level control [42,71]. To this end, early works on\navatar reconstruction primarily relied on skinning techniques, which successfully\nmodel the dynamics of bodies with minimal or tight clothing [3,64]. Clothing is\nan integral part of everyday human appearance, captured by the saying \u201cclothes\nmake the (wo)man\u201d. Reconstructing their dynamic behavior from visual data,\nhowever, remains a challenge. Several different types of representations have\nbeen explored for clothed avatars, including meshes [68] with dynamic textures\n[4,33,131], neural surface [16,90,107] and radiance fields [14,18,24,27,44\u201346,\n86,87,99,133], point sets [66,67,69], and 3D Gaussians [34,58,82,134].

In recent years, diffusion\nmodels have become the de-facto approach for generating\nhigh-resolution images and videos from natural language\ninputs with impressive generalization capabilities (Saharia\net al., 2022b; Ramesh et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022;\nPodell et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Esser et al., 2023;\nBlattmann et al., 2023b; Betker et al., 2023; Blattmann et al.,\n2023a; Singer et al., 2022). Due to their iterative nature\nand the associated computational costs, as well as the long\nsampling times during inference, research on formulations\nfor more efficient training and/or faster sampling of these\nmodels has increased (Karras et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022).\nWhile specifying a forward path from data to noise leads to\nefficient training, it also raises the question of which path\nto choose. This choice can have important implications\nfor sampling. For example, a forward process that fails to\nremove all noise from the data can lead to a discrepancy\nin training and test distribution and result in artifacts such\nas gray image samples (Lin et al., 2024). Importantly, the\nchoice of the forward process also influences the learned\nbackward process and, thus, the sampling efficiency. While\ncurved paths require many integration steps to simulate the\nprocess, a straight path could be simulated with a single\nstep and is less prone to error accumulation. Since each step\ncorresponds to an evaluation of the neural network, this has\na direct impact on the sampling speed.\nA particular choice for the forward path is a so-called Rec-\ntified Flow (Liu et al., 2022; Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden,\n2022; Lipman et al., 2023), which connects data and noise\non a straight line. Although this model class has better\ntheoretical properties, it has not yet become decisively es-\ntablished in practice. So far, some advantages have been\nempirically demonstrated in small and medium-sized ex-\nperiments (Ma et al., 2024), but these are mostly limited to\nclass-conditional models. In this work, we change this by in-\ntroducing a re-weighting of the noise scales in rectified flow\nmodels, similar to noise-predictive diffusion models (Ho\net al., 2020). Through a large-scale study, we compare\nour new formulation to existing diffusion formulations and\ndemonstrate its benefits.\nWe show that the widely used approach for text-to-image\nsynthesis, where a fixed text representation is fed directlyinto the model (e.g., via cross-attention (Vaswani et al.,\n2017; Rombach et al., 2022)), is not ideal, and present\na new architecture that incorporates learnable streams for\nboth image and text tokens, which enables a two-way flow\nof information between them. We combine this with our\nimproved rectified flow formulation and investigate its scala-\nbility.

Vari-\nous 3D representations have been employed for 3D con-\ntent generation, each with its own set of strengths and lim-\nitations. Triangulated meshes are a common choice due\nto their simplicity and compatibility with existing graphics\npipelines [14]. However, their inflexible topology can pose\nchallenges in accurately representing intricate geometries.\nAlternatively, volumetric representations, such as voxel\ngrids [40], offer flexibility in modeling complex shapes.\nNevertheless, their computational and memory costs grow\ncubically with resolution, impeding the faithful reconstruc-\ntion of fine geometry details and smooth surfaces. Re-\ncently, NeRFs [28] have gained prominence for modeling\n3D shapes, especially in text-to-3D applications, thanks to\ntheir ability to capture arbitrary topologies with minimal\nmemory usage. Yet, their rendering cost increases signif-\nicantly at higher resolutions. Some approaches adopt hy-\n2brid representations to harness the benefits of different tech-\nniques. The Mixture of V olumetric Primitives (MVP) rep-\nresentation [25], for instance, introduces volumetric prim-\nitives onto a template mesh, achieving rapid rendering by\nleveraging a convolutional network to compute volumetric\nprimitives. It generates images through ray-marching, ac-\ncumulating colors and opacities from the primitives. Gaus-\nsian Splatting [17] has emerged as a promising 3D repre-\nsentation for efficiently rendering high-resolution images.\nIt models objects using colored 3D Gaussians, which are\nrendered onto an image using splatting-based rasterization.\nHowever, a notable limitation is its difficulty in extract-\ning meshes from learned Gaussians, as it predominantly\ncaptures appearance details through 3D Gaussians without\nmodeling the underlying object surfaces.\nIn this work. we introduce a novel primitive-based 3D\nGaussian representation with implicit mesh learning. It en-\nables modeling dynamic and articulated objects like humans\nusing Gaussian Splatting while also facilitating textured\nmesh extraction. In comparison to MVP, our Gaussian-\nbased representation is more flexible and expressive, since\neach primitive comprises a variable number of 3D Gaus-\nsians with varying non-uniform locations that can go be-\nyond the primitive boundaries. This allows it to capture\nfiner details compared to the cubic primitives used in MVP.\nMoreover, our representation employs splatting-based ras-\nterization, enabling efficient rendering of high-resolution\nimages compared to traditional ray-marching techniques.\nText-to-3D Generation. The field of text-to-3D genera-\ntion has recently been revolutionized [4, 23, 30, 33, 33,\n41, 44] with the availability of large text-to-image mod-\nels [6, 34, 35, 49].

Traditional experiments. For \u03bbskin, we set it to 10for\nthe first 1kiterations for fast convergence to a reasonable skinning field, then decreased to 0.1for soft regularization.\nB. Implementation Details\nWe initialize the canonical 3D Gaussians with N= 50 krandom samples on the SMPL mesh surface in canonical pose.\nDuring optimization, we follow the same strategy from [14] to densify and prune the 3D Gaussians, using the view-space\nposition gradients derived from the transformed Gaussians Goin the observation space as the criterion for densification.\nWe then describe the network architectures of our learned neural components. For the forward skinning network f\u03b8r,\nwe use an MLP with 4hidden layers of 128dimensions which takes xc\u2208R3with no positional encoding and outputs a\n25-dimension vector. This vector is further propagated through a hierarchical softmax layer that is aware of the tree structure\nof the human skeleton to obtain the skinning weights wthat sum up to 1. To normalize the coordinates in the canonical space,\nwe proportionally pad the bounding box enclosing the canonical SMPL mesh instead of using the same length in all axes as\nin [59]. This allows us to use a lower resolution in the flat z-dimension of the human body.\nFor the non-rigid deformation network f\u03b8nr, the 3D position xdis normalized with the aforementioned bounding box\nand first encoded into representative features with a multi-level hash grid, whose parameters are defined in Tab. 6. The\nconcatenation of the hash grid features and the pose latent code Zpthen go through a shallow MLP with 3hidden layers of\n128dimensions to decode pose-dependent local deformation.\nThe details of our color network structure F\u03b8care well elaborated in Sec. 4.3 of the main paper.

Specifically, we add a noise drawn from the\nnormal distribution N(0,0.1)to the SMPL pose parameters \u03b8with a probability of p= 0.5during training. The viewing\ndirection dis first canonicalized to the canonical space and then augmented with a random rotation derived from uniformly\nsampled roll, pitch, and yaw degrees \u2208[0,45). Adding noise to training signals helps the model to better generalize to novel\nposes and views.\nOur model is trained for a total of 15kiterations on the ZJU-MoCap dataset in 30minutes and 30kiterations on Peo-\npleSnapshot in 45minutes on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. We use Adam [16] to optimize our model and the per-frame\nlatent codes with hyperparameters \u03b21= 0.9and\u03b22= 0.999. The learning rate of 3D Gaussians is exactly the same as the\noriginal implementation from [14].

An exponential learning rate scheduler is employed to gradually decrease the learning rate by a factor of 0.1\non neural networks.

Our algorithm can extract a highly detailed mesh from any 3D Gaussian Splatting scene [15] within minutes on a single GPU ( top:\nRenderings of our meshes without texture, bottom: Renderings of the meshes with bound Gaussians).\nface of the scene from them: As shown in Figure 3, after\noptimization by 3D Gaussian Splatting, the Gaussians do\nnot take an ordered structure in general and do not corre-\nspond well to the actual surface of the scene. In addition to\nthe surface itself, it is also often desirable to represent the\nscene as a mesh, which remains the representation of choice\nin many pipelines: A mesh-based representation allows for\npowerful tools for editing, sculpting, animating, and relight-\ning the scene. Because the Gaussians after Gaussian Splat-\nting are unstructured, it is very challenging to extract a mesh\nfrom them. Note that this is also challenging with NeRFs\nalbeit for different reasons.\nIn this paper, we first propose a regularization term that\nencourages the Gaussians to be well distributed over the\nscene surface so that the Gaussians capture much better the\nscene geometry, as shown in Figure 3. Our approach is to\nderive a volume density from the Gaussians under the as-\nsumption that the Gaussians are flat and well distributed\nover the scene surface. By minimizing the difference be-\ntween this density and the actual one computed from the\nGaussians during optimization, we encourage the 3D Gaus-\nsians to represent well the surface geometry.\nThanks to this regularization term, it becomes easier to\nextract a mesh from the Gaussians. In fact, since we intro-\nduce a density function to evaluate our regularization term,\na natural approach would be to extract level sets of this den-\nsity function. However, Gaussian Splatting performs den-sification in order to capture details of the scene with high\nfidelity, which methods that do not recover a mesh.\nPSNR \u2191SSIM \u2191LPIPS \u2193\nPlenoxels [42] 23.06 0.794 0.510\nINGP-Base [23] 23.62 0.796 0.423\nINGP-Big [23] 24.96 0.817 0.390\nMip-NeRF360 [2] 29.40 0.901 0.244\n3DGS [15] 29.41 0.903 0.242\nR-SuGaR-2K (Ours) 27.31 0.873 0.303\nR-SuGaR-7K (Ours) 29.30 0.893 0.273\nR-SuGaR-15K (Ours) 29.41 0.893 0.267\nTable 5.

Their impact spans a wide range of do-\nmains including architecture, animation, gaming, virtual and\naugmented reality, and is widely used in retail, online confer-\nencing, education, etc. The extensive use of 3D technologies\nbrings a significant challenge, i.e., generating high-quality\n3D content is a process that needs a lot of time, effort, and\nskilled expertise.\nThis stimulates the rapid developments of 3D content gen-\neration approaches [ 5,14,16,21\u201324,29,31,34,35,41,47].\nAmong them, text-to-3D generation [ 5,14,21,29,31,34,47,\n52] stands out for its ability to create imaginative 3D models\nfrom mere text descriptions. This is achieved by utilizing\na pretrained text-to-image diffusion model as a strong im-\nage prior to supervise the training of a neural parameterized\n3D model, enabling for rendering 3D consistent images in\nalignment with the text. This remarkable capability is funda-\nmentally grounded in the use of Score Distillation Sampling\n(SDS). SDS acts as the core mechanism that lifts 2D discussion.\n5\u201cA DSLR photo of the Imperial State Crown of England.\u201d\n\u201cA DSLR photo of a Schnauzer wearing a pirate hat .\u201d\nProlificDreamer(VSD)(~ 8hrs)Ours(~35mins)Fantasia3D(~ 1h)DreamFusion (SDS)(~ 30mins)Magic3D(~ 1h)\nFigure 4. Comparison with baselines Experiments of ISM\n7.3.1 Benefits of DDIM inversion\nIn the previous section, we visualize the inconsistency issue\nof SDS pseudo-GTs. In the methodology section of our main\npaper, we propose to mitigate such a problem by introducing\nDDIM inversion for noisy latent estimation. Hence, we\nfurther examine the effect of replacing the vanilla add noise\nfunction for x0\u2192xtwith DDIM inversion in Fig. 9 (d)\n9and (e). It can be seen that, the pseudo-GTs that incorporate\nwith DDIM inversion are more similar to the input views in\nFig. 9 (a). Therefore, they are significantly more consistent\nfeature and style-wise between different views and timesteps\ncompared to Fig. 9 (b) and (c). Meanwhile, such a property\nholds when we increase \u03b4Tfrom 20 to 200. Notably, DDIM\ninversion doesn\u2019t necessarily handle the quality problem of\nthe pseudo-GTs generated with a single-step prediction with\ndiffusion models. We will delve deeper into this problem in\nSec. 7.3.2.\n3D distillation v.s. image-to-image translation As we\ndiscussed in the main paper, ISM follows the basic intuition\nof SDS which generates pseudo-GTs with 2D diffusion mod-\nels by referencing x0. Intuitively, such a process is quite sim-\nilar to the diffusion-based image-to-image translation tasks\nthat have been discussed in some previous works [ 28,44]\nthat intend to alter the input image towards the given condi-\ntion in a similar manner. In such a perspective, since SDS\nperturbs the clean sample x0with random noises, it encoun-\nters the same problem with SDEdit [ 28] that it struggles to\nfind an ideal timestep twhich ensures both the editability of\nthe algorithm while maintaining the basic structure of the\ninput image.\nInstead, our ISM adopts DDIM inversion to estimate xt\nfromx0and thus share more common senses with DDIB [ 44]\nwhich mitigates the aforementioned problem. In essence,\nthe DDIB proposes to edit images in a first \u201cDDIM in-\nversion\u201d then \u201cDDIM denoising\u201d paradigm, which can be\nviewed as building two concatenated Schr\u00f6dinger bridges [ ?\n] that are intrinsically entropy-regularized optimal trans-\nport. Similarly, our proposed ISM can be seen as first bridg-\ning the distribution of rendered images q(x0)to the latent\nspace p\u03d5(xt)of pretrained diffusion models \u03d5via DDIM\ninversion, then, we bridge p\u03d5(xt)to the target", " Introduction\nIn the nineteenth century, the Anonymous Society of\nPainters, Sculptors, Printmakers, etc. started the art move-\nment called Impressionism, identified by a technique of\n\u201cshort, broken brushstrokes that barely convey forms\u201d. Our\ngoal, to create photorealistic representations of humans, is\none of the things that impressionists ran away from. How-\never, in D3GA1, we use Gaussian splats as a modern ver-\nsion of those short brushstrokes to conform to the structure\nand appearance of our real-time, reposable avatars.\nCreating drivable (i.e., that can be animated to gener-\nate new content) photorealistic humans currently requires\ndense multi-view data since monocular approaches lack ac-\ncuracy. Additionally, existing techniques rely on complex\npre-processing, including precise 3D registrations [1, 55,\n56]. However, obtaining those registrations requires iter-\native Related Work\nCurrent Methods based on backward map-\nping tend to accumulate errors in canonical space since they\nrequire an error-prone backward pass and have problems\nmodeling view-dependent effects since mapping the view\nvector to canonical space uniquely is non-trivial. There-\nfore, we decided to employ a forward-only mapping. D3GA\nis built on 3DGS extended by a neural representation and\ntetrahedral cages to model the color and geometry of each\ndynamic part of the avatar, respectively. In the following,we introduce the formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting and\ngive a detailed description of our method D3GA.\n3.1. 3D Gaussian Splatting\n3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [14] is designed for real-\ntime novel view synthesis in multi-view static scenes. Their\nrendering primitives are scaled 3D Gaussians [17, 52] with\na 3D covariance matrix \u03a3and mean \u00b5:\nG(x) =e\u22121\n2(x\u2212\u00b5)T\u03a3\u22121(x\u2212\u00b5). (1)\nTo splat the Gaussians, Zwicker et al. [66] define the pro-\njection of 3D Gaussians onto the image plane as:\n\u03a3\u2032=AW\u03a3WTAT, (2)\nwhere \u03a3\u2032is a covariance matrix in 2D space, Wis the view\ntransformation, and Ais the Jacobian of the affine approx-\nimation of the projective transformation. During optimiza-\ntion, enforcing the positive semi-definiteness of the covari-\nance matrix \u03a3is challenging. To avoid this, Kerbl et al. [14]\nuse an equivalent formulation of a 3D Gaussian as a 3D el-\nlipsoid parameterized with a scale Sand rotation R:\n\u03a3=RSSTRT. (3)\n3DGS uses spherical harmonics [40] to model the view-\ndependent color of each Gaussian. In practice, appearance\nis modeled with an optimizable 48 elements vector repre-\nsenting four bands of spherical harmonics.\n3.2. Cage Based Deformation Transfer\nTo deform 3D Gaussians, we leverage tetrahedron cage-\nbased deformations as a coarse proxy for the body, face, and\nindividual garments. To create a cage per garment, we seg-\nment all images of a single time instance using an Efficient-\nNet [47] backbone with PointRend [16] refinement, trained\non a corpus of similar multi-view captures. The per-image\n2D segmentation masks are projected onto a body mesh \u02c6M\n3to obtain per-triangle labels (body, upper, lower). To get the\nmesh \u02c6M, we fit a low-resolution LBS model to a single 3D\nscan of the subject and then fit such model to the segmented\nframe by minimizing the distance to the 3D keypoints, ex-\ntracted with an EfficientNet trained on similar captures. We\ntransform the body mesh into canonical space with LBS and\ndivide it into body part templates Mk. The garment meshes\nare additionally inflated 3cm along the vertex normals. Af-\nter that, we use TetGen [42] to turn the unposed meshes Mk\ninto tetrahedral meshes Tk. Consequently, cages for gar-\nments are hollow, containing only their outer layer, while\nthe body cage is solid. The face cage is composed of the\nbody", " INTRODUCTION\n3D content creation is important for many applications, such as interactive gaming, cinematic arts,\nAR/VR, and simulation. However, it is still challenging and expensive to create a high-quality 3D\nasset as it requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, automating this process with generative\nmodels has become an important problem, which remains challenging due to the scarcity of data\nand the complexity of 3D representations.\nRecently, techniques based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) (Poole et al., 2022; Lin et al.,\n2023; Chen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b), also known as Score Jacobian Chaining (SJC) (Wang\net al., 2023a), have emerged as a major research direction for text-to-3D generation, as they can\nproduce high-quality and intricate 3D experiments, we find that CSD combined\nwith general negative prompts can achieve high-quality texture quality comparable to VSD.\n5 E XPERIMENTS\nWe evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Classifier Score Distillation method across three tasks:\ntext-guided 3D generation, text-guided texture synthesis, and text-guided 3D editing. We present\nqualitative and quantitative analysis for text-guided 3D generation in Sec. 5.2 and text-guided texture\nsynthesis in Sec. 5.3. To further substantiate the superiority of our approach, we conduct user\nstudies for these two tasks.

Subsequently, the\nscene is converted into a triangular mesh via differentiable surface extraction (Shen et al., 2021) and\nfurther refined using high-resolution mesh renderings by differentiable rasterization (Laine et al.,\n2020). For the NeRF generation, we utilize the DeepFloyd-IF stage-I model (StabilityAI, 2023),\nand for the mesh refinement, we use the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model (Rombach et al., 2022) to\nenable high-resolution supervision. For both stages, CSD is used instead of SDS.\nText-Guided Texture Synthesis Given a mesh geometry and a text prompt, we apply CSD to ob-\ntain a texture field represented by Instant-NGP (M \u00a8uller et al., 2022). We employ ControlNets (Zhang\n& Agrawala, 2023) based on the Stable Diffusion 1.5 as our diffusion guidance since it can improve\nalignment between the generated textures and the underlying geometric structures. Specifically, we\napply Canny edge ControlNet where the edge is extracted from the rendered normal maps, and depth\nControlNet on rendered depth maps.

Furthermore, we can adjust the weights\n\u03c91and\u03c92to balance the alignment", " introduction of\nScore Distillation Sampling (SDS) (Poole et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a) enables leveraging the\npriors of pre-trained text-to-image models to facilitate text-conditioned generation in other domains,\nparticularly 3D content generation.\nSpecifically, given a pretrained diffusion model \u03f5\u03d5, SDS optimizes a set of parameters \u03b8of a differ-\nentiable parametric image generator g, using the gradient of the loss LSDSwith respect to \u03b8:\n\u2207\u03b8LSDS=w(t)\u0000\n\u03f5s\n\u03d5(zt(x);y, t)\u2212\u03f5\u0001\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8, (2)\nwhere x=g(\u03b8)is an image rendered by \u03b8,zt(x)is obtained by adding a Gaussian noise \u03f5tox\ncorresponding to the t-th timestep of the diffusion process, and yis a condition to the diffusion\nmodel. In practice, at every optimization iteration, different values of tand Gaussian noise \u03f5are\nrandomly drawn. The parameters \u03b8are then optimized by computing the gradient of LSDSwith\nrespect to xand backpropagating this gradient through the differentiable parametric function g.\nPoole et al. (2022) formally show that LSDSminimizes the KL divergence between a family of\nGaussian distributions around xand the distributions p(zt, y, t)learned by the pretrained diffusion\nmodel. Intuitively, Equation 2 can be interpreted as follows: since x=g(\u03b8)is a clean rendered\nimage, Gaussian noise is first added to it in order to approximately project it to the manifold of\nnoisy images corresponding to timestep t. Next, the score \u03f5s\n\u03d5(zt(x);y, t)provides the direction in\nwhich this noised version of xshould be moved towards a denser region in the distribution of real\nimages (noised to timestep tand aligned with the condition y). Finally, before the resulting direction\ncan be used to optimize \u03b8, the initially added noise \u03f5is subtracted. We interpret this last step as an\nattempt to adapt the direction back to the domain of clean rendered images.\nWhile SDS provides an elegant mechanism for leveraging pretrained text-to-image models, SDS-\ngenerated Appendix A.4, we provide comparison using threestudio (Guo et al., 2023) for all method appendix.\n4(a)xID (b)xOOD (c)\u03b4N (d)\u03b4D (e)xOOD+\u03b4D\nFigure 3: Visualization of \u03b4Nand\u03b4D. Columns (a) and (b) show a pair of in-domain ( xID) and\nout-of-domain ( xOOD) images, both depicting the same underlying content. We add the same noise\nto both images, and use the pre-trained diffusion model to predict the score. Intuitively, the noised\nxIDimage requires no domain correction, and thus the predicted score consists of only \u03b4N, shown in\n(c). Subtracting \u03b4Nfrom the prediction for the noised xOODimage gives us the domain correction\n\u03b4D, shown in (d). Indeed, adding \u03b4DtoxOODproduces a more realistic image, as shown in (e).zt\n \u03f5\u03d5(zt;\u2205, t)\u2212\u03f5\nt= 1 t= 100 t= 200 t= 300 t= 500 t= 700 t= 1000\nFigure 4: Visualization of \u03b4N\u2212\u03f5. Top row: noise \u03f5corresponding to different diffusion timesteps\ntis added to an in-domain image of a horse (as indicated below each column). Bottom row: the\nresidual \u03f5\u03d5(zt;\u2205, t)\u2212\u03f5between the network prediction and the actual noise. Since the original\nimage is in-domain (generated by SD), \u03b4D\u22480, and therefore, \u03f5\u03d5(zt;\u2205, t)\u2248\u03b4N. For visualization\npurposes, the residual is decoded and clamped between -1 and 1. Although we do not expect the\nresidual \u03b4N\u2212\u03f5to be correlated with the image, it may be seen that some correlation in fact exists,\nand furthermore, the residual becomes progressively noisier at smaller timesteps t.\nTo summarize so far, using the components discussed above, we can rewrite the CFG score as:\n\u03f5s\n\u03d5(zt;y, t) =\u03b4D+\u03b4N+s\u03b4C.

(2022) define the SDS loss using the difference between the CFG", "ABSTRACT\nDespite significant advances in large-scale text-to-image models, achieving hyper-\nrealistic human image generation remains a desirable yet unsolved task. Existing\nmodels like Stable Diffusion and DALL\u00b7E 2 tend to generate human images with\nincoherent parts or unnatural poses. To tackle these challenges, our key insight\nis that human image is inherently structural over multiple granularities, from the\ncoarse-level body skeleton to the fine-grained spatial geometry. Therefore, captur-\ning such correlations between the explicit appearance and latent structure in one\nmodel is essential to generate coherent and natural human images. To this end, we\npropose a unified framework, HyperHuman , that generates in-the-wild human\nimages of high realism and diverse layouts.

Our\nmodel enforces the joint learning of image appearance, spatial relationship, and\ngeometry in a unified network, where each branch in the model complements to\neach other with both structural awareness and textural richness. 3)Finally, to\nfurther boost the visual quality, we propose a Structure-Guided Refiner to com-\npose the predicted conditions for more detailed generation of higher resolution.\nExtensiveexperiments in the lightweight 512\u00d7512variant of our model: 1)w/o random dropout , where\nthe all the input conditions are not dropout or masked out during the conditional training stage. 2)\nOnly Text , where not any structural prediction is input to the model and we only use the text prompt\nas condition. 3)Condition on p, where we only use human pose skeleton pas input condition to\nthe refiner network. 4)Condition on dthat uses depth map das input condition. 5)Condition\nonnthat uses surface-normal nas input condition.

Since each\noptimization step may provide inconsistent 3D guidance, it\u2019s hard for the algorithm to correctly\ndensify the under-reconstruction regions or prune over-reconstruction regions as in reconstruction.\nThis observation leads us to the following mesh extraction and texture refinement designs.\n3.2 E FFICIENT MESH EXTRACTION\nPolygonal mesh is a widely used 3D representation, particularly in industrial applications. Many\nprevious works (Poole et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023; Tsalicoglou et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023a)\nexport the NeRF representation into a mesh-based representation for high-resolution fine-tuning.\nWe also seek to convert the generated 3D Gaussians into meshes and further refine the texture.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the polygonal mesh extraction from 3D Gaussians is still an unex-\nplored problem. Since the spatial density is described by a large number of 3D Gaussians, brute-\nforce querying of a dense 3D density grid can be slow and inefficient. It\u2019s also unclear how to extract\nthe appearance in 3D, as the color blending is only defined with projected 2D Gaussians (Kerbl et al.,\n2023). Here, we propose an efficient algorithm to extract a textured mesh based on block-wise local\ndensity query and back-projected color.\nLocal Density Query.

Recently, NeRF [28] facilitates photorealistic novel\nview synthesis through the use of MLPs. Subsequent re-\nsearch has expanded the utility of NeRF to various applica-\ntions, encompassing tasks such as mesh reconstruction from\na collection of images [20, 45], inverse rendering [5, 25, 54],\noptimization of camera parameters [21, 47, 48], and few-\nshot learning [10, 51].\nConstructing radiance fields for dynamic scenes is a crit-\nical branch in the advancement of NeRF, with significant\nimplications for real-world applications. A cardinal chal-\nlenge in rendering these dynamic scenes lies in the encod-\ning and effective utilization of temporal information, espe-\ncially when addressing the reconstruction of monocular dy-\nnamic scenes, a task inherently involves sparse reconstruc-\ntion from a single viewpoint. One class of dynamic NeRF\napproaches models scene deformation by adding time tas\nan additional input to the radiance field. However, this strat-\negy couples the positional variations induced by temporal\nchanges with the radiance field, lacking the geometric prior\ninformation regarding the influence of time on the scene.\nConsequently, substantial regularization is required to en-\nsure temporal consistency in the rendering results. experiments, we\nuniformly used a black Experiments on FPS with respect to the number of 3D Gaussians.

Creating high-quality and\nexpressive 3D avatars is challenging since the geometry\nand appearance of the character has to be modelled under a\nvariety of different poses. Traditional pipelines used in the\nentertainment industry often use sophisticated multi-view\ncapture studios [3, 22, 32] to create complex 3D models.\nManual processes like cleaning and rigging the scans\nmake creating an animatable character time-consuming\nand expensive. While there is recent progress on\nautomatic learning-based body reconstruction from single\nimage [20, 28, 29, 48, 49, 67, 68, 70], or sparse\nimages [54], such Related Work\nRecently, there has been rapid progress on extending\ntext-to-2D-image generation results. Experiments\nWe first demonstrate our expressive, holistic, animation of\nthe avatars, then evaluate their quality, and the consistency\nbetween texture and geometry. Finally, ablation studies are\nconducted to analyze the effectiveness of each component.\n5.1. Expressive Holistic Body Animation\nOne crucial feature that distinguishes our method from\nothers is that TADA enables natural full-body animations\nover the face, body and hands. Figure 4 illustrates the\nanimation of characters generated by TADA using only with\ntext as input. In the first case, we convert text to audio [61]\nand then use TalkSHOW [72] create expressive SMPL-X\nanimations of the upper body, face and hands. In the second\ncase we use priorMDM [53] to convert text into SMPL [31]\nanimations, which we convert to SMPL-X [39]. Thanks\nsemantic correspondence with SMPL-X, the characters are\neasily animated with natural movements of the fully body\nand face. This consistency with SMPL-X means that avatars\ngenerated by TADA can be animated using any of the recent\ntext to animation Discussion\nWhile TADA shows promising Conclusion\nWe introduce TADA, a simple yet effective method\nfor generating high-quality and animatable 3D textured\navatars solely from text input. These avatars cover\na wide range of individuals, including celebrities and\ncustomized characters. They seamlessly integrate into\nexisting CG pipelines, catering to various industries\nlike fashion and entertainment. The key contributions\ninclude: 1) utilizing a subdivided version of SMPL-X with\nlearned displacement layer and UV texture, 2) employing\nhierarchical optimization with adaptive focal lengths, 3)\nenforcing geometry-texture alignment through geometric\nconsistency loss, and 4) training with animation to keep\nsemantic correspondence with SMPL-X.

Traditional manual construc-\ntion of these intricate 3D models is a labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming process, requiring thousands of hours from\nskilled artists possessing extensive aesthetic and 3D mod-\neling expertise. Consequently, automating the generation of\nhigh-quality 3D avatars using only natural language descrip-\ntions holds great research prospects with the potential to\nsave resources, which is also the goal of our work.\nIn recent years, significant efforts have been made in\nreconstructing high-fidelity 3D avatars from multi-view\nvideos (Isik et al. 2023; Jiang et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023b;\nWang et al. 2023a; Zheng et al. 2023) or reference images\n(Wang et al. 2021; Xiu et al. 2022).

By progressively narrowing the camera distance,\nthe model can leverage the detail inherent in the latent diffu-\nsion, thereby eliminating a large number of floating artifacts\nand enhancing local details, such as the sword in the back.\nThe focus mode further zooms in and utilizes a resolution\nof 512 \u00d7512 to target and optimize certain body parts, gen-\nerating high-definition and intricate local details.

In contrast, recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) meth-\nods build on continuous scene representations, typically optimizing\na Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using volumetric ray-marching for\nnovel-view synthesis of captured scenes. Similarly, the most efficient\nradiance field solutions to date build on continuous representations\nby interpolating values stored in, e.g., voxel [Fridovich-Keil and Yu\net al.2022] or hash [M\u00fcller et al .2022] grids or points [Xu et al .2022].\nWhile the continuous nature of these results\nin a moderate increase in Gaussians to process which however is\namortized by simpler control flow and high parallelism of optimized\nGPU Radix sort [Merrill and Grimshaw 2010].

In this report,\nwe focus on the latter and unveil SDXL , a drastically improved version of Stable Diffusion .Stable\nDiffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model (DM) which serves as the foundation for an\narray of recent advancements in, e.g., 3D classi\ufb01cation [ 43], controllable image editing [ 54], image\npersonalization [ 10], synthetic data augmentation [ 48], graphical user interface prototyping [ 51], etc.\nRemarkably, the scope of applications has been extraordinarily extensive, encompassing \ufb01elds as\ndiverse as music generation [9] and reconstructing images from fMRI brain scans [49].\nUser studies demonstrate that SDXL consistently surpasses all previous versions of Stable Diffusion\nby a signi\ufb01cant margin (see Fig. 1). In this report, we present the design choices which lead to this\nboost in performance encompassing i)a 3\u0002larger UNet-backbone compared to previous Stable\nDiffusion models (Sec. 2.1), ii)two simple yet effective additional conditioning techniques (Sec. 2.2)\nwhich do not require any form of additional supervision, and iii)a separate diffusion-based re\ufb01nement\nmodel which applies a noising-denoising process [ 28] to the latents produced by SDXL to improve\nthe visual quality of its samples (Sec. 2.5).\nA major concern in the \ufb01eld of visual media creation is that while black-box-models are often\nrecognized as state-of-the-art, the opacity of their architecture prevents faithfully assessing and\nvalidating their performance. This lack of transparency hampers reproducibility, sti\ufb02es innovation,\nand prevents the community from building upon these models to further the progress of science and\nart. Moreover, these closed-source strategies make it challenging to assess the biases and limitations\nof these models in an impartial and objective way, which is crucial for their responsible and ethical\ndeployment. With SDXL we are releasing an open model that achieves competitive performance with\nblack-box image generation models (see Fig. 10 & Fig. 11).\n2 Improving Stable Diffusion\nIn this section we present our improvements for the Stable Diffusion architecture. These are modular,\nand can be used individually or together to extend any model. Although the following strategies are\nimplemented as extensions to latent diffusion models (LDMs) [ 38], most of them are also applicable\nto their pixel-space counterparts.\nFigure 1: Left: Comparing user preferences between SDXL andStable Diffusion 1.5 & 2.1. While SDXL already\nclearly outperforms Stable Diffusion 1.5 & 2.1, adding the additional re\ufb01nement stage boosts performance. Right:\nVisualization of the two-stage pipeline: We generate initial latents of size 128\u0002128using SDXL . Afterwards,\nwe utilize a specialized high-resolution re\ufb01nement model and apply SDEdit [ 28] on the latents generated in the\n\ufb01rst step, using the same prompt. SDXL and the re\ufb01nement model use the same autoencoder.\n2.1 Architecture & Scale\nStarting with the seminal works Ho et al. [14] and Song et al.

It has wide\napplications in robotics, animation, games, and generative creation. Given a text description or audio\ncommand, motion generation can be controllable to obtain the desired human motion sequence.\nText-conditioned motion generation has garnered increasing attention in recent years since it behaves\nin a more natural interactive way [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nAlthough existing text-motion datasets [ 4,11,6,8] have greatly facilitated the development of motion\ngeneration [ 2,12,13,14,9], their scale, diversity, and expressive capability remain unsatisfactory.\nImagine generating \u201c a man is playing the piano happily \", as depicted in Fig. 1(a), the motion\nfrom existing dataset [ 4] only includes the body movements, without finger movements or facial\nexpressions. The missing hand gestures and facial expressions severely hinder the high level of\nexpressiveness and realism of the motion. Additionally, certain specialized motions, such as high-\nlevel skiing, aerial work, and riding are challenging to be captured in indoor scenes. To sum up,\nexisting datasets suffer from four main limitations: 1) body-only motions without facial expressions\nand hand poses; 2) insufficient diversity and quantity, only covering indoor scenes; 3) lacking diverse\nand long-term motion sequences; and 4) manual text labels that are unscalable, unprofessional\nand labor-intensive.

However, the optimization\nprocess suffers slow convergence and the resultant 3D models often exhibit two\nlimitations: (a) quality concerns such as missing attributes and distorted shape and\ntexture; (b) extremely low diversity comparing to text-guided image synthesis. In\nthis paper, we show that the conflict between the 3D optimization process and\nuniform timestep sampling in score distillation is the main reason for these limi-\ntations. To resolve this conflict, we propose to prioritize timestep sampling with\nmonotonically non-increasing functions, which aligns the 3D optimization pro-\ncess with the sampling process of diffusion model.

This way,\nthe updates", " Introduction\nThe remarkable progress in Large Language Models [ 40,8] has sparked considerable interest in\ngenerating a wide variety of media modalities from text. There has been signi\ufb01cant progress in\ntext-to-image [ 43,44,46,61,9,28], text-to-speech [ 31,35], text-to-music [ 2,15] and text-to-3D\n[17,37] generation, to name a few. Key to the success of some of the popular generative image Related Work\nThere is considerable work related to diffusion models [ 52] and their applications to image generation\n[13,29,10,46,44,49,48] or image editing [ 18,47,12,26]. Our focus is on text-to-3D [ 17,37,41]\nand more speci\ufb01cally on realistic 3D human generation conditioned on text prompts. In the following\nsubsections we revisit some of the relevant work related to our goals.\nText-to-3D generation. CLIP-Forge [ 50] combines CLIP [ 39] text-image embeddings with a learned\n3D shape prior to generate 3D objects without any labeled text-to-3D pairs. DreamFields [ 17]\noptimizes a NeRF model given a text prompt using guidance from CLIP [ 39]. CLIP-Mesh [ 19] also\nuses CLIP, but substitutes NeRF with meshes as its underlying 3D representation. DreamFusion [ 37]\nbuilds on top of DreamFields and uses supervision from a diffusion-based text-to-image-model [ 48].\nLatent-NeRF [ 24] uses a similar strategy with DreamFusion, but optimizes a NeRF that operates\nin the space of a Latent Diffusion model [ 46]. TEXTure [ 45] takes as input both a text prompt\nand a target mesh and optimizes the texture map to agree with the input prompt. Magic3D [ 22]\nuses a 2-stage strategy that combines Neural Radiance Fields with meshes for high resolution 3D\ngeneration. Unlike our method, all mentioned works produce a static 3D scene given a text prompt.\nWhen queried with human related prompts, background and the\n\ufb01nal geometry includes additional objects such as the ground \ufb02oor, or even the shadow of the person\naround the legs\nOther details. We optimize the NeRF and the imGHUM shape parameters \finstead of randomly\nsampling shape parameters. This is because the body shape is often explicitly or implicitly described\nin the caption. We generate one avatar with an underlying body shape given all constraints coming\nfrom the text prompt and the related losses. Similarly with DreamFusion, we randomly sample\ncamera positions in spherical coordinates and then augment the input prompt with view-dependent\nconditioning based on the azimuth and elevation. We also randomly select the radius rfrom the\norigin as well as the focal length of the camera. For additional details please see our Supplementary\nMaterial.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We show how the individual\nproposed components help, and how we compare to recent state-of-the-art Conclusion\nWe presented DreamHuman , a novel method for generating 3D human avatars from text. Our method\nleverages statistical 3D human body models and recent advances in 3D modelling and text-to-3D\ngeneration to create animatable 3D human avatars, without any paired text-to-3D supervision. We\nillustrated that our method can generate photorealistic", "ABSTRACT\nThe advancements in automatic text-to-3D generation have been remarkable.\nMost existingmethods (Wang et al., 2023b; Lin\net al., 2023) employ the full training pipeline, which includes NeRF representation followed by fine-\ntuning.\n22Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n``Aladybug\u201d\nOursDreamFusion\n``Michelangelo style statue of dog reading news on a cellphone\u201dOursDreamFusion\n``A3d model of an adorable cottage with a thatched roof\u201dOursDreamFusion\n``A lionfish\u201dOursDreamFusion\nFigure 18: Additional visual comparisons with DreamFusion (Poole et al., 2022).\n23Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n4K iters 7K iters 10K iters\nFigure 19: Visualexperiments.

We employ\na pre-trained SD model3as diffusion prior, as well as a pre-trained dense prediction model4to\npredict disparity maps.\nTraining setup. We use Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 10\u22122for instant-\nngp encoding, and 10\u22123for NeRF weights. In practice, we choose total iter as 104iterations.\nThe rendering resolution is 512\u00d7512. We employ DDIM (Song et al., 2021) with empirically\nchosen parameters r= 0.25,and\u03b7= 1 to accelerate training. We choose the hyper-parameters\n\u03bbrgb= 0.1, \u03bbd= 0.1, and \u03bbzvar= 3. Similar to prior work (Poole et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023;\nWang et al., 2023a), we use classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022) of 100for our diffusion\nmodel.\nA.2 T RAINING ALGORITHM\nWe present our training procedure in Algorithm 1. In step 5, either a single-step or multi-step\ndenoising approach can be used to estimate the latent vector z. Here, the multi-step denoising refers\nto the iterative denoising of \u02c6zt, until t= 0.\nAlgorithm 1 Training Procedure\nInput: A pre-trained SD Rombach et al.

We observed that while integrating\nthe z-variance loss Lzvarsharpens the density distribution along the rays, it also intensifies the flick-\nering appearance. We consider the issue arising from the increased challenges of estimating the\nPDF of volume density along these rays. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective kernel\nsmoothing (KS) technique for coarse-to-fine importance sampling during rendering. Specifically,\nthe KS approach involves a weighted moving average of neighboring PDF values estimated during\nthe coarse stage. The weight is defined by a sliding window kernel. This ensures a broader sam-\npling scope near the high-density regions in the refined stage. Formally, in the coarse stage, for\neach weight vialong a ray r, the KS approach flattens the weight as vi=PN\nj=1Kj\u00b7vi+j\u2212\u230aN\n2\u230bPN\nj=1Kj, where\nK\u2208RNis the kernel. In practice, we set K= [1,1,1]. In Fig. 3, we visualized in (a) the ground\ntruth and the estimated distribution of volume density along a NeRF", " Introduction\n3D content and technologies enable us to visualize, comprehend, and interact with complex objects\nand environments that are reflective of our real-life experiences. Their pivotal role extends across a\nwide array of domains, encompassing architecture, animation, gaming, and the rapidly evolving fields\nof virtual and augmented reality. In spite of the extensive applications, the production of premium 3D\ncontent often remains a formidable task. It necessitates a significant investment of time and effort,\neven when undertaken by professional designers. This challenge has prompted the development of\ntext-to-3D methods, and\nwe use the same setting of CFG (e.g. 7.5) as the common text-to-image generation task for the best\nperformance. To the best of our knowledge, this for the first time addresses the problem in previous\nSDS [ 34,20,4,29] that it usually requires a large CFG (i.e., 100). Specifically, SDS (Eq. (3)) uses\n(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5)while VSD (Eq. (9))) uses (\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y )). For example,\nfor the 2D special case of g(\u03b8, c)\u2261\u03b8, we have \u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)]and\n\u2207\u03b8LVSD(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y ))]. Intuitively, to obtain highly detailed\nsamples, the updating direction for \u03b8needs to be \u201cfine\u201d and \u201csharp\u201d. As SDS only depends on \u03f5pretrain ,\nit needs a large CFG ( = 100 ) to make sure \u03f5pretrain to be \u201csharp\u201d enough; however, large CFG, in turn,\nreduces the diversity of the results of ProlificDreamer compared with baselines.\n36 Background\nWe present preliminaries on diffusion models, score distillation sampling, and 3D representations.\nDiffusion models. A diffusion model [ 46,14,49] involves a forward process {qt}t\u2208[0,1]to gradually\nadd noise to a data point x0\u223cq0(x0)and a reverse process {pt}t\u2208[0,1]to denoise/generate data. The\nforward process is defined by qt(xt|x0):=N(\u03b1tx0, \u03c32\ntI)andqt(xt):=R\nqt(xt|x0)q0(x0)dx0,\nwhere \u03b1t, \u03c3t>0are hyperparameters satisfying \u03b10\u22481, \u03c30\u22480, \u03b11\u22480, \u03c31\u22481; and the reverse\nprocess is defined by denoising from p1(x1):=N(0,I)with a parameterized noise prediction\n2A prolific dreamer is someone who experiences vivid dreams quite regularly [ 50], which corresponds to the\nhigh-fidelity and diverse Appendix G to demonstrate the scalability of VSD.\nWe leave the experiments. As shown\nin Table 5, VSD with 4 particles slightly outperforms VSD with 1 particles in the 3D setting; and as\nshown in Table 6, VSD with 8 particles slightly outperforms VSD with 4 particles in the 2D setting.\n29Table 6: 2D sample quality by different samplers, 1000 prompts.\nMethod SDS VSD (n=4) VSD (n=8) DPM++\nFID ( \u2193) 90.09 68.02 66.68 47.91\nVSD outperforms SDS in 2D. As shown in Table 6, the FID by VSD is much better than SDS. As\nthe 2D setting isolates the sampling algorithm from the 3D representations, we can directly compare\ndifferent sampling algorithms, finding that VSD can get better sample quality than SDS (though still\nworse than SOTA diffusion samplers, it can generalize to 3D cases).\nL Why using SDS in stage-2 for the geometry optimization of mesh?\nVSD can also be used to generate geometry. To validate this, we provide an ablation example in\nFig. 21 (3a),(3b). As shown in the figure, VSD can obtain reasonable geometry. Although the some\npart of the geometry from VSD is with more details than SDS (including the tail of the horse), on\nthe whole, the result from VSD is similar with SDS. We conjecture that this is because currently the\ntriangle size of", " Introduction\nThe creation and animation of 3D digital avatars are essential for various applications, including film\nand cartoon production, video game design, and immersive media such as AR and VR.

It has numerous applications (e.g., anima-\ntion/game production [29] and virtual try-on [56]), attract-\ning signi\ufb01cant attention from academia and industry.\nWhile earlier controllable HIG solutions based on gener-\native adversarial networks (GANs) [10,23\u201326,33,44,51,54]\nand variational auto-encoders (V AEs) [7, 14, 34, 46] have\nbeen successfully applied in certain applications (e.g., vir-\ntual try-on), they have not gained mainstream acceptance\ndue to their training dif\ufb01culties and poor multi-modality fu-\nsion and alignment capabilities [52]. Recently, diffusion\nmodels [12, 35, 40] have demonstrated unprecedented text-\nto-image generation performance [32] and quickly become\nthe dominant technique in this exciting \ufb01eld. However, it is\ndif\ufb01cult to provide precise position control with text infor-\nmation, especially for deformable objects such as humans.\nTo tackle the above problem, two concurrent controllable\ndiffusion models were proposed in the literature: Control-\nNet [53] and T2I-Adapter [27]. Both models introduce an\nadditional learnable diffusion branch on top of the frozen\npre-trained stable diffusion (SD) model [35]. The addi-\ntional branch enables the enforcement of various conditions\nsuch as skeleton and sketch during image generation, which\ngreatly improves the original SD model in terms of control-\nlability, thereby gaining huge traction from the community.\nHowever, the learnable branch in such dual-branch dif-\nfusion models is essentially performing a challenging im-\nage feature editing task and suffers from several limita-\ntions. Consider the skeleton-guided controllable HIG prob-\nlem that generates humans with speci\ufb01c poses. Given text\nprompts containing human activities, the SD branch may\ngenerate various images that are inconsistent with the skele-\nton guidance, e.g., humans could present at different places\nwith various poses. Therefore, the extra condition branch\nneeds to learn not only how to generate humans according\nto the given skeleton guidance but also how to suppress var-\nious inconsistencies, making training more challenging and\ninference less stable. Generally speaking, the larger the gap\nbetween skeleton guidance and original images produced by\nthe frozen SD branch, the higher discrepancy between the\ngiven guidance and generated human images. Moreover,\nthe inference cost of these dual-branch solutions largely in-\ncreases compared to the original SD model.\nIn contrast to employing an additional trainable branch\nfor controllable HIG, this work proposes a native skeleton-\nguided diffusion model, named HumanSD . By directly \ufb01ne-\ntuning the SD model [35] with skeleton conditions concate-\nnated to the noisy latent embeddings, as shown in Figure\n2 (a), HumanSD can natively guide image generation with\nthe desired pose, instead of conducting a challenging imageediting task. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting effects\ncaused by model over\ufb01tting during \ufb01ne-tuning, we propose\na novel heatmap-guided denoising loss for diffusion mod-\nels to disentangle between conditioned humans and uncon-\nditioned backgrounds in the training stage. Such a disen-\ntanglement forces the \ufb01ne-tuning process to concentrate on\nthe generation of foreground humans while minimizing un-\nexpected overrides of the pre-trained SD model parameters\nthat hurt the model\u2019s generation and generalization abilities.\nBesides the algorithm, training data is another important\nfactor determining model performance [38]. To improve\nthe HIG quality of HumanSD , we \ufb01ne-tune our model on\nthree large-scale human-centric datasets containing high-\nquality images and the corresponding 2D skeletal infor-\nmation and text descriptions: GHI,LAION-Human , and\nHuman-Art .

While traditional manual\nauthoring of digital characters often involves cumbersome\nand time-consuming efforts from skilled artists, the recent\nprogress in human digitization has shown exciting potential\ntowards more user-friendly solutions. Nevertheless, avatar\ngeneration still faces a set of tough challenges. First of all,\nintuitive control is highly coveted for the system to under-\nstand specific user needs in the most natural form. Second,\nthe generated avatars should be immediately ready for ap-\nplications such as view synthesis, scene composition, and\nretargetable animation. Finally, the avatars should be of\nhigh quality, considering both the overall visual fidelity and\npreservation of target styles or identities in geometry and\ntexture, especially when being manipulated or animated.\nSignificant efforts have been made in search of natu-\nral user controls for avatars. One representative stream of\nworks [7, 2, 11, 47, 52, 51, 50] takes reference images\nto stylize an avatar. Unfortunately, finding suitable refer-\nences that perfectly match the desired shape and appear-\nance is not always easy, substantially limiting real-world\nuse. On the other hand, text prompts are attracting more\nattention as a more natural control for generating high-\nquality 3D avatars, with the recent advances in large-scale\nvision-language models. In particular, text-to-3D avatar\ncreation [16, 56, 31, 53] is explored by leveraging the zero-\nshot generation ability of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-\nTraining (CLIP) [41]. Following this trend, our work also\ntackles the problem of text-guided avatar creation. In par-\nticular, we aim at high-quality 3D avatar generation, which\nnot only supports static view synthesis but also allows for\ncontrollable animation.\nText-driven avatar creation poses great challenges in pro-\n1arXiv:2303.17606v2  [cs.CV]  21 Aug 2023ducing high-quality geometry and texture while providing\nflexible animation capabilities.

Limitations\nWhile Fantasia3D demonstrates promising advance-\nments in the realm of generating photorealistic 3D assets\nfrom text prompts, several limitations remain. For instance,\nwhile our method successfully produces loose visual ef-\nfects, it remains a significant challenge to generate cor-\nresponding loose geometries, such as hair, fur, and grass,\nsolely based on text prompts. Additionally, our method pri-\nmarily emphasizes object generation, thereby lacking the\ncapacity to generate complete scenes with background from\ntext prompts. Consequently, our future research endeavors\nwill be dedicated to addressing these limitations by focus-\ning on the generation of complete scenes and intricate loose\ngeometries.\n7. Experiments\nIn this section, we present comprehensive Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present Fantasia3D, a new method for\nautomatic text-to-3D generation. Fantasia3D uses disentan-\ngled modeling and learning of geometry and appearance,\nand is able to generate both the fine surface and rich mate-\nrial/texture. Fantasia3D is based on the hybrid scene repre-\nsentation of DMT ET. For geometry learning, we propose to\nencode a rendered normal map, and use shape encoding of\nthe normal as the input of the pre-trained, stable diffusion\nmodel. For appearance modeling, we introduce the spatially\nvarying BRDF into the text-to-3D task, thus enabling ma-\nterial learning that supports photorealistic rendering of the\nlearned surface. Expect for text prompts, our method can\nbe triggered with a customized 3D shape as well; this is\nflexible for users to better control what content is to be gen-\nerated. Our method is also convenient to support relighting,\nediting, and physical simulation of the generated 3D assets.\nOur method is based on pre-trained image diffusion mod-\nels (i.e., the stable diffusion). In future research, we are\ninterested in learning 3D diffusion directly", " Introduction\n\u201cThe in\ufb01nite use of \ufb01nite means. \u201d\n\u2013 Noam Chomsky (Chomsky, 1965)\nGenerative image models conditioned on text can now\nproduce photorealistic and diverse images (Ramesh et al.,\n1Alibaba Group2Ant Group.

To further achieve\ncustomized generation, many recent works extend the text-\nto-image models by introducing conditions such as segmen-\ntation maps (Rombach et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b;\nCouairon et al., 2022), scene graphs (Yang et al., 2022),\nsketches (V oynov et al., 2022), depthmaps (stability.ai,\n2022), and inpainting masks (Xie et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\n2022a), or by \ufb01netuning the pretrained models on a few\nsubject-speci\ufb01c data (Gal et al., 2022; Mokady et al., 2022;\nRuiz et al., 2022). Nevertheless, these models still provide\nonly a limited degree of controllability for designers when\nit comes to using them for practical applications. For\nexample, generative models often struggle to accurately\nproduce images with speci\ufb01cations for semantics, shape,\nstyle, and color all at once, which is common in real-world\ndesign projects.\nWe argue that the key to controllable image generation\nrelies not only on conditioning, but even more signi\ufb01cantly\noncompositionality (Lake et al., 2017). The latter can\nexponentially expand the control space by introducing an\nenormous number of potential combinations ( e.g.,a hundred\nimages with eight representations each yield about 1008\ncombinations). Similar concepts are explored in the \ufb01elds\nof language and scene understanding (Keysers et al., 2019;\nJohnson et al., 2016), where the compositionality is termed\ncompositional generalization , the skill of recognizing or\ngenerating a potentially in\ufb01nite number of novel combina-\ntions from a limited number of known components.\nIn this work, we build upon the above idea and present\nComposer, a realization of compositional generative models .\nBycompositional generative models , we refer to generative\nmodels that are capable of seamlessly recombining visual\ncomponents to produce new images (Figure 1). Speci\ufb01cally,\nwe implement Composer as a multi-conditional diffusion\nmodel with a UNet backbone (Nichol et al., 2021). At every\ntraining iteration of Composer, there are two phases: in the\ndecomposition phase, we break down images in a batch into\nindividual representations using computer vision algorithms\nor pretrained models; whereas in the composition phase, we\noptimize Composer so that it can reconstruct these images\nfrom their representation subsets.

Our system,\nwhich we call PersonNeRF enables us to render the subject\nunder novel unobserved combinations of camera viewpoint,\nbody pose, and appearance.\nFree-viewpoint rendering from unstructured photos is a\nparticularly challenging task because a photo collection can\ncontain images at different times where the subject has dif-\nferent clothing and appearance. Furthermore, we only have\naccess to a handful of images for each appearance, so it is\nunlikely that all regions of the body would be well-observed\nfor any given appearance. In addition, any given body pose\nis likely observed from just a single or very few camera\nviewpoints.\nWe address this challenging scenario of sparse viewpoint\nand pose observations with changing appearance by mod-\neling a single canonical-pose neural volumetric represen-\ntation that uses a shared motion weight \ufb01eld to describe\nhow the canonical volume deforms with changes in body\npose, all conditioned on appearance-dependent latent vec-\ntors. Our key insight is that although the observed body\nposes have different appearances across the photo collec-\ntion, they should all be explained by a common motion\nmodel since they all come from the same person. Further-\nmore, although the appearances of a subject can vary across\nthe photo collection, they all share common properties such\nas symmetry so embedding appearance in a shared latent\nspace can help the model learn useful priors.\nTo this end, we build our work on top of Human-\nNeRF [46], which is a state-of-the-art free-viewpoint hu-\nman rendering approach that requires hundreds of images\nof a subject without clothing or appearance changes. Along\nwith regularization, we extend HumanNeRF to account for\nsparse observations as well as enable modeling diverse ap-\npearances. Finally, we build an entire personalized space\nspanned by camera view, body pose, and appearance that\nallows intuitive exploration of arbitrary novel combinations\nof these attributes (as shown in Fig. 1).\n2. Related Work\n3D reconstruction from unstructured photos Recon-\nstructing static scenes from unstructured photo collections\nis a longstanding research problem in the \ufb01elds of com-\nputer vision and graphics. The seminal Photo Tourism sys-\ntem [39] applies large-scale structure-from-motion [36] to\ntourist photos of famous sites, enabling interactive naviga-\ntion of the 3D scene. Subsequent works leveraged multi-\nview stereo [10, 37] to increase the 3D reconstruction qual-\nity [1, 38]. Recently, this problem has been revisited withneural rendering [19, 30, 40, 43, 44]. In particular, Neu-\nral Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [32] have enabled photoreal-\nistic view synthesis results in\nFID in Table 3 and visually compare them with Human-\nNeRF [46] in Fig. 9. The quality improvement over the Methods have reconstructed neural \ufb01eld\nrepresentations of humans from a variety of different inputs,\nincluding 3D scans [4, 23, 31, 35, 45], multi-view RGB ob-\nservations [18, 21, 34], RGB-D sequences [8], or monoc-\nular videos [13, 46]. Our work is most closely related to\nHumanNeRF [46], which reconstructs a volumetric neural\n\ufb01eld from a monocular video of a moving human. We build\nupon this representation and extend it to enable reconstruct-\ning a neural volumetric model from unstructured photo col-\nlections with diverse poses and appearances.\n3.

With the advent\nof text-to-image diffusion models [ 54,62,72], we can now\ncreate visually stunning images by typing in a text prompt.\nYet, text-to-image models are limited in the control they\nprovide over the spatial composition of the image; precisely\nexpressing complex layouts, poses, shapes and forms can be\ndifficult via text prompts alone. Generating an image that\naccurately matches our mental imagery often requires nu-\nmerous trial-and-error cycles of editing a prompt, inspecting\nthe resulting images and then re-editing the prompt.\nCan we enable finer grained spatial control by letting\nusers provide additional images that directly specify their\ndesired image composition? In computer vision and machine\nlearning, these additional images ( e.g., edge maps, human\npose skeletons, segmentation maps, depth, normals, etc.)\nare often treated as conditioning on the image generation\nprocess. Image-to-image translation models [ 34,98] learnarXiv:2302.05543v3  [cs.CV]  26 Nov 2023the mapping from conditioning images to target images. The\nresearch community has also taken steps to control text-\nto-image models with spatial masks [ 6,20], image editing\ninstructions [ 10], personalization via finetuning [ 21,75],etc.\nWhile a few problems ( e.g., generating image variations,\ninpainting) can be resolved with training-free techniques\nlike constraining the denoising diffusion process or edit-\ning attention layer activations, a wider variety of problems\nlike depth-to-image, pose-to-image, etc., require end-to-end\nlearning and data-driven solutions.\nLearning conditional controls for large text-to-image dif-\nfusion models in an end-to-end way is challenging. The\namount of training data for a specific condition may be sig-\nnificantly smaller than the data available for general text-to-\nimage training. For instance, the largest datasets for various\nspecific problems ( e.g., object shape/normal, human pose\nextraction, etc.) are usually about 100K in size, which is\n50,000 times smaller than the LAION-5B [ 79] dataset that\nwas used to train Stable Diffusion [ 82]. The direct finetun-\ning or continued training of a large pretrained model with\nlimited data may cause overfitting and catastrophic forget-\nting [ 31,75]. Researchers have shown that such forgetting\ncan be alleviated by restricting the number or rank of train-\nable parameters [ 14,25,31,92]. For our problem, designing\ndeeper or more customized neural architectures might be\nnecessary for handling in-the-wild conditioning images with\ncomplex shapes and diverse high-level semantics.\nThis paper presents ControlNet, an end-to-end neural\nnetwork architecture that learns conditional controls for large\npretrained text-to-image diffusion models (Stable Diffusion\nin our implementation). ControlNet preserves the quality\nand capabilities of the large model by locking its parameters,\nand also making a trainable copy of its encoding layers.\nThis architecture treats the large pretrained model as a strong\nbackbone for learning diverse conditional controls. The\ntrainable copy and the original, locked model are connected\nwith zero convolution layers, with weights initialized to zeros\nso that they progressively grow during the training. This\narchitecture ensures that harmful noise is not added to the\ndeep features of the large diffusion model at the beginning\nof training, and protects the large-scale pretrained backbone\nin the trainable copy from being damaged by such noise.\nOur experiments verify that Con-\ntrolNet can effectively control Stable Diffusion with single\nor multiple conditions, with or without prompts.

Over the past \ufb01ve years, neural architec-\ntures for natural language processing [8, 42], vision [10]\nand several other domains have largely been subsumed by\ntransformers [60]. Many classes of image-level genera-\ntive models remain holdouts to the trend, though\u2014while\ntransformers see widespread use in autoregressive mod-\nels [3,6,43,47], they have seen less adoption in other gener-\native modeling frameworks.

Performance steadily improves in FID as model \ufb02ops increase.\nRight: Our best model, DiT-XL/2, is compute-ef\ufb01cient and outperforms all prior U-Net-based diffusion models, like ADM and LDM.\nThe seminal work of Ho et al. [19] \ufb01rst introduced the\nU-Net backbone for diffusion models. Having initially seen\nsuccess within pixel-level autoregressive models and con-\nditional GANs [23], the U-Net was inherited from Pixel-\nCNN++ [52, 58] with a few changes. The model is con-\nvolutional, comprised primarily of ResNet [15] blocks. In\ncontrast to the standard U-Net [49], additional spatial self-\nattention blocks, which are essential components in trans-\nformers, are interspersed at lower resolutions. Dhariwal and\nNichol [9] ablated several architecture choices for the U-\nNet, such as the use of adaptive normalization layers [40] to\ninject conditional information and channel counts for con-\nvolutional layers. However, the high-level design of the U-\nNet from Ho et al. has largely remained intact.\nWith this work, we aim to demystify the signi\ufb01cance of\narchitectural choices in diffusion models and offer empiri-\ncal baselines for future generative modeling research. We\nshow that the U-Net inductive bias is notcrucial to the per-\nformance of diffusion models, and they can be readily re-\nplaced with standard designs such as transformers. As a\nresult, diffusion models are well-poised to bene\ufb01t from the\nrecent trend of architecture uni\ufb01cation\u2014e.g., by inheriting\nbest practices and training recipes from other domains, as\nwell as retaining favorable properties like scalability, ro-\nbustness and ef\ufb01ciency. A standardized architecture would\nalso open up new possibilities for cross-domain research.\nIn this paper, we focus on a new class of diffusion models\nbased on transformers. We call them Diffusion Transform-\ners, or DiTs for short. DiTs adhere to the best practices of\nVision Transformers (ViTs) [10], which have been shown to\nscale more effectively for visual recognition than traditional\nconvolutional networks (e.g., ResNet [15]).More speci\ufb01cally, we study the scaling behavior of trans-\nformers with respect to network complexity vs. sample\nquality . We show that by constructing and benchmark-\ning the DiT design space under the Latent Diffusion Mod-\nels(LDMs) [48] framework, where diffusion models are\ntrained within a V AE\u2019s latent space, we can successfully\nreplace the U-Net backbone with a transformer.

Language corpora on the web led to large language\nmodels like GPT-3 [4]; paired image and text datasets like\nConceptual Captions [68] led to vision-and-language pre-\ntrained models like VilBERT [45]; YouTube video datasets\nled to video capable models like Merlot-Reserve [87]; and\nmassive multimodal datasets like WebImageText [70] and\nLAION [66, 67] led to models like CLIP [60] and StableD-\niffusion [64]. These leaps in dataset scale and diversity were\ntriggered by moving from manually curated datasets to har-\nnessing the power of the web and its creative content.\nIn contrast to the datasets described above, the size of\n1arXiv:2212.08051v1  [cs.CV]  15 Dec 2022the datasets we are feeding to our, data-hungry, deep learn-\ning models in many other areas of research is simply not\ncomparable. For instance, the number of 3D assets used\nin training generative 3D models is, maximally, on the or-\nder of thousands [24] and the simulators used to train em-\nbodied AI models typically have only between a few dozen\nto a thousand unique scenes [39, 42, 63, 72]. The startling\nadvances brought about by developing large-scale datasets\nfor images, videos, and natural language, demand that an\nequivalent dataset be built for 3D assets.\nWe present O BJAVERSE 1.0, a large scale corpus of high-\nquality, richly annotated, 3D objects; see Fig. 1. Objects\nin our dataset are free to use1and sourced from Sketch-\nfab, a leading online platform for managing, viewing, and\ndistributing 3D models. In total, O BJAVERSE contains\nover 800K 3D assets designed by over 100K artists which\nmakes this data large and diversely sourced. Assets not\nonly belong to varied categories like animals, humans, and\nvehicles, but also include interiors and exteriors of large\nspaces that can be used, e.g., to train embodied agents.\nOBJAVERSE is a universe of rich 3D data with detailed\nmetadata that can support many different annotations to en-\nable new applications. With this remarkable increase in\nscale, we see an incredible opportunity for O BJAVERSE to\nimpact research progress across domains.

Speech-to-Motion Datasets\nThe existing speech-to-motion datasets can be roughly\ncategorized as in-house and in-the-wild. The annotations of\nin-house datasets [ 15,19,23,55,60] are accurate but are\nlimited in scale since the multi-camera systems used for data\ncapture are expensive and labor intensive. Moreover, these\ndatasets only provide annotations of the head [ 15,19,60]\nor body [ 23,55], and thus do not support whole-body gen-\neration. To learn richer and more diverse speaking styles\nand emotions, [ 66,67] propose to use in-the-wild videos.\nThe annotations are pseudo ground truth (p-GT) given by ad-\nvanced reconstruction approaches, e.g.[10].

The key insight is to interpret diffusion models as\n* Equal contribution.learned predictors of a gradient \ufb01eld, often referred to as the\nscore function of the data log-likelihood. We apply the chain\nrule on the estimated score, hence the name Score Jacobian\nChaining (SJC).\nFollowing Hyv\u00e4rinen and Dayan [15], the score is de\ufb01ned\nas the gradient of the log-density function with respect to the\ndata. Diffusion models of various families [ 12,49,51,53]\ncan all be interpreted [ 18,21,53] as modelingrxlogp\u001b(x)\ni.e. the denoising score at noise level \u001b. For readability, we\nrefer to the denoising score as the score. Generating a sam-\nple from a diffusion model involves repeated evaluations\nof the score function from large to small \u001blevel, so that a\nsamplexgradually moves closer to the data manifold. It\ncan be loosely interpreted as gradient descent, with precise\ncontrol on the step sizes so that data distribution evolves to\nmatch the annealed \u001blevel (ancestral sampler [ 12], SDE and\nprobability-\ufb02ow ODE [ 53], etc.). While there are other per-\nspectives to a diffusion model [ 12,49], here we are primarily\nmotivated from the viewpoint that diffusion models produce\na gradient \ufb01eld.\nA natural question to ask is whether the chain rule can be\napplied to the learned gradients. Consider a diffusion model\non images. An image xmay be parameterized by some\n1arXiv:2212.00774v1  [cs.CV]  1 Dec 2022functionfwith parameters \u0012,i.e.,x=f(\u0012). Applying the\nchain rule through the Jacobian@x\n@\u0012converts a gradient on\nimagexinto a gradient on the parameter \u0012. There are many\npotential use cases for pairing a pretrained diffusion model\nwith different choices of f. In this work we are interested\nin exploring the connection between 3D and multiview 2D\nby choosing fto be a differentiable renderer, thus creating a\n3D generative model using only pretrained 2D resources.\nMany prior works [ 2,58,60] perform 3D generative mod-\neling by training on 3D datasets [ 5,23,55,59]. This ap-\nproach is often as challenging as it is format-ambiguous. In\naddition to the high data acquisition cost of 3D assets [ 9],\nthere is no universal data format: point clouds, meshes, volu-\nmetric radiance \ufb01eld, etc, all have computational trade-offs.\nWhat is common to these 3D assets is that they can be ren-\ndered into 2D images. An inverse rendering system, or a\ndifferentiable renderer [ 24,26,29,34,39], provides access\nto the Jacobian J\u0019,@x\u0019\n@\u0012of a rendered image x\u0019at camera\nviewpoint\u0019with respect to the underlying 3D parameteriza-\ntion\u0012. Our method uses differentiable rendering to aggregate\n2D image gradients over multiple viewpoints into a 3D asset\ngradient, and lifts a generative model from 2D to 3D. We\nparameterize a 3D asset \u0012as a radiance \ufb01eld stored on voxels\nand choosefto be the volume rendering function.\nA key technical challenge is that computing the 2D score\nby directly evaluating a diffusion model on a rendered image\nx\u0019leads to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. Gener-\nally, diffusion models are trained as denoisers and have only\nseen noisy inputs during training. On the other hand, our\nmethod requires evaluating the denoiser on non-noisy ren-\ndered images from a 3D asset during optimization, and it\nleads to the OOD problem. To address the issue, we propose\nPerturb-and-Average Scoring , an approach to estimate the\nscore for non-noisy images.\nEmpirically, we \ufb01rst validate the effectiveness", " Introduction\n3D digital content has been in high demand for a variety\nof applications, including gaming, entertainment, architec-\nture, and robotics simulation.

Developing these skill sets takes a significant amount\nof time and effort. Augmenting 3D content creation with\nnatural language could considerably help democratize 3D\ncontent creation for novices and turbocharge expert artists.\n*\u2020: equal contribution.Image content creation from text prompts [2, 30, 35, 38]\nhas seen significant progress with the advances of diffusion\nmodels [13, 43, 44] for generative modeling of images. The\nkey enablers are large-scale datasets comprising billions\nof samples (images with text) scrapped from the Internet\nand massive amounts of compute. In contrast, 3D content\ngeneration has progressed at a much slower pace. Existing\n3D object generation models [4,9,49] are mostly categorical.\nA trained model can only be used to synthesize objects for a\nsingle class, with early signs of scaling to multiple classes\nshown recently by Zeng et al. [49]. Therefore, what a user\ncan do with these models is extremely limited and not yet\nready for artistic creation. This limitation is largely due to the\nlack of diverse large-scale 3D datasets \u2014 compared to image\nand video content, 3D content is much less accessible on the\nInternet. This naturally raises the question of whether 3D\ngeneration capability can be achieved by leveraging powerful\ntext-to-image generative models.\nRecently, DreamFusion [33] demonstrated its remarkable\nability for text-conditioned 3D content generation by uti-\nlizing a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model [38] that\ngenerates images as a strong image prior. The diffusion\nmodel acts as a critic to optimize the underlying 3D repre-\nsentation. The optimization process ensures that rendered\nimages from a 3D model, represented by Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) [25], match the distribution of photorealis-\ntic images across different viewpoints, given the input text\nprompt. Since the supervision signal in DreamFusion oper-\nates on very low-resolution images ( 64\u00d764), DreamFusion\ncannot synthesize high-frequency 3D geometric and texture\ndetails. Due to the use of inefficient MLP architectures for\nthe NeRF representation, practical high-resolution synthesis\nmay not even be possible as the required memory footprint\nand the computation budget grows quickly with the resolu-\ntion. Even at a resolution of 64\u00d764, optimization times are\nin hours (1.5 hours per prompt on average using TPUv4).\nIn this paper, we present a method that can synthesize\nhighly detailed 3D models from text prompts within a re-\nduced computation time.

These breakthroughs have\nalso resulted in fast progression for text-guided shape gen-\neration [9,29,53]. Most recently, it has been shown [35] that\none can directly use score distillation from a 2D diffusion\nmodel to guide the generation of a 3D object represented as\na Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [30].\nWhile Text-to-3D can generate impressive results in a fast and \ufb02exible object gener-\nation framework. We then introduced shape-guided con-\ntrol on the generated model. We showed two versions of\nshape-guided generation, Sketch-Shape and Latent-Paint,\nand demonstrated their effectiveness for providing addi-\ntional control over the generation process.\nTypically, the notion of rendering refers to generating an\nimage in pixel space. Here, we have presented a method that\nrenders directly into the latent space of a neural model. We\nbelieve that our Latent-NeRF approach opens the avenue for\nmore latent space rendering Related Work\n3D Shape Generation 3D shape synthesis is a long-\nstanding problem in computer graphics and computer vi-\nsion. In recent years, with the emergence of neural net-\nworks, the research in 3D modeling has immensely ad-\nvanced. The most conventional supervision type is applied\ndirectly with 3D shapes, through different representations\nsuch as implicit functions [10, 20, 33], meshes [19, 50] or\npoint clouds [27, 49]. As 3D supervision is often dif\ufb01cult\nto obtain, other works use images to guide the generative\ntask [6, 7, 32]. In fact, even when 3D data is available, 2D\nrenderings are sometimes chosen as the supervising primi-\ntive [5, 8, 18]. For example, in GET3D [18], two generators\nare trained, one generates a 3D SDF, and the other a texture\n\ufb01eld. The output textured mesh is then obtained in a dif-\nferentiable manner by utilizing DMTet [42]. These gener-\nators are adversarially trained with a dataset of 2D images.\nIn [47] a diffusion model has been used to generate multiple\nviews of a given input image. Yet, it has been trained in a\nsupervised manner on a multi-view dataset, unlike our work\nwhich does not require a dataset.Text-to-3D with 2D Supervision Recently, the success\nof text-guided synthesis in numerous domains [1, 2, 17, 34,\n44], has motivated a surge of works that use Language-\nImage models to guide 3D scenes representations. CLIP-\nForge [41] consists of two separate components, an im-\nplicit autoencoder conditioned on shape codes, and a nor-\nmalizing \ufb02ow model that is trained to generate shape codes\naccording to CLIP embeddings. CLIP-Forge exploits the\nfact that CLIP has a joint text-image embedding space to\ntrain on image embeddings and infer on text embeddings,\nachieving text-to-shape capabilities.

TANGO [9] follows a similar opti-\nmization scheme, while improving background NeRF.\nRGB Re\ufb01nement Using Latent-NeRF, one may success-\nfully learn to represent 3D scenes even when optimizing\nsolely in latent space. Still, in some cases, it could be ben-\ne\ufb01cial to further re\ufb01ne the model by \ufb01ne-tuning it in pixel\nspace, and have the NeRF model operate directly in RGB.\nTo do so, we must convert the NeRF that was trained in la-\ntent space to a NeRF that operates in RGB. This requires\nconverting the MLP\u2019s output from the", " Introduction\nLearning from multimodal data such as text, images, and audio is a longstanding research challenge\nin machine learning [ 31,51,56,83,86]. Recently, contrastive loss functions combined with large\nneural networks have led to breakthroughs in the generalization capabilities of vision and language\nmodels [ 58,59,66]. For instance, OpenAI\u2019s CLIP models [ 58] achieved large gains in zero-shot\nclassi\ufb01cation on ImageNet [ 65], improving from the prior top-1 accuracy of 11.5% [ 41] to 76.2%.\n1Project page: https://laion.ai/laion-5b-a-new-era-of-open-large-scale-multi-modal-datasets/\n1arXiv:2210.08402v1  [cs.CV]  16 Oct 2022In addition, CLIP achieved unprecedented performance gains on multiple challenging distribution\nshifts [3,23,61,70,78,82]. Inspired by CLIP\u2019s performance, numerous groups have further improved\nimage-text models by increasing the amount of computation and the training set size [ 28,54,89,94].\nAnother recent success of multimodal learning is in image generation, where DALL-E [ 59] and later\nmodels [52,60,64,66,90] demonstrated the potential of text-guided image generation by producing\nhigh-quality images speci\ufb01c to the provided text.\nA critical ingredient in this new generation of image-text models is the pre-training dataset. All of\nthe aforementioned advances rely on large datasets containing hundreds of millions or even billions\nof image-text pairs, e.g., 400 million for CLIP [ 58] and 6.6 billion for BASIC [ 54]. However, none\nof these datasets are publicly available . While OpenAI still released the CLIP models publicly [ 58],\nlater papers made neither the pre-training dataset nor the resulting models available to the wider\nresearch community [ 2,28,52,54,66,89,90]. As a result, research in this area has pooled into a\nsmall number of industrial research labs, limiting transparency and impeding research progress.\nIn this work, we address this challenge and make multimodal training more accessible by assembling\na public dataset that is suitable for training large image-text models. Speci\ufb01cally, we introduce\nLAION-5B, the largest public image-text dataset containing over 5.8 billion examples (see Table 1 for\na comparison). By starting from Common Crawl [1] and \ufb01ltering this data source with an existing\nCLIP model, we derive a dataset consisting of three parts: 2.32 billion English image-text examples,\n2.26 billion multilingual examples, and 1.27 billion examples that are not speci\ufb01c to a particular\nlanguage (e.g., places, products, etc.). Beyond assembling the dataset, we also explore its ethical\nimplications and \ufb02aws that emerge with large-scale data collection. By releasing LAION-5B publicly,\nwe o\ufb00er the \ufb01rst opportunity for the community to audit and re\ufb01ne a dataset of this magnitude.\nViT-B/32 ViT-B/16 ViT-L/14\nCLIP Vision Model010203040506070ImageNet1k Accuracy (%)Zero-Shot ImageNet1k Accuracy by Model and Dataset\nLAION-400M (Ours)\nCLIP WIT (OpenAI)\nFigure 1: Zero-Shot Accuracy.

An epitome of this revolution is the\nvolumetric recording and playback of 4D (space-time) human perfor-\nmances that subsequently allows a user to watch the performance\nimmersively in virtual environments. Specifically, a user can interact\nwith the performer as if they were physically present, as simple as\nmoving about to change perspectives and as sophisticated as edit-\ning the contents at her fingertips. By far, the most widely adopted\nworkflow to produce volumetric human performance is still to re-\nconstruct and track a dynamic mesh with a per-frame texture map.\nSignificant advances, classic and learning-based, have been made on\nreconstruction algorithms in both academia [Collet et al .2015; Dou\net al.2017; Sch\u00f6nberger and Frahm 2016] and industry [Metastage\n2019; PhotoScan 2019], perhaps symbolized by the acquisition of\nCapturing Reality by Epic Games. In reality, either photogrammetric\nor 3D scanning-based reconstructions are still time-consuming and\nremain vulnerable to occlusions and lack of textures which causes\nholes and noise. Fixing the final reconstructed sequence to meet\nthe minimal immersive viewing requirement demands excessive\ncleanup works by experienced artists.\nRecent neural advances [Lombardi et al .2019; Tewari et al .2020;\nWu et al .2020] attempt to bypass explicit reconstructions and instead\nfocus on synthesizing photo-realistic novel views. Most notably, the\nNeural Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al .2020] replaces the\ntraditional notion of geometry and appearance with a single MLP\nnetwork where rendering individual pixels in any new camera view\nmaps to per-ray network inference. The original NeRF and its accel-\neration schemes [M\u00fcller et al .2022; Yu et al .2021a] mainly focus\non static scenes whereas more recent approaches [Peng et al .2021b;Tretschk et al .2020; Zhang et al .2021; Zhao et al .2022] aim to extend\nsuch neural representations to dynamic scenes with time as a latent\nvariable. Brute-force training and rendering strategies are inefficient\nand real-time rendering, in particular, requires striking an intricate\nbalance between space [M\u00fcller et al .2022; Sara Fridovich-Keil and\nAlex Yu et al .2022; Yu et al .2021a] and quality [Suo et al .2021;\nWang et al .2022]. In the context of animatable human avatars, it\nis also possible to produce neural characters by imposing paramet-\nric human models as priors [Bagautdinov et al .2021; Habermann\net al.2021; Liu et al .2021; Xiang et al .2021]. Yet, their final quality\nrelies heavily on pre-scanned or parametric templates and tedious\ntime-consuming per-actor training.\nAnother major challenge with neural approaches is that their results. Given the \ud835\udc5f, we sort the\nvertices by Y-axis and pick the ED node when it is outside \ud835\udc5ffrom the\nset of existing ED nodes. Besides, we can link the ED nodes when\nthey influence the same vertices and then construct the ED graph\nin advance for subsequent optimization.\nNetwork Architecture. The key of our refinement stage includes\nthe canonical radiance field \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc5cand the deformation network \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc51.\nSpecifically, \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc5chas the same network architecture as Instant-NGP\nconsisting of the three-dimensional hash encoding and two con-\ncatenated MLPs, density and color. 3-dimensional coordinates are\nmapped to 64-dimensional features by hash encoding as the input to\nthe density MLP. Then, the density MLP has a 2-hidden-layer(with\n64 hidden dimensions) and outputs a 1-dimension density and 15-\ndimensions geometry features. The geometry features are concate-\nnated with the direction encoding and are fed into the color MLP\nwhich", " Introduction\nMultimodal learning has come into prominence recently, with text-to-image synthesis [ 53,12,57]\nand image-text contrastive learning [ 49,31,74] at the forefront. These models have transformed\nthe research community and captured widespread public attention with creative image generation\n[22,54] and editing applications [ 21,41,34]. To pursue this research direction further, we introduce\nImagen, a text-to-image diffusion model that combines the power of transformer language models\n(LMs) [ 15,52] with high-\ufb01delity diffusion models [ 28,29,16,41] to deliver an unprecedented\ndegree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding in text-to-image synthesis. In\ncontrast to prior work that uses only image-text data for model training [e.g., 53,41], the key \ufb01nding\nbehind Imagen is that text embeddings from large LMs [ 52,15], pretrained on text-only corpora, are\nremarkably effective for text-to-image synthesis. See Fig. 1 for select samples.\nImagen comprises a frozen T5-XXL [ 52] encoder to map input text into a sequence of embeddings\nand a 64\u000264image diffusion model, followed by two super-resolution diffusion models for generating\n\u0003Equal contribution.\nyCore contribution.arXiv:2205.11487v1  [cs.CV]  23 May 2022Sprouts in the shape of text \u2018Imagen\u2019 coming out of a\nfairytale book.\nA photo of a Shiba Inu dog with a backpack riding a\nbike.

Within this framework, CLIP [ 39] has\nemerged as a successful representation learner for images. CLIP embeddings have a number of\ndesirable properties: they are robust to image distribution shift, have impressive zero-shot capabilities,\nand have been \ufb01ne-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art results). We also plot the aesthetic quality against Recall5, since guidance typically induces a trade-off\n5Recall is computed with respect to the training dataset.\n13Real Image\n DALL-E\n GLIDE\n Make-A-Scene\n unCLIP\n unCLIP (prod.)\n\u201ca green train is coming\ndown the tracks\u201d\u201ca group of skiers are\npreparing to ski down\na mountain.\u201d\u201ca small kitchen with\na low ceiling\u201d\u201ca group of elephants\nwalking in muddy\nwater.\u201d\u201ca living area with a\ntelevision and a table\u201d\nFigure 12: Random image samples on MS-COCO prompts.\n141.01.52.02.53.03.54.0\nguidance scale4.604.654.704.754.804.85mean AVA predictionGLIDE\nunCLIP (AR)\nunCLIP (diffusion)\n4.60 4.65 4.70 4.75 4.80 4.85\nmean AVA prediction0.4500.4750.5000.5250.5500.5750.600recall\nGLIDE\nunCLIP (AR)\nunCLIP (diffusion)Figure 13: Aesthetic quality evaluations comparing GLIDE and unCLIP using 512 auto-generated artistic\nprompts.

Interestingly, we \ufb01nd that guiding unCLIP does not decrease Recall while still\nimproving aesthetic quality according to this metric.\n6 methods, unCLIP produces realistic scenes that capture the text prompts.\n5.5 Aesthetic Quality Comparison\nWe additionally perform automated aesthetic quality evaluations comparing unCLIP to GLIDE. Our goal with\nthis evaluation is to assess how well each model produces artistic illustrations and photographs. To this end,\nwe generated 512 \u201cartistic\u201d captions using GPT-3 [ 4] by prompting it with captions for existing artwork (both\nreal and AI generated). Next, we trained a CLIP linear probe to predict human aesthetic judgments using\nthe A V A dataset [ 33] ( Appendix A). For each model and set of sampling hyperparameters, we produce four\nimages for each prompt, and report the mean predicted aesthetic judgment over the full batch of 2048 images.\nIn Figure 13, we present experiments in this paper were trained with the hyperparameters described\nbelow, unless otherwise noted. We additionally trained a production version of unCLIP using similarly\nsized models but with modi\ufb01ed architectures and trained for longer; we include changes to accommodate\nproduct and safety requirements (e.g. inpainting, preventing unwanted memorization), and train on a larger\ndataset that is \ufb01ltered for aesthetic quality and safety. We report model and training hyperparameters for the\npaper models in Table 3. All models were trained using Adam [ 27] with corrected weight decay [ 29] and\nmomentum\f1= 0:9.\nOur CLIP model uses a ViT-H/16 [ 13] image encoder that consumes 256\u0002256resolution images, and\nhas width 1280 with 32 Transformer [ 53] blocks. The text encoder also follows the architecture described\nin Radford et al. [ 39]: it is a Transformer [ 53] with a causal attention mask, with width 1024 and 24 Trans-\nformer blocks. Both models are trained with learning rate 3\u000210\u00004and SAM [ 15] with\u001a= 0:1, where the\nperturbations are applied independently by the replicas, each of which uses batch size 64. The remaining\nhyperparameters are the same as those reported in Radford et al. [39].\nWhen training the encoder, we sample from the CLIP [ 39] and DALL-E [ 40] datasets (approximately\n650M images in total) with equal probability.

This would greatly increase the use and accessibility\nof developing 3D assets. Furthermore, if the shape generated is in\nthe form of a mesh with corresponding texture maps it would easily\nfacilitate integration with a large suite of existing game engines and\nsoftware that use 3D meshes as primitives.\nA big limitation is the lack of large varied datasets of 3D ob-\njects and corresponding natural language descriptions. For example,\ndatasets such as Shapenet [Chang et al .2015] and CO3D [Reizenstein\net al.2021] provide 50 object categories respectively. In contrast\nthere are large datasets containing rich 2D images with a large vari-\nety of objects. For example Imagenet-21K [Ridnik et al .2021] has\n21,000 object categories. Furthermore, natural image data can often\nbe accompanied by rich textual descriptions. Recently CLIP has been\ntrained on a large dataset of 400 million image text pairs to learn an\naligned visual and textual representation [Radford et al .2021]. This\ntext and image scoring model was trained on text captions with\ncombinations from a set of 500,000 query words, leading to a very\nlarge diversity in the potential objects it can represent.\nWe thus consider utilizing the knowledge from a large scale deep\nlearning model trained only on images and texts. This relies on the\nfact that a 3D shape can be projected to a 2D image from an arbitrary\nviewpoint through rendering. Using a differentiable renderer such\nas [Laine et al .2020] one can obtain images of a shape and then use\nCLIP to get a score between the images and an input text. Leveraging\nthe differentiability of the renderer and CLIP, an inverse problem\ncan be solved by optimizing the shape and texture of a mesh to\nmaximize the CLIP score of rendered images and input prompt.\nHowever, doing this naively can lead to a tangled and noisy mesh\nas there are insufficient constraints on the shape. Therefore we\nincorporate a number of constraints and techniques that allow us to\ngenerate a plausible shape and texture. First we use a regularization\nloss and incorporate limit subdivision to further smooth the mesh.\nEven though this helps us maximize the score it often leads to an\nundesirable result in terms of texture as CLIP may prefer \"painting\"\nsmall artifacts in to the texture rather than deform and globally\ntexture the object. To alleviate this we use multiple augmentations\nto render the object dynamically such that the", " Introduction\nThe quality of novel view synthesis has been dramatically improved since the introduction [27], NeRF has\nbecome a popular way [5] to model scenes and render them from novel views\nthanks to its high quality rendering.

Various high-performance\nimage-based pose estimators [40,51,48,25,30,29] are proposed in the literature,\nbut they are associated with substantial computational costs.\nThere are two main approaches to improving the e\ufb03ciency of human pose\nestimators so that they can be deployed on resource-scarce edge devices (e.g.,\nsmart cameras). A straightforward way to improve the e\ufb03ciency is designing\nmore compact models, such as numerous light-weighted image-level pose esti-\nmators [3,35,21,61,6,60,42,62,4,18,54] (see Fig. 1(a)(i)) and video-level pose esti-\nmators [41,9] (see Fig. 1(a)(ii)) introduced in previous literature. However, when\nestimating on a video, such approaches inevitably lead to a sub-optimal solu-\ntion for e\ufb03ciency improvement due to the frame-by-frame estimation scheme.\nIn contrast, a promising but rarely explored direction is leveraging the semantic\nredundancy among frames of videos, where we can feed only keyframes to heavyarXiv:2203.08713v2  [cs.CV]  20 Jul 20222 A.

Kucherenko, T., Beskow, J., Kjellstr\u00a8 om, H.:", " INTRODUCTION\nComputer graphics primitives are fundamentally represented by\nmathematical functions that parameterize appearance. The quality\nand performance characteristics of the mathematical representation\nare crucial for visual fidelity: we desire representations that remain\nfast and compact while capturing high-frequency, local detail. Func-\ntions represented by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), used as neural\ngraphics primitives , have been shown to match these criteria (to\nvarying degree), for example as representations of shape [Martel\net al.2021; Park et al .2019] and radiance fields [Liu et al .2020;\nMildenhall et al. 2020; M\u00fcller et al. 2020, 2021].\nThe important commonality of the these approaches is an encod-\ning that maps neural network inputs to a higher-dimensional space,\nwhich is key for extracting high approximation quality from com-\npact models. Most successful among these encodings are trainable,\ntask-specific data structures [Liu et al .2020; Takikawa et al .2021]\nthat take on a large portion of the learning task. This enables the use\nof smaller, more efficient MLPs. However, such data structures rely\non heuristics and structural modifications (such as pruning, split-\nting, or merging) that may complicate the training process, limit\nthe method to a specific task, or limit performance on GPUs where\ncontrol flow and pointer chasing is expensive.\nWe address these concerns with our multiresolution hash encod-\ning, which is adaptive and efficient, independent of the task. It is\nconfigured by just two values\u2014the number of parameters \ud835\udc47and the\ndesired finest resolution \ud835\udc41max\u2014yielding state-of-the-art quality on\na variety of tasks (Figure 1) after a few seconds of training.\nKey to both the task-independent adaptivity and efficiency is a\nmultiresolution hierarchy of hash tables:\n\u2022Adaptivity: we map a cascade of grids to corresponding fixed-\nsize arrays of feature vectors. At coarse resolutions, there is a 1:1\nmapping from grid points to array entries. At fine resolutions, the\narray is treated as a hash table and indexed using a spatial hash\nfunction, where multiple grid points alias each array entry. Such\nhash collisions cause the colliding training gradients to average,\nmeaning that the largest gradients\u2014those most relevant to the\nloss function\u2014will dominate. The hash tables thus automatically\nprioritize the sparse areas with the most important fine scale detail.\nUnlike prior work, no structural updates to the data structure are\nneeded at any point during training.\n\u2022Efficiency: our hash table lookups are O(1)and do not require\ncontrol flow. This maps well to modern GPUs, avoiding execution\ndivergence and serial pointer-chasing inherent in tree traversals.\nThe hash tables for all resolutions may be queried in parallel.\nWe validate our multiresolution hash encoding in four representa-\ntive tasks (see Figure 1):\n(1)Gigapixel image: the MLP learns the mapping from 2D coor-\ndinates to RGB colors of a high-resolution image.\n(2)Neural signed distance functions (SDF): the MLP learns the\nmapping from 3D coordinates to the distance to a surface.\n(3)Neural radiance caching (NRC): the MLP learns the 5D light\nfield of a given scene from a Monte Carlo path tracer.\n(4)Neural radiance and density fields (NeRF): the MLP learns\nthe 3D density and 5D light field of a given scene from image\nobservations and corresponding perspective transforms.In the following, we first review prior neural network encodings\n(Section 2), then we describe our encoding (Section 3) and its imple-\nmentation (Section 4), followed lastly by our experiments. This is 4\u00d7smaller than the batch size chosen in mip-\nNeRF, likely due to the larger number of samples each of their\nrays", " Introduction\nGiven a single video of a human performing an activ-\nity, e.g., a YouTube or TikTok video of a dancer, we would\nlike the ability to pause at any frame and rotate 360 degrees\naround the performer to view them from any angle at that\nmoment in time (Figure 1). This problem \u2013 free-viwepoint\nrendering of a moving subject \u2013 is a longstanding research\nchallenge, as it involves synthesizing previously unseen\ncamera views while accounting for cloth folds, hair move-\nment, and complex body poses [5, 6, 15, 18, 27, 38, 59, 65].\nThe problem is particularly hard for the case of \u201cin-the-\nwild\u201d videos taken with a single camera (monocular video),\nthe case we address in this paper.\nPrevious neural rendering methods that accelerate training of\nneural graphics primitives (e.g., [42]) will help reduce com-\nputation and thus the environmental impact. Finally, our\nmethod will be made available to the public for counter-\nmeasure analysis and computation reduction.Figure 16. Qualitative comparison on the remaining subjects in ZJU-MoCap dataset.\nFigure 17. Optimized canonical appearance on ZJU-MoCap dataset. Related Work\nThe physics of free-viewpoint rendering involves mod-\neling geometry and surface properties and then rendering\nfrom new camera views. However, it remains difficult to\nrecreate complex geometry and subtle lighting effects. Al-\nternatively, image-based rendering [57, 61] offers to render\nnovel views based on given set of views in the image do-\nmain with a large corpus of research over the last couple\ndecades [8, 9, 13, 17, 21, 22, 30, 78].\nHuman specific rendering: The work of Kanade et al.\n[27] is one of the earliest investigations into free-viewpoint\nrendering of humans. It introduced a dome equipped with\ncameras to recover depth maps and meshes, enabling novel\nviews to be rendered by reprojecting and blending differ-\nent views to account for mesh holes due to occlusions.\nLater, Matusik et al. [38] reconstructed a visual hull from\nsilhouettes of the subject and rendered it by carefully se-\nlecting pixels without an auxiliary geometric representation.\nCarranza et al. [5] used a parameterized body model as a\nprior and combined marker-less motion capture and view-\ndependent texturing [13]. Follow-on work introduced non-\nrigid deformation [65], texture warping [6, 72], and various\nrepresentations based on volumes [12] or spheres [59]. Col-\nlet et al. [11] and Guo et al. [18] build a system as well as\npipeline that produces high-quality streamable [11] or even\nrelightable [18] free-viewpoint videos of moving people.\nMost of these background.\nMLP initialization : We initialize the weights of the\nlast layer of the non-rigid motion MLP and pose correction\nMLP to small values, U(\u221210\u22125,10\u22125), i.e., initializing the\noffset to be close to zero and the pose refinement rotation\nmatrices each near the identity.\nImportance ray sampling : We sample more rays for the\nforeground subject, indicated by the segmentation masks.\nSpecifically, we enforce random ray sampling with proba-\nbility 0.8 for foreground subject pixels and 0.2 for the back-\nground region.Subject 313 Subject 315 Subject 390\nPSNR \u2191SSIM\u2191LPIPS* \u2193 PSNR \u2191SSIM\u2191LPIPS* \u2193 PSNR \u2191SSIM\u2191LPIPS* \u2193\nNeural Body [50] 29.417 0.9635 57.24 26.93 0.9597 55.97 29.57 0.9609 52.12\nOurs 29.421 0.9672 29.54 26.65 0.9636 33.76 30.52 0.9682 33.88\nTable 4.

As shown in Fig. 14,", " Introduction\nImage synthesis is one of the computer vision \ufb01elds with\nthe most spectacular recent development, but also among\nthose with the greatest computational demands. Espe-\ncially high-resolution synthesis of complex, natural scenes\nis presently dominated by scaling up likelihood-based mod-\nels, potentially containing billions of parameters in autore-\ngressive (AR) transformers [66,67]. In contrast, the promis-\ning Related Work\nGenerative Models for Image Synthesis The high di-\nmensional nature of images presents distinct challenges\nto generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) [27] allow for ef\ufb01cient sampling of high resolution\nimages with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are dif\ufb01-\n2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full\ndata distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth-\nods emphasize good density estimation which renders op-\ntimization more well-behaved. Variational autoencoders\n(V AE) [46] and \ufb02ow-based models [18, 19] enable ef\ufb01cient\nsynthesis of high resolution images [9, 44, 92], but sam-\nple quality is not on par with GANs. While autoregressive\nmodels (ARM) [6, 10, 94, 95] achieve strong performance\nin density estimation, computationally demanding architec-\ntures [97] and a sequential sampling process limit them to\nlow resolution images. Because pixel based representations\nof images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency de-\ntails [16,73], maximum-likelihood training spends a dispro-\nportionate amount of capacity on modeling them, resulting\nin long training times. To scale to higher resolutions, several\ntwo-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model\na compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels.\nRecently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82],\nhave achieved state-of-the-art methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(zjx) =\nN(z;E\u0016;E\u001b2)and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0;1)as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu-\nlarizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of jZjdifferent exemplars [96].\nTo obtain high-\ufb01delity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the\nKLterm by a factor\u001810\u00006or choose a high codebook dimensionality jZj.\nThe full objective to train the autoencoding model (E;D)reads:\nLAutoencoder = min\nE;Dmax\n \u0010\nLrec(x;D(E(x)))\u0000Ladv(D(E(x))) + logD (x) +Lreg(x;E;D)\u0011\n(25)\nDM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two\ncases when learning p(z)orp(zjy)(Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we sample z=E\u0016(x)+E\u001b(x)\u0001\"=:E(x),\nwhere\"\u0018N(0;1). When rescaling the latent, we estimate the component-wise variance\n^\u001b2=1\nbchwX\nb;c;h;w(zb;c;h;w\u0000^\u0016)2\nfrom the \ufb01rst batch in the data, where ^\u0016=1\nbchwP\nb;c;h;wzb;c;h;w. The output ofEis scaled such that the rescaled latent has\nunit standard deviation, i.e.z z\n^\u001b=E(x)\n^\u001b. (ii) For a VQ-regularized latent space, we extract zbefore the quantization layer\nand absorb the quantization operation into the decoder, i.e. it can be interpreted as the \ufb01rst layer of D.\nH. Additional Qualitative Experiments\nLDMs provide means to \ufb02exible and computationally\ntractable diffusion based image synthesis of various image\nmodalities, which we empirically show in the following.\nFirstly, however, we analyze the gains of our models com-\npared to pixel-based diffusion models in both training and\ninference. Interestingly, we \ufb01nd that LDMs trained in VQ-\nregularized latent spaces sometimes achieve better sample\nquality, even though the reconstruction capabilities of VQ-\nregularized \ufb01rst stage models slightly fall behind those of\ntheir continuous counterparts, cf.

Therefore,\na tool capable of generating realistic images from natural\nlanguage can empower humans to create rich and diverse\nvisual content with unprecedented ease. The ability to edit\nimages using natural language further allows for iterative re-\n\ufb01nement and \ufb01ne-grained control, both of which are critical\nfor real world applications.\nRecent text-conditional image models are capable of syn-\nthesizing images from free-form text prompts, and can com-\npose unrelated objects in semantically plausible ways (Xu\net al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2020; Ramesh et al.,\n2021; Zhang et al., 2021). However, they are not yet able\nto generate photorealistic images that capture all aspects of\n\u0003Equal contribution. Correspondence to alex@openai.com,\nprafulla@openai.com, aramesh@openai.comtheir corresponding text prompts.\nOn the other hand, unconditional image models can syn-\nthesize photorealistic images (Brock et al., 2018; Karras\net al., 2019a;b; Razavi et al., 2019), sometimes with enough\n\ufb01delity that humans can\u2019t distinguish them from real images\n(Zhou et al., 2019). Within this line of research, diffusion\nmodels (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2020b)\nhave emerged as a promising family of generative models,\nachieving state-of-the-art sample quality on a number of\nimage generation benchmarks (Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal &\nNichol, 2021; Ho et al., 2021).\nTo achieve photorealism in the class-conditional setting,\nDhariwal & Nichol (2021) augmented diffusion models\nwith classi\ufb01er guidance , a technique which allows diffusion\nmodels to condition on a classi\ufb01er\u2019s labels. The classi\ufb01er\nis \ufb01rst trained on noised images, and during the diffusion\nsampling process, gradients from the classi\ufb01er are used\nto guide the sample towards the label. Ho & Salimans\n(2021) achieved similar results, we follow Avrahami et al. (2021)\nand use CLIP to select the best of 64 samples. Our \ufb01ne-tuned samples have more realistic lighting, shadows and textures, but sometimes\ndon\u2019t focus on the prompt (eg. golden necklace), whereas implicit samples capture the prompt better.\nand then take three crops at the endpoints and middle along\nthe longer side. We feed all three crops into a pre-trained\nCLIP ViT-B/16, and mean-pool the resulting feature vec-\ntors. Finally, we \ufb01t an SVM with an RBF kernel to the\nresulting feature vectors, and tune the bias to result in less\nthan a 1% false negative rate. We tested this model on a\nseparate batch of 1024 samples, and found that it produced\nno false negatives (i.e. we manually visually inspected the\nimages the model classi\ufb01ed as not containing people, and\nwe ourselves found no images of people).\nWhile developing the people \ufb01lter, we were aiming to de-\ntect all people in all types of environments reliably, a task\nwhich is often dif\ufb01cult for modern face detection systems\nespecially when dealing with people of all demographics\n(Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Santurkar et al., 2019).

In Computer Vision", " Introduction\nDetailed 3D object models bring multimedia experiences\nto life. Games, virtual reality applications and \ufb01lms are each\npopulated with thousands of object models, each designed\nand textured by hand with digital software. While expert\nartists can author high-\ufb01delity assets, the process is painstak-\ningly slow and expensive. Prior work leverages 3D datasets\nto synthesize shapes in the form of point clouds, voxel grids,\ntriangle meshes, and implicit functions using generative mod-\nels like GANs [4, 21, 57, 65]. These approaches only sup-\nport a few object categories due to small labeled 3D shape\ndatasets. But multimedia applications require a wide variety\nof content, and need both 3D geometry and texture.\nIn this work, we propose Dream Fields, a method to\nautomatically generate open-set 3D models from natural\nlanguage prompts. Unlike prior work, our method does\nnot require any 3D training data, and uses natural language\nprompts that are easy to author with an expressive interface\nfor specifying desired object properties. We demonstrate that\nthe compositionality of language allows for \ufb02exible creative\ncontrol over shapes, colors and styles.\nA Dream Field is a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) trained\nto maximize a deep perceptual metric with respect to both\n1arXiv:2112.01455v2  [cs.CV]  4 May 2022the geometry and color of a scene. NeRF and other neural 3D\nrepresentations have recently been successfully applied to\nnovel view synthesis tasks where ground-truth RGB photos\nare available. NeRF is trained to reconstruct images from\nmultiple viewpoints. As the learned radiance \ufb01eld is shared\nacross viewpoints, NeRF can interpolate between viewpoints\nsmoothly and consistently. Due to its neural representation,\nNeRF can be sampled at high spatial resolutions unlike voxel\nrepresentations and point clouds, and are easy to optimize\nunlike explicit geometric representations like meshes as it is\ntopology-free.\nHowever, existing photographs are not available when\ncreating novel objects from descriptions alone. Instead of\nlearning to reconstruct known input photos, we learn a radi-\nance \ufb01eld such that its renderings have high semantic similar-\nity with a given text prompt. We extract these semantics with\npre-trained neural image-text retrieval models like CLIP [46],\nlearned from hundreds of millions of captioned images. As\nNeRF\u2019s volumetric rendering and CLIP\u2019s image-text repre-\nsentations are differentiable, we can optimize Dream Fields\nend-to-end for each prompt. Figure 1 illustrates our method.\nIn results for this ablation optimize CLIP ViT\nB/16.\nThe 2D image is an RGB \u000bpixel grid, composited\nwith random backgrounds during optimization similar to\nDream Fields. Optimizing a single 2D RGB \u000bimage does\nnot produce a multi-view consistent 3D object, so other\nviewpoints cannot be rendered. Even with transmittance\nand TV regularization, the resulting image is noisy.\nThe voxel grid stores 1283RGB and alpha values, in-\nterpolated trilinearly at ray sample points and composited\nwithout a neural network using the PyTorch3D library.

This issue partially mo-\ntivated the construction of our own dataset, in which great care is\ntaken to prevent such photometric variation.\n14SVS\n Our Model w/GLO\nM60 Playground Train Truck\nFigure 12. A visualization of our model with Stable View Synthesis [41] on scenes from the Tanks and Temples dataset [25]. Image\nquality is roughly comparable across the two techniques, though our renderings exhibits different failure modes than SVS\u2019s in the absence\nof observations (as in M60) and, because our model neutralizes most photometric variation during training, our renderings may have a\ndifferent global brightness or color shift (as in Train ).\nror metrics: before evaluating each metric we solve a per-\nimage least squares problem that \ufb01ts a quadratic polynomial\nexpansion of the rendering\u2019s RGB values to the true image,\nwhile ignoring saturated pixels. This partially reduces the\neffect of photometric variation on this data, and yields re-\nsults in which SVS and our model (with GLO) are roughly\nquantitatively comparable.\nWhen using these color-corrected metrics, our model\nslightly outperforms SVS in terms of PSNR, but under-\nperforms SVS on SSIM and LPIPS. With this in mind, it\nis worth reiterating the advantages that SVS has over our\nmodel on this benchmark: 1) SVS has been trained on the\ntraining set of this dataset, while our model does not use\nthat external training data \u2014 and indeed uses no external\ntraining data at all. 2) SVS relies on a proxy geometry pro-\nduced by an external system (and may fail when that ge-\nometry is incorrect), while we use no proxy geometry and\nin fact produce high-quality depth maps ourselves. 3) SVS\nhas been trained with a perceptual loss, while our model is\ntrained using only a per-pixel loss on RGB. 4) Our model\nis extremely compact, and requires only 10 million parame-\nters to perform view synthesis, while SVS requires multiple\nlarge CNNs and access to all training images (because it op-\nerates by blending training images together) to render novel\nviews.\nFrom Table 7 we see that our model\u2019s improvement over\nSVS is most signi\ufb01cant on the playground scene. Notably,\nthis is the only test-set scene that mostly consists of natural\ncontent, while the other three scenes predominately feature\nlarge vehicles. We speculate that SVS may be better-suited\nto large piecewise planar objects (which makes sense, given\nSVS\u2019s reliance on a proxy geometry that is itself a piecewise\nplanar mesh) while ours may be better suited to scenes that\ncontain natural content (trees, grass, \ufb02owers, etc).E. Potential Negative Impact\nThe broad use of neural rendering techniques carries\nwith it several potential negative societal impacts. NeRF-\nlike models have recently been incorporated into generative\nmodeling approaches [15], and generative modeling tech-\nniques can be used to synthesize \u201cdeep fakes\u201d that could\nbe used to mislead people. Though our work does not di-\nrectly concern generative modeling and instead aims to re-\nconstruct accurate physical models of a scene from which\nnew views can be generated, our contributions may be use-\nful for generative approaches that build on NeRF.\nThe ability to reconstruct accurate models of a scene\nfrom photographs may have modest potential negative im-\npacts. Our technique could conceivably be used to construct\na surveillance system, and such a system could have nega-\ntive impact if", " Introduction\nFields such as simulation, architecture, gaming, and \ufb01lm rely on high-quality 3D content with rich\ngeometric details and complex topology. However, creating such content requires tremendous expert\nhuman effort. It takes a signi\ufb01cant amount of development time to create each individual 3D asset. In\ncontrast, creating rough 3D shapes with simple building blocks like voxels has been widely adopted.\nFor example, Minecraft has been used by hundreds of millions of users for creating 3D content. Most\nof them are non-experts. Developing A.I. tools that enable regular people to upscale coarse, voxelized\nobjects into high resolution, beautiful 3D shapes would bring us one step closer to democratizing\nhigh-quality 3D content creation. Similar tools can be envisioned for turning 3D scans of objects\nrecorded by modern phones into high-quality forms. Our work aspires to create such capabilities.\nA powerful 3D representation is a critical component of a learning-based 3D content creation\nframework. A good 3D representation for high-quality reconstruction and synthesis should capture\nlocal geometric details and represent objects with arbitrary topology while also being memory and\ncomputationally ef\ufb01cient for fast inference in interactive applications.\nRecently, neural implicit representations [ 8,39,42,51], which use a neural network to implicitly\nrepresent a shape via a signed distance \ufb01eld (SDF) or an occupancy \ufb01eld (OF), have emerged as\nan effective 3D representation. Neural implicits have the bene\ufb01t of representing complex geometry\n35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).arXiv:2111.04276v1  [cs.CV]  8 Nov 2021and topology, not limited to a prede\ufb01ned resolution. The success of these methods, con\ufb01rmed by quantitative metrics and an extensive\nuser study. By showcasing the ability to upscale coarse voxels such as Minecraft shapes, we hope\nthat we take one step closer to democratizing 3D content creation.\n6 Broad Impact\nMany \ufb01elds such as AR/VR, robotics, architecture, gaming and \ufb01lm rely on high-quality 3D content.\nCreating such content, however, requires human experts, i.e., experienced artists, and a signi\ufb01cant\namount of development time. In contrast, platforms like Minecraft enable millions of users around the\nworld to carve out coarse shapes with simple blocks. Our work aims at creating A.I. tools that would\nenable even novice users to upscale simple, low-resolution shapes into high resolution, beautiful 3D\ncontent. Our method currently focuses on 3D animal shapes. We are not currently aware of and do\nnot foresee nefarious use cases of our method.\n7 Disclosure of Funding\nThis work was funded by NVIDIA.

In the last\ndecades models of varying degrees of realism have been\nsuccessfully deployed e.g. for 3D human motion analysis\n[48], 3D human pose and shape reconstruction [25, 54], per-\nsonal avatar creation [3, 56], medical diagnosis and treat-\nment [17], or image synthesis and video editing [55, 22].\nModern statistical body models are typically learnt from\nlarge collections of 3D scans of real people, which are used\nto capture the body shape variations among the human pop-\nulation. Dynamic scans, when available, can be used to fur-\nther model how different poses affect the deformation of the\nmuscles and the soft-tissue of the human body.\nThe recently released GHUM model [51] follows this\nmethodology by describing the human body, its shape vari-\nation, articulated pose including fingers, and facial ex-\npressions as a moderate resolution mesh based on a low-\ndimensional, partly interpretable parameterization. In the\n*The first two authors contributed equally.\nFigure 1. imGHUM is the first parametric full human body model\nrepresented as an implicit signed distance function. imGHUM\nsuccessfully models broad variations in pose, shape, and facial ex-\npressions. The level sets of imGHUM are shown in blue-scale.\ndeep learning literature GHUM and similar models [29, 24]\nare typically used as fixed function layers. This means that\nthe model is parameterized with the output of a neural net-\nwork or some other non-linear function, and the resulting\nmesh is used to compute the final function value. While\nthis approach works well for several tasks, including, more\nrecently, 3D reconstruction, the question of how to best rep-\nresent complex 3D deformable and articulated structures is\nopen. Recent work dealing with the 3D visual reconstruc-\ntion of general objects aimed to represent the output not as\nmeshes but as implicit functions [30, 34, 7, 31]. Such ap-\nproaches thus describe surfaces by the zero-level-set (deci-\nsion boundary) of a function over points in 3D-space. This\nhas clear benefits as the output is neither constrained by a\ntemplate mesh topology, nor is it discretized and thus of\nfixed spatial resolution.\nIn this work, we investigate the possibility to learn a\ndata-driven statistical body model as an implicit function.\nGiven the maturity of state of the art explicit human models,\nit is crucial that an equivalent implicit representation main-\ntains their key, attractive properties \u2013 representing compa-\nrable variation in shape and pose and similar level of detail.\nThis is challenging since recently-proposed implicit func-\ntion networks tend to produce overly smooth shapes and\nfail for articulated humans [8]. We propose a novel net-\nwork architecture and a learning paradigm that enable, for\nthe first time, constructing detailed generative models of hu-\nman pose, shape, and semantics, represented as Signed Dis-\ntance Functions (SDFs) (see fig. 1).

Recent works represent surfaces as\nsigned distance functions (SDF) [ 49,52,17,23] or occupancy [ 30,31]. To train their neural models,\nthese results on the DTU dataset.\n23 introduction, it can handle sudden depth changes\nand synthesize high-quality images. However, extracting high-\ufb01delity surface from the learned\nimplicit \ufb01eld is dif\ufb01cult because the density-based scene representation lacks suf\ufb01cient constraints\non its level sets. In contrast, our method combines the advantages of surface rendering based and\nvolume rendering based background\nby NeRF++ [ 53]. Our network architecture\nand initialization scheme are similar to those\nof IDR [ 49]. More details of the network archi-\ntecture and training parameters can be found in\nthe supplementary material.\n4.2 Comparisons\nWe conducted the comparisons in two settings,\nwith mask supervision (w/ mask) and without mask supervision (w/o mask). We measure the\nreconstruction quality with the Chamfer distances in the same way as UNISURF [31] and IDR [49]\nand report the scores in Table 1. The Conclusion\nWe have proposed NeuS , a new approach to multiview surface reconstruction that represents 3D\nsurfaces as neural SDF and developed a new volume rendering method for training the implicit SDF\nrepresentation. NeuS produces high-quality reconstruction and successfully reconstructs objects with\nsevere occlusions and complex structures. It outperforms the state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. One limitation of our method is that although our method does not heavily rely on\ncorrespondence matching of texture features, the performance would still degrade for textureless\nobjects (we show the failure cases in the supplementary material). Moreover, NeuS has only a single\nscale parameter sthat is used to model the standard deviation of the probability distribution for all\nthe spatial location. Hence, an interesting future research topic is to model the probability with\ndifferent variances for different spatial locations together with the optimization of scene representation,\ndepending on different local geometric characteristics. Negative societal impact: like many other\nlearning-based works, our method requires a large amount of computational resources for network\ntraining, which can be a concern for global climate change.\n10Acknowlegements\nWe thank Michael Oechsle for providing the References\n[1]Matan Atzmon and Yaron Lipman.

These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text\nprompts [ 72,50] or learning useful feature representations [ 14,7]. While these models are already\n\u0003Equal contributionarXiv:2105.05233v4  [cs.LG]  1 Jun 2021capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond\nthe current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic\ndesign, games, music production, and countless other \ufb01elds.\nGANs [ 19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [ 5,68,28] as measured\nby sample quality metrics such as FID [ 23], Inception Score [ 54] and Precision [ 32]. However, some\nof these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity\nthan state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [ 51,43,42]. Furthermore, GANs are often dif\ufb01cult to\ntrain, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4].\nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them dif\ufb01cult to scale and apply to\nnew domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with\nlikelihood-based models [ 51,25,42,9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically\neasier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore,\nexcept for V AEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time.\nDiffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models which have recently been shown to produce\nhigh-quality images [ 56,59,25] while offering desirable properties such as distribution coverage,\na stationary training objective, and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually\nremoving noise from a signal, and their training objective can be expressed as a reweighted variational\nlower-bound [ 25]. This class of models already holds the state-of-the-art [ 60] on CIFAR-10 [ 31], but\nstill lags behind GANs on dif\ufb01cult generation datasets like LSUN and ImageNet. Nichol and Dhariwal\n[43] found that these models improve reliably with increased compute, and can produce high-quality\nsamples even on the dif\ufb01cult ImageNet 256 \u0002256 dataset using an upsampling stack. However, the\nFID of this model is still not competitive with BigGAN-deep [5], the current state-of-the-art on this\ndataset.\nWe hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors:\n\ufb01rst, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and\nre\ufb01ned; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for \ufb01delity, producing high quality samples\nbut not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these bene\ufb01ts to diffusion models, \ufb01rst by\nimproving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for \ufb01delity.\nWith these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different\nmetrics and datasets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion\nmodels based on Ho et al. [ 25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [ 43] and Song\net al.

(2015) introduced diffusion probabilis-\ntic models, a class of generative models which match a\ndata distribution by learning to reverse a gradual, multi-step\nnoising process. More recently, Ho et al. (2020) showed\nan equivalence between denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels (DDPM) and score based generative models (Song\n& Ermon, 2019; 2020), which learn a gradient of the log-\ndensity of the data distribution using denoising score match-\ning (Hyv \u00a8arinen, 2005). It has recently been shown that this\nclass of models can produce high-quality images (Ho et al.,\n2020; Song & Ermon, 2020; Jolicoeur-Martineau et al.,\n2020) and audio (Chen et al., 2020b; Kong et al., 2020),\nbut it has yet to be shown that DDPMs can achieve log-\nlikelihoods competitive with other likelihood-based models\nsuch as autoregressive models (van den Oord et al., 2016c)\nand V AEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013). This raises various\nquestions, such as whether DDPMs are capable of capturing\nall the modes of a distribution. Furthermore, while Ho et al.\n*Equal contribution1OpenAI, San Francisco, USA.

It has been shown, for instance, that V+L pre-\ntraining leads to transferrable joint representations that ben-\ne\ufb01t multiple downstream V+L tasks, including visual ques-\ntion answering, image and text retrieval, and referring ex-\npression comprehension [55, 49, 21, 77, 3, 74, 88, 48, 56].\nWhat makes V+L pre-training successful? On one hand,\nthis is due to advances in architectures and modeling that are\nmainly inspired by BERT and similar models in natural lan-\nguage understanding and generation [25, 53, 82, 46, 26, 66].\nIn particular, the idea of using \ufb02exible self-attention mech-\n1Our dataset is available at https : / / github . com /\ngoogle-research-datasets/conceptual-12m .\n<PERSON> was the first US president to \nattend a tournament in sumo's hallowed \nRyogoku Kokugikan arena.

On the other hand, the avail-\nability of large-scale labeled and weakly-labeled data in the\nV+L domain [61, 20, 43, 70] is truly what enables such\nmodels to learn associations between the two modalities.\nIneither vision orlanguage community, one notable\ntrend is that scaling up training data is useful. In contrast,\ndatasets in V+L research remain relatively limited in terms\nof scale and diversity. The capability of JFT-300M [76]\nand Instagram [58] over orders-of-magnitude smaller Im-\nageNet [69] has been put to test on multiple downstream\nimage classi\ufb01cation and object detection tasks. In NLP, the\nsize of pre-training data sources for training deep language\nmodels rose from the 20GB BooksCorpus [90]+English\nWikipedia in BERT[25], to the 570GB dataset in GPT-\n3 [12] and the 745GB C4 dataset in T5 [66].\n1arXiv:2102.08981v2  [cs.CV]  30 Mar 2021In contrast, V+L datasets are limited in two ways.\nFirst, the effective sizes of popular V+L datasets are low.\nThe number of images in these datasets range from fewer\nthan a few hundred thousands [84, 20, 44, 28] to sev-\neral millions [70], with lower text quality as the scale in-\ncreases. Second, many of the small-sized datasets share the\nsame, limited visual domain; COCO-Captions [20], Visual\nGenome [44], and VQA2 [27] are (mostly) based on sev-\neral hundreds thousand of COCO images [52]. The lack\nin scale and diversity of visual concepts (with respect to\nvision/language-only counterparts) makes it hard for V+L\nmodels to perform adequately in the wild.\nOne major reason for these gaps is the dif\ufb01culty in\ncollecting such datasets. Unlike in image classi\ufb01cation,\n\u201ctext\u201d in V+L datasets is longer and less likely to be\nagreed upon, making the annotation process more costly\nand time-consuming. One approach to remedy this is to\nmake use of large amounts of the alt-texts accompanying\nimages on the Web. For instance, Sharma et al. intro-\nduced Conceptual", "ABSTRACT\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved high qual-\nity image generation without adversarial training, yet they require simulating a\nMarkov chain for many steps in order to produce a sample. To accelerate sam-\npling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more ef\ufb01cient\nclass of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as\nDDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is de\ufb01ned as the reverse of a particular\nMarkovian diffusion process. We generalize DDPMs via a class of non-Markovian\ndiffusion processes that lead to the same training objective. These non-Markovian\nprocesses can correspond to generative processes that are deterministic, giving rise\nto implicit models that produce high quality samples much faster. We empirically\ndemonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples 10\u0002to50\u0002faster in\nterms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation\nfor sample quality, perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly\nin the latent space, and reconstruct observations with very low error.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nDeep generative models have demonstrated the ability to produce high quality samples in many\ndomains (Karras et al., 2020; van den Oord et al., 2016a).

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details).

Conventional mocap methods were tested on CPU\nusing an early 2015 edition MacBook Pro with Intel Core\ni7, running at 3.1GHz and 16GB RAM. Runtimes for each\nstep depend heavily on the frame rate and pose variation\nof the motion. For sequences in the SSM dataset, average\nruntimes of MoSh++ are as follows:\n\u000fStage I: about 25min/motion sequence\n\u000fStage II without dynamics: about 0:5sec/frame\n\u000fStage II with dynamics: about 2sec/frameFigure 9: Optimal number of shape and dynamics compo-\nnents.

Data Collection\nSection.4.1 of the main paper presents the SSM (Syn-\nchronized Scans and Markers) dataset. To record thisdataset we use an optical motion capture system synchro-\nnized and calibrated together with a high resolution 4D\nscanning system.\nWe used an OptiTrack motion capture system (Natural-\nPoint, Inc. DBA OptiTrack. Corvallis, OR) [33] consisting\nof 24 Optitrack Prime 17W optical mocap cameras. Each\nsubject was \ufb01tted with 67 re\ufb02ective mocap markers based\non the optimized marker-set layout proposed in [27]. The\nsubjects wore minimal clothing to avoid artefacts due to\nsliding of cloth. The markers were placed directly on the\nskin of the subjects wherever possible.\nThe motion capture system was synchronized to be trig-\ngered with a 3dMD 4D body scanning system (3dMD LLC,\nAtlanta, GA) [1]. The 4D scanner is capable of captur-\ning high-resolution 3D scans of a person at 60 frames per\nsecond. The 4D system uses 22 pairs of stereo cameras,\n22 color cameras and 34 speckle projectors and arrays of\nwhite-light LED panels.\n4. Model Size\nSection 3.1 of the main paper describes the SMPL body\nmodel incorporated in the MoSh++ pipeline. We experi-\nmented with varying numbers of SMPL shape components\nand DMPL dynamic components to \ufb01nd the optimal num-\nber to use to capture shape and soft-tissue motion. We found\nthatj\fj= 16 , andj\u001ej= 8 do the best job of minimizing\nerror on the held-out validation set and also produce natural\nlooking soft-tissue deformations. Given a limited number\nof mocap markers, allowing more shape variation results in\nover\ufb01tting (see Fig. 9).\n5. Diversity and Quality\nWe provide a video to illustrate the variations in the mo-\ntions in AMASS and the quality of reconstructed body sur-\nface deformations from the mocap markers. Please see the\nvideo. Note that AMASS captures a wide range of body\nshapes and motions. Related Work\nThere is a large literature on estimating skeletal param-\neters from mocap markers as well as several commercial\nsolutions that solve this problem. As shown by Gorton et\nal.

Addressing this task has ap-\nplications in problems that require going beyond plain land-\nmark localization, such as graphics, augmented reality, or\nhuman-computer interaction, and could also be a stepping\nstone towards general 3D-based object understanding.\nThe task of establishing dense correspondences from an\nimage to a surface-based model has been addressed mostly\nin the setting where a depth sensor is available, as in the Vit-\nruvian manifold of [41], metric regression forests [33], or\nthe more recent dense point cloud correspondence of [44].\nBy contrast, in our case we consider a single RGB image\nas input, based on which we establish a correspondence be-\ntween surface points and image pixels.\nSeveral other works have recently aimed at recovering\ndense correspondences between pairs [3] or sets of RGB im-\nages [48, 10] in an unsupervised setting. More recently, [42]\nused the equivariance principle in order to align sets of im-\nages to a common coordinate system, while following the\ngeneral idea of groupwise image alignment, e.g. [23, 21].\nWhile these works are aiming at general categories, our\nwork is focused on arguably the most important visual cat-\negory, humans.

This research could lead to significant improvements in the fidelity and usability of reconstructed scenes, fostering innovation in content creation and enhancing user experiences. Furthermore, it could pave the way for new methodologies in 3D reconstruction and editing, influencing future research directions and applications in various industries.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in this problem stem from the need to ensure that newly inserted objects maintain 3D consistency from multiple viewpoints, which is complex due to the varying perspectives and occlusions present in 3D scenes. Additionally, producing high-quality objects with realistic geometry and texture is technically demanding, as it requires sophisticated modeling and rendering techniques. Naive approaches may fail because they often overlook the intricate relationships between the inserted objects and the existing scene, leading to visual inconsistencies and artifacts. Overcoming these technical and practical obstacles requires advanced algorithms and a deep understanding of 3D representation.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has often focused on either 3D reconstruction or object insertion separately, lacking integrated approaches that address both aspects simultaneously. Limitations in existing solutions include inadequate handling of 3D consistency and the quality of generated objects, as well as the inability to harmonize new objects with complex backgrounds. Barriers such as the complexity of 3D data and the computational demands of high-quality rendering have also hindered progress. Our approach differs by leveraging diffusion models and Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize 3D representations in a way that aligns with high-probability density regions, thus addressing these gaps more effectively.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves using a multi-view inpainting model trained on the Wild-RGBD dataset, which consists of approximately 1,600 diverse scenes.

By enhancing personalization and efficiency in editing processes, this framework could revolutionize various applications ranging from video gaming to virtual reality and film-making. The ability to manipulate 3D scenes using natural language will not only democratize access to 3D content creation for non-experts but will also inspire future research in human-computer interaction and generative design. Advancing knowledge in this area could lead to practical applications, such as improved tools for educators, designers, and artists, ultimately fostering creativity and innovation in digital environments.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges in solving this problem are multifaceted. First, integrating generative models with reinforcement learning involves complex algorithmic design and requires a deep understanding of both fields. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent difficulty in accurately interpreting natural language instructions and translating them into meaningful 3D modifications. Additionally, achieving real-time adaptation based on user interactions necessitates robust data collection, analysis, and model training processes. The technical obstacles include ensuring high fidelity and quality in 3D content generation while maintaining computational efficiency. The theoretical complexities arise from the need to model user preferences accurately and adapt the generative process dynamically, which can be influenced by a myriad of contextual factors.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research in 3D content generation has largely focused on translating static inputs (like text or images) into 3D objects without a significant emphasis on interactive, user-driven manipulation. Existing solutions often lack the integration of multi-modal feedback mechanisms that could enhance user experience. Barriers such as data scarcity for training robust models and the computational limitations of real-time processing have impeded progress in this area. Our approach differs by explicitly incorporating reinforcement learning to create a feedback loop that learns from user interactions, thereby continuously improving the system's responsiveness and relevance. This is in contrast to prior methods that primarily rely on one-way input-output relationships, thus limiting their adaptability.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid framework that integrates generative models with reinforcement learning to facilitate interactive 3D content generation. We will utilize a dataset comprising diverse 3D scenes and user-generated content to train our models. The key components include a natural language processing module to interpret user instructions, a generative model (such as a pre-trained diffusion model) for content creation, and a reinforcement learning component that adapts the system based on user feedback. We will evaluate the framework using metrics such as user satisfaction, the relevance of generated content, and the efficiency of the editing process. Expected outcomes include a more intuitive interface for users, higher quality 3D content generation that aligns with user intent, and a significant advancement in the personalization of virtual editing environments.", "referenced_intros": [" INTRODUCTION\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques\nsuch as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al .2020], it\nis nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene\nfrom captured real-world data without intensive labor.

RELATED WORK\n2.1 Implicit 3D Representation\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper [Mildenhall et al .2020],\nbecame one of the most popular implicit 3D representation tech-\nniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel\nviews with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation\nwith a compact model compared to explicit representations such\nas polygon mesh or voxels. In our research, we use the \"nerfacto\"\nmodel implemented by Nerfstudio [Tancik et al .2023], which is a\ncombination of modular features from multiple papers [Barron et al .\n2022; Martin-Brualla et al .2021; M\u00fcller et al .2022; Verbin et al .2022;\nWang et al .2021] , designed to achieve a balance between speed and\nquality.\n2.2 Diffusion Models\nDiffusion models [Dhariwal and Nichol 2021; Sohl-Dickstein et al .\n2015; Song et al .2020b] are generative models that have gainedsignificant attention for their ability to generate high-quality, diverse\nimages. Inspired by classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics, they\nare trained to generate an image by reversing the diffusion process,\nprogressively denoising noisy images towards meaningful ones.\nDiffusion models are commonly trained with classifier-free guidance\n[Ho and Salimans 2022] to enable image generation conditioned on\nan input text.\n2.2.1 Controlled Generations with Diffusion Models. Leveraging the\nsuccess of T2I diffusion models, recent research has expanded their\napplication to controlled image generation and editing, notably in\nimage-to-image (I2I) tasks [Brooks et al .2023; Hertz et al .2023a,\n2022; Kawar et al .2023; Meng et al .2021; Mokady et al .2023; Parmar\net al .2023; Tumanyan et al .2023]. For example, SDEdit [Meng\net al.2021] achieves this by first adding noise to a source image\nand then guiding the diffusion process toward an output based\non a given prompt. ControlNet [Zhang et al .2023] was proposed\nas an add-on architecture for training T2I diffusion models with\nextra conditioning inputs such as depth, pose, edge maps, and more.\nSeveral recent techniques [Cheng et al .2023; Hertz et al .2023b; Sohn\net al.2024] focus on generating style-aligned images. In our work,\nwe use a depth-conditioned I2I pipeline with an attention-sharing\nmechanism similar to \"StyleAligned\" [Hertz et al .2023b] to create a\nset of multi-view images sharing a consistent style.\n2.3 Style Transfer\n2.3.1 2D Style Transfer. Style transfer originally refers to a tech-\nnique for blending images, a source image and a style image, to\ncreate another image that retains the first\u2019s content but exhibits the\nsecond\u2019s style. Since the introduction of the foundational style trans-\nfer algorithm proposed by [Gatys et al .2015], many follow-up works\nfor 2D style transfer have been explored for further improvements\nsuch as faster optimization [Huang and Belongie 2017; Johnson et al .\n2016], zero-shot style-transfer [Li et al .2017], and photo-realism\n[Luan et al. 2017].

The majority of these approaches heav-\nily rely on explicit RGB and depth inpainting priors, of-\nten employing 2D inpainters like LaMa [27] to indepen-\ndently inpaint all views and subsequently address the multi-\nview inconsistency. For example, SPIn-NeRF [17] and\nInpaintNeRF360 [30] incorporate a perceptual loss within\nmasked regions to account for low-level inconsistency, but\nthe perceptual-level inconsistency still cannot be fully ad-\ndressed (see from Fig. 1 (b)(e)). Another approach involves\npreventing inconsistent and incorrect views from being used\nin NeRF optimization. To achieve this, Weder et al. [35] in-\ntroduce uncertainty variables to model the confidence of 2D\ninpainting experiments to show the effectiveness of\nour method over existing NeRF inpainting techniques.\n2. Related Work\n2.1.

De-\nspite this, only a limited number of studies have delved\ninto the task of object removal or inpainting from pre-\ntrained NeRF models.

The Directional Score is designed to assess how well changes in textual\ndescriptions correlate with corresponding changes in images.

However, this representa-\ntion couples the appearance and geometry of the scene within the unordered\nand irregular 3D Gaussians, which hinders the flexibility of appearance editing\nfor 3D-GS compared to meshes, where appearance can be easily parameterized\ninto texture maps. Although considerable efforts have been made to edit 3D\nGaussian-based scenes [3,7,14,24,28], the manipulation of appearance remains\ninconvenientsincetheseworksstillfollowtheentangledrepresentationof3D-GS.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method, named Texture-GS, which aims\nto explicitly disentangle the geometry and texture for 3D-GS, thereby signifi-\ncantly improving the flexibility of appearance editing for 3D scenes. Texture-GS\nfollows 3D-GS in modeling the geometry as a set of anisotropic 3D Gaussians,\nbut crucially, it represents the view independent appearance as a 2D texture\nmap. Leveraging this disentangled representation, Texture-GS retains the pow-\nerful capabilities of 3D-GS for faithful reconstruction and real-time rendering,\nwhile also facilitating various appearance editing applications, such as texture\nswapping shown in Fig. 1.\nThe key challenge in implementing our Texture-GS lies in establishing a con-\nnectionbetweenthegeometry(3DGaussians)andappearance(2Dtexturemap).\nNeuTex [23] has proposed a texture mapping MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)\nthat regresses 2D UV coordinates for every 3D point to represent the radiance\nof NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) [16] in a 2D texture space. However, evaluating\nan MLP for each ray-Gaussian intersection is unsuitable for our Texture-GS, as\nit would be prohibitively expensive for real-time rendering, which is a key advan-\ntage of 3D-GS over NeRF-based methods, maintaining the render-\ning quality that is on par and sometimes superior on the same hardware. The\naverage training time of NeuTex [23] is 30 hours per scene, while ours amounts\nto 90 minutes.\nTexture-GS allows pixels covered by a single Gaussian to possess different\ncolors, thereby enhancing the representational power for each Gaussian. To fur-\nther accelerate the rendering speed, we simplify the geometry by pruning 50%,\n80% and 95% 3D Gaussians according to their opacity values. As illustrated\nin Tab. 1b, reducing the number of Gaussians inevitably leads to a minor per-\nformance decline, while greatly reducing the computational costs.

From immersive games and movies to cutting-edge\nvirtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) applications,\nthere is an increasing need for efficient tools for creating\nand editing 3D content. While there has been significant\nprogress in 3D reconstruction and generation, 3D editing\nremain a less-studied area. In this work, we focus on 3D\nscene manipulation by replacing current objects in the scene\nwith new contents with only natural language prompts from\na user. Imagine putting on a VR headset and trying to re-\nmodel one\u2019s living room. One can swap out the current sofa\nwith a sleek new design, add some lush greenery, or remove\nclutter to create a more spacious feel.\nIn this project, we introduce the ReplaceAnything3D\nmodel (RAM3D), a text-guided Erase-and-Replace method\nfor scene editing. RAM3D takes multiview images of a\nstatic scene as input, along with text prompts specifying\nwhich object to erase and what should replace it. Our ap-\nproach comprises four key steps: 1) we use LangSAM [24]\nwith the text prompts to detect and segment the object to\nbe erased. 2) To erase the object, we propose a text-guided\n3D inpainting technique to fill in the background.\nWe train RAM3D for 20,000 training steps, during both\nErase and Replace training stages, which takes approxi-\nmately 12 hours on a single 32GB V100 GPU. The output\nof Replace stage training is a set of multiview images which\nmatch the input scene images on the visible region, and con-\ntain inpainted content on the interior of the masked region\nwhich is consistent across views. To obtain novel views, we\ntrain standard novel view synthesis methods using RAM3D\nedited images and the original scene cameras poses as train-\ning datasets. We use nerf-pytorch [54] for the LLFF scenes\n(STATUE ,FERN ,RED-NET SCENES ), and Gaussian Splat-\nting [15] for the GARDEN scene.

Thus, we\nmainly show various types of qualitative experiments in the F ERN scene, we create user-annotated\nmasks in a consistent position across the dataset images,\ncovering an unoccupied area of the scene.\nB.4. Cropping the denoiser inputs\nThe LDM denoising U-net takes input images of size\n512\u00d7512. In contrast, RAM3D model outputs are of equal\nresolution to the input scene images, which can be non-\nsquare. To ensure size compatibility, we need to crop and\nresize the RAM3D outputs to 512 \u00d7512 before passing them\nto the denoiser (Fig 2). For the STATUE and GARDEN scenes,\nwe resize all images to height 512 and take a centre-crop of\n512\u00d7512, which always contains the entire object mask re-gion. For the RED-NET scene, the object mask is positioned\non the left side of the images; we therefore select the left-\nmost 512 pixels for cropping.\nFor the FERN scene, input images are annotated with\nsmall user-provided masks. We find that the previous ap-\nproach provides too small of a mask region to the LDM\u2019s\ndenoiser. In this case, we train RAM3D using the origi-\nnal dataset downsampled by a factor of 2 to a resolution of\n2016\u00d71512, and select a rectangular crop around the object\nmask. We compute the tightest rectangular crop which cov-\ners the mask region,", " Introduction\nThe recent advancement of computer vision has been\nlargely relying on the scaling of training data [26, 53].

Most of the large\ndatasets are synthetic 3D data [5, 14, 22, 76] and a mix of\nsynthetic data and real-world object scans [16], given it is\nmuch less labor intensive for scaling by rendering from sim-\nulation. However, it remains a big challenge to apply the\nmodel trained in simulation data to the real world. This is\nnot only because the synthetic data has less realistic tex-\nture and shape, but also due to it is very hard to model the\ncluttered background depths.

Its remarkable\nability to model complex 3D scenes and render their photo-realistic\nnovel views has led to its adoption in a wide range of practical\napplications including VR/AR\u2217, gaming\u2020, VFX\u2021, among others.\nWith that comes increasing demands from creators to edit the neural\nimplicit fields according to their preferences. However, editing such\nvolumetric representations is challenging due to the implicit encod-\ning of scene appearance within neural features and network weights,\nwhich can hardly support intuitive and precise modifications. Re-\ncent research has sought to address this by enabling appearance\nediting of neural implicit fields, guided by various inputs such as\nan exemplar image [Bao et al .2023; Kobayashi et al .2022; Liu et al .\n2021; Wang et al .2022; Yang et al .2022], a text prompt [Bao et al .\n2023; Haque et al .2023; Jiang et al .2023; Kobayashi et al .2022; Wang\net al.2022, 2023], or a palette [Gong et al .2023; Kuang et al .2023;\n\u2217https://www.lifewire.com/nvidias-instant-nerf-can-turn-your-phots-into-3d-scenes-\nin-seconds-5224116\n\u2020https://neuralradiancefields.io/nerfs-in-unreal-engine-5-alpha-announced-by-luma-\nai\n\u2021https://www.wrapbook.com/blog/neural-radiance-fieldsarXiv:2312.02157v1  [cs.CV]  4 Dec 2023111:2 \u2022Can Wang, Mingming He, Menglei Chai, Dongdong Chen, and Jing Liao\nWu et al .2022]. These approaches primarily focus on editing ap-\npearance features or color styles of neural implicit fields, or making\nminor geometry adjustments but do not offer extensive support for\nnon-rigid deformation or topology modification.\nA more desirable approach to editing the neural implicit field is\nto make it as user-friendly as manipulating an explicit mesh in tradi-\ntional graphics workflows, ensuring compatibility with popular 3D\nsoftware like Maya, Blender, and more. Unlike a 3D mesh, the neural\nimplicit field lacks an explicit shape for artists to manipulate directly,\nbut it offers the capability of achieving photo-realistic rendering\nwith high-fidelity scene details, a significant difference from the ren-\ndering of user-edited 3D meshes. Rendering 3D-edited meshes faces\nchallenges in managing multiple aspects simultaneously, including background, like the Gundam in Fig. 1 and the sculpture in\nFig. 16.\nMoreover, our approach advances both the fine-grained editing methods.\nWhile our approach excels in managing intricate geometric and\ncolor details, it does have limitations. Firstly, our method lacks di-\nrect support for editing scene shading and lighting. Users mustinstead bake these features into the vertex colors. This limitation\nmay restrict real-time user control over these aesthetic aspects. Ad-\nditionally, our method faces challenges when editing highly intricate\nstructures that cannot produce a high-quality surface mesh, such as\nhuman hair. In such scenarios, due to the lack of a reliable under-\nlying structure, our method may struggle to edit the specific part,111:12 \u2022Can Wang, Mingming He, Menglei Chai, Dongdong Chen, and Jing Liao\nSource Mesh User Edits Source Rendered RELATED WORK\n2.1 Neural Implicit Fields Editing\nNeural implicit fields are a potent representation for modeling com-\nplex 3D scenes and enabling free-view photo-realistic rendering,\nspurring extensive research in high-quality 3D reconstruction [Chen\net al.2022b,a; Jain et al .2021; M\u00fcller et al .2022; Yu et al .2021; Zhang\net al.2022], and 3D asset generation [Jain et al .2022; Niemeyer and\nGeiger 2021; Park et al .2021a,b; Poole et al .2022; Schwarz et al .\n2020].

The signal can be consid-\nered as the 3D scene represented implicitly as in NeRF or\nexplicitly as in 3D Gaussians. When part of the 3D scene is\nrepresented with high details but rendered with low resolu-\ntion or from distant positions, the disparity between the low\nsampling and high signal frequencies culminates in aliasing\nartifacts. A naive solution is to render at high resolution\nand subsequently down-scale the rendered image to a lower\nresolution. However, this solution is not viable for scenes\ncontaining both near and far regions which are very com-\nmon. Due to the inability of 3D Gaussian splatting algo-\nrithm to accommodate varying resolutions within a single\nimage, rendering the entire image with a even higher reso-\nlution for the sake of far away regions is neither time nor\nmemory efficient.\nWe postulate that the pronounced aliasing artifacts ob-\nserved when rendering with 3D Gaussians, as opposed to\nother techniques such as NeRF, are primarily attributable to\nthe splatting of small Gaussians. 3D regions with intricate\ndetails are represented with large amount of small Gaus-\nsians. When rendering these regions with low resolution\nor from a distant view, many splatted small Gaussians are\ncramped in one pixel and therefore the pixel color of this\nregion is dominated by the front-most Gaussian, even if this\nGaussian is much smaller than others and not at the center.\nThis problem is further aggravated by the low pass filter in\n[12, 19] applied to each individual Gaussian with the inten-\ntion to mitigate aliasing on edges at high resolutions. This\nproblem is explained in more detail in Sec. 3.2.\nIn addition to the aliasing artifacts, the rendering speed\nof 3D Gaussians is also affected at low resolution. The num-\nber of 3D Gaussians that need to be rendered remains con-\nstant at lower resolutions, but they are more concentrated\nto fewer pixels. The Gaussians that are splatted to the same\npixel cannot be rendered in parallel. This means that the im-\nage rendering is even slower at lower resolution in compari-\nson with NeRF rendering time that reduces linearly with de-\ncreasing resolution. Hence, although aliasing is not a prob-\nlem exclusive to 3D Gaussian splatting, it is more prominent\nand more difficult to tackle.\nContributions To mitigate the aliasing problem for 3D\nGaussian splatting, we propose a novel multi-scale 3D\nGaussians to represent the scene at different levels of de-\ntail (LOD) as shown in Fig. 2. This is inspired by the\nmipmap and LOD algorithms widely used in computer\ngraphics, which pre-computes textures and polygons at dif-\nferent scales to be rendered under different resolutions", " Introduction 2\n2. experiments indicating this implicit disentanglement of motion and content in Figure 21, where we show that\nvarying the temporal prompt while fixing random seed and spatial prompt leads to spatially similar scenes that obtain global\nmotion properties following the temporal prompt.\nE.5.5 Additional Samples on Multi-View Synthesis\nIn Figures 22 to 25, we show additional visual examples for SVD-MV , trained on our renderings of Objaverse and MVIma-\ngeNet datasets as described in Section 4.5.\n3https : / / www . dropbox . com / s / ge9e5ujwgetktms / i3d _ torchscript . pt with keyword arguments rescale=True,\nresize=True, return features=True .\n25Figure 19.

The scores gen-\nerated by the diffusion model then guide the direction of\nmodel updates. The second type [ 5,12,37,43] focuses\non conducting 2D editing based on given prompts for the\nmultiview rendering of a 3D model. This approach creates\na multi-view 2D image dataset, which is then utilized as a\ntraining target to provide guidance for the 3D model.\nOur work centers on leveraging the exemplary properties\nof Gaussian Splatting\u2019s explicit representation to enhance\n3D editing. Consequently, we do not design specific edit-\ning guidance mechanisms but instead directly employ the\nguidance Background and other non-target regions are essentially unaffected, in contrast to Instruct-Nerf2Nerf [ 12] where the entire scene undergoes\nchanges. GaussianEditor-DDS and GaussianEditor-iN2N indicate that we utilize delta denoising score [ 14] and Instruct-Nerf2Nerf [ 12]\nrespectively, as guidance for editing.\ndensification round in which a particular Gaussian point\nis produced. The initial Gaussians \u0398, are all assigned a\ngeneration of 0. During the training process for editing,\npoints generated in the k-th densification round are marked\nas generation k.\nSubsequently, we impose varying constraints on Gaus-\nsians from different generations to control their degree of\nflexibility. The older the generation, the stronger the con-\nstraints applied. Anchor loss is utilized to enforce these\nconstraints. At the beginning of training, HGS records the\nattributes of all Gaussians as anchors. These anchors are\nthen updated to reflect the current state of the Gaussians\nat each densification process. During training, MSE loss\nbetween the anchor state and the current state is employed\nto ensure that the Gaussians do not deviate too far from their\nrespective anchors:\nLP\nanchor =nX\ni=0\u03bbi(Pi\u2212\u02c6Pi)2(7)\nwhere nrepresents the total number of Gaussians and P\ndenotes a certain property of the current Gaussian, including\nelements from the set x, s, q, \u03b1, c . Here, \u02c6Prefers to the same\nproperty recorded in the anchor state. The term \u03bbiindicates\nthe strength of the anchor loss applied to the i-th Gaussian,\nwhich varies based on its generation. The overall training\nloss is defined as:\nL=LEdit+X\nP\u2208{x,s,q,\u03b1,c }\u03bbPLP\nanchor (8)\nIn this equation, \u03bbPsignifies the strength of the anchor loss\napplied to property P, andLEdit is the edit loss defined in\nSec. 3.2.This generational design in HGS prevents the issue of\nexcessive flexibility in GS when faced with stochastic loss.\nWith each densification, the anchor loss weight \u03bbifor all\nprevious generations of Gaussians is increased. As a result,\nthe fluidity of the existing generations gradually decreases\nuntil it nearly solidifies. This approach ensures stable geom-\netry formation under stochastic losses, relying on the almost\nunconstrained Gaussians from new densifications to carve\nout details. Furthermore, this method of applying anchor\nloss can effectively meet various editing needs. For instance,\nto limit changes in the original GS, one can increase the\nanchor loss weight for generation 0. Similarly, if there is no\ndesire to alter color or geometry during editing, a stronger\nanchor loss can be applied to these specific properties.\nAdditionally, to address the challenge of manually deter-\nmining a densification threshold, we regulate the densifica-\ntion process based on a percentage criterion. In this method,\nduring each densification step, we selectively densify only\nthose Gaussians whose 3D position gradients are within\nthe top k%. This strategy", " INTRODUCTION\n3D content creation is important for many applications, such as interactive gaming, cinematic arts,\nAR/VR, and simulation. However, it is still challenging and expensive to create a high-quality 3D\nasset as it requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, automating this process with generative\nmodels has become an important problem, which remains challenging due to the scarcity of data\nand the complexity of 3D representations.\nRecently, techniques based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) (Poole et al., 2022; Lin et al.,\n2023; Chen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b), also known as Score Jacobian Chaining (SJC) (Wang\net al., 2023a), have emerged as a major research direction for text-to-3D generation, as they can\nproduce high-quality and intricate 3D experiments, we find that CSD combined\nwith general negative prompts can achieve high-quality texture quality comparable to VSD.\n5 E XPERIMENTS\nWe evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Classifier Score Distillation method across three tasks:\ntext-guided 3D generation, text-guided texture synthesis, and text-guided 3D editing. We present\nqualitative and quantitative analysis for text-guided 3D generation in Sec. 5.2 and text-guided texture\nsynthesis in Sec. 5.3. To further substantiate the superiority of our approach, we conduct user\nstudies for these two tasks.

Subsequently, the\nscene is converted into a triangular mesh via differentiable surface extraction (Shen et al., 2021) and\nfurther refined using high-resolution mesh renderings by differentiable rasterization (Laine et al.,\n2020). For the NeRF generation, we utilize the DeepFloyd-IF stage-I model (StabilityAI, 2023),\nand for the mesh refinement, we use the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model (Rombach et al., 2022) to\nenable high-resolution supervision. For both stages, CSD is used instead of SDS.\nText-Guided Texture Synthesis Given a mesh geometry and a text prompt, we apply CSD to ob-\ntain a texture field represented by Instant-NGP (M \u00a8uller et al., 2022).

One of the pioneer works iteratively optimizes\nimage pixels by matching deep image representations derived from\nConvolutional Neural Networks between the content image and\nthe style image for artistic style transfer [ 8]. This work is later\nextended [ 9] to decompose the style into several essential factors\nfor more flexible manipulations in spatial location, scale and color.\nHowever, these optimization-based background of latent diffusion model in Section 3.1. Later,\ntaking the publicly available text-to-image diffusion model (stable\ndiffusion) as an example, the technical details of our ControlStyle\nare elaborated in Section 3.2 and 3.3. Finally, the general training\nobjective is demonstrated in Section 3.4.\n3.1 Background\nDiffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [ 13] can be classified as a\ntype of generative model, which is a parameterized Markov chain\noptimized to produce samples matching a target data distribution\nwithin finite timesteps \ud835\udc47. In general, DDPM gradually adds noise\nto the data and finally destroys the data in compliance with a pre-\ndefined variance schedule {\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc47\n1in a forward diffusion process.\nConversely, in the reverse process, DDPM endeavors to reconstruct\nthe original data by predicting the added noise and remove it in a\nprogressive manner. Specifically, given the input data \ud835\udc65(also de-\nnoted as\ud835\udc650), the noisy sample \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61at an arbitrary timestep \ud835\udc61can bederived by\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61=\u221a\u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc650+\u221a1\u2212\u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf16, (1)\nwhere\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61=1\u2212\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc61,\u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc61\u00ce\n\ud835\udc60=1\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc60and\ud835\udf16\u223cN( 0,I).

This ability requires extensive\nknowledge of the 3D world.\nRecently, the field of 3D generation has experienced\nrapid and flourishing development with the introduction of\ndiffusion models. A growing body of research [5, 29, 43,\n59, 63], such as DreamField [24], DreamFusion [43], and\nMagic3D [29], resort to distilling prior knowledge of 2D\nimage diffusion models or vision language models to create\n3D models from text or images via Score Distillation Sam-\npling (SDS) [43]. Despite their compelling experiments using the complex\nlion model, which is rich in geometric details, as illustrated\nin Figure 8. The baseline model\u2019s surfaces exhibited numer-\nous holes and noises. Utilizing either the geometry-aware\nnormal loss or the outlier-dropping loss helps mitigate the\nnoisy surfaces. Finally, combining both strategies yields the\nbest performance, resulting in clean surfaces while preserv-\ning detailed geometries.\nGeneralization. To demonstrate the generalization capabil-\nity of our method, we conducted evaluations using diverse\nimage styles, including sketches, cartoons, and images of\nanimals, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 10. Despite varia-\ntions in lighting effects and geometric complexities among\nthese images, our method consistently generated multi-view\nnormal maps and color images, ultimately yielding high-\nquality geometries.\n6. discussion.\nDomain Switcher. To overcome these difficulties men-\ntioned above, we design a cross-domain diffusion scheme\nvia a domain switcher , denoted as s. The switcher sis a\none-dimensional vector that labels different domains, and\nwe further feed the switcher into the diffusion model as an\nextra input. Therefore, the formulation of Eq. 2 can be ex-\ntended as:\nn1:K, x1:K=f(y,\u03c01:K, sn), f(y,\u03c01:K, sc). (5)\nThe domain switcher sis first encoded via positional en-\ncoding [39] and subsequently concatenated with the time\nembedding. This combined representation is then injected\ninto the UNet of the stable diffusion models. Interestingly, Experiments\n5.1. Implementation Details\nWe train our model on the LVIS subset of the Obja-\nverse dataset [9], which comprises approximately 30,000+\nobjects following a cleanup process. Surprisingly, even\nwith fine-tuning on this relatively small-scale dataset, our\nmethod demonstrates robust generalization capabilities. To\ncreate the rendered multi-view dataset, we first normalized\neach object to be centered and of unit scale. Then we render\nnormal maps and color images from six views, including\nthe front, back, left, right, front-right, and front-left views,\nusing Blenderproc [11]. Additionally, to enhance dataset di-\nversity, we applied random rotations to the 3D assets during\nthe rendering process.We fine-tune our model starting from the Stable Diffu-\nsion Image Variations Model, which has previously been\nfine-tuned with image conditions. We retain the optimizer\nsettings and \u03f5-prediction strategy from the previous fine-\ntuning. During fine-tuning, we use a reduced image size\nof 256 \u00d7256 and a total batch size of 512 for training. The\nfine-tuning process involves training the model for 30,000\nsteps. This entire training procedure typically requires ap-\nproximately 3 days on a cluster of 8 Nvidia Tesla A800\nGPUs. To reconstruct 3D geometry from the 2D represen-\ntations, our method is built on the instant-NGP based SDF\nreconstruction method [19].\n5.2.

By capturing multi-view images of a 3D scene and us-\ning off-the-shelf structure-from-motion models to estimate camera\nposes, one can train neural networks to learn neural fields that\nimplicitly represent the geometry and texture of the scene. Com-\npared to the traditional pipeline involving tedious 3D matching and\ncomplex postprocessing steps, neural fields offer a more efficient\nand accessible approach for reconstructing real-world objects and\nscenes into Computer Graphics assets for general users.\nHowever, editing neural fields is not a straightforward task since\nthe shape and texture information is implicitly encoded within high-\ndimensional neural network features. Conventional 3D modeling\ntechniques are ineffective for manual sculpting and re-texturing\nsince explicit geometry is not available. Previous research has ex-\nplored techniques for neural fields editing, such as moving objects\nin a scene [Chen et al .2021], modifying textures [Xiang et al .2021],\nand altering object shape [Yang et al .2022]. However, these editing\nprocedures still require extensive user input. While recent work\nhas enabled NeRF editing with text prompts [Haque et al .2023],\nit struggles to achieve precise and high-quality editing due to a\nrestricted diversity of instructions. Consequently, further research\nis needed to develop easy-to-use andaccurate 3D editing methods, such as BakedSDF [Yariv et al .2023], our\nmethod can be extended to the whole scene editing. results.SA Conference Papers \u201923, December 12\u201315, 2023, Sydney, NSW, Australia Zhuang et al.

Given a few images of the same\nsubject, DreamBooth embeds the subject into a T2I diffusion model\nby binding it to a unique identifier (denoted as \u2217). It uses an L2\nreconstruction loss to fine-tune the diffusion model on the input\nimages and a class prior-preserving loss to prevent overfitting.

In contrast, recent ad-\nvances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [33] have shown\npromising progress in representing 3D environments using\nimplicit representations [14, 21, 33, 37] combined with vol-\nume rendering techniques that enable high-quality novel\nview synthesis. NeRF-based 3D GANs [4, 5, 11, 16, 36, 43,\n50,52] have made further progress towards generating a cat-\negory of 3D aware contents with a single model, extending\nthe per-scene optimization scheme of NeRF.\nSeveral studies [29,44,45,48] have attempted to address\nthe challenges of NeRF editing, yet certain limitations per-\nsist. Works such as Edit-NeRF [29] and CLIP-NeRF [48]\nhave pioneered NeRF manipulations, but they are con-\nstrained to low-resolution synthetic datasets and lack the\ncapability to perform localized editing. Opposed to trans-\nlation [9, 53] or style transfer [13] tasks, editing typicallydemands a certain degree of localization. However, achiev-\ning this with text-only control proves to be a challenging\nobjective. Alternative methods require either inversion steps which cannot\nbe done in real-time or an encoding step which degrades\nidentity preservation. LENeRF, however, can perform lo-\ncalized editing in real-time and preserve the quality and the\nidentity of original content.\nFig. 5 shows partial editing results. Related Work\n3D-Aware GANs While Generative Adversarial Net-\nworks (GANs) [15] have demonstrated their ability to gen-\nerate high-quality 2D images, generating 3D-aware content\nwith GANs remains a challenging task. Several approaches\nhave attempted to integrate GANs and 3D scene representa-\ntions [34,35]. Recent progress in 3D GANs [4,5,11,16,27,\n36, 43, 50, 52] that employ NeRF [33] have achieved suc-\ncess in generating high-quality, multi-view consistent im-\nages. Building upon the progress made by previous research\nin this \ufb01eld, our work seeks to enhance its applicability by\nintroducing a novel method for text-guided local editing.\nNeRF Manipulations To enable local editing in 3D assets,\nEditNeRF [29] proposes a conditional NeRF that enables\nusers to modify the color and shape of a speci\ufb01c region us-\ning scribbles. However, the editing ability of EditNeRF is\nlimited to adding or removing local parts of 3D objects. Se-\nmantic mask guided 3D editing approaches [22, 29, 44, 46]\nhave made some progress in 3D editing. Among these\nworks, FENeRF [45] is trained to render 3D images and\ntheir corresponding semantic masks, allowing editing to\nbe performed by inverting the model with edited semantic\nmasks to modify 3D models. However, using a 2D mask\nfor 3D editing is suboptimal since \ufb01ne-grained attributes\nsuch as expression or texture cannot be manipulated using\nmasks. Also, these Results on comparison of pixel-wise difference maps.\nFigure 11.

We observed that while integrating\nthe z-variance loss Lzvarsharpens the density distribution along the rays, it also intensifies the flick-\nering appearance. We consider the issue arising from the increased challenges of estimating the\nPDF of volume density along these rays. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective kernel\nsmoothing (KS) technique for coarse-to-fine importance sampling during rendering. Specifically,\nthe KS approach involves a weighted moving average of neighboring PDF values estimated during\nthe coarse stage. The weight is defined by a sliding window kernel. This ensures a broader sam-\npling scope near the high-density regions in the refined stage.

Their pivotal role extends across a\nwide array of domains, encompassing architecture, animation, gaming, and the rapidly evolving fields\nof virtual and augmented reality. In spite of the extensive applications, the production of premium 3D\ncontent often remains a formidable task. It necessitates a significant investment of time and effort,\neven when undertaken by professional designers. This challenge has prompted the development of\ntext-to-3D methods, and\nwe use the same setting of CFG (e.g. 7.5) as the common text-to-image generation task for the best\nperformance. To the best of our knowledge, this for the first time addresses the problem in previous\nSDS [ 34,20,4,29] that it usually requires a large CFG (i.e., 100). Specifically, SDS (Eq. (3)) uses\n(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5)while VSD (Eq. (9))) uses (\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y )). For example,\nfor the 2D special case of g(\u03b8, c)\u2261\u03b8, we have \u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)]and\n\u2207\u03b8LVSD(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y ))]. Intuitively, to obtain highly detailed\nsamples, the updating direction for \u03b8needs to be \u201cfine\u201d and \u201csharp\u201d. As SDS only depends on \u03f5pretrain ,\nit needs a large CFG ( = 100 ) to make sure \u03f5pretrain to be \u201csharp\u201d enough; however, large CFG, in turn,\nreduces the diversity of the results of ProlificDreamer compared with baselines.\n36 Background\nWe present preliminaries on diffusion models, score distillation sampling, and 3D representations.\nDiffusion models. A diffusion model [ 46,14,49] involves a forward process {qt}t\u2208[0,1]to gradually\nadd noise to a data point x0\u223cq0(x0)and a reverse process {pt}t\u2208[0,1]to denoise/generate data. The\nforward process is defined by qt(xt|x0):=N(\u03b1tx0, \u03c32\ntI)andqt(xt):=R\nqt(xt|x0)q0(x0)dx0,\nwhere \u03b1t, \u03c3t>0are hyperparameters satisfying \u03b10\u22481, \u03c30\u22480, \u03b11\u22480, \u03c31\u22481; and the reverse\nprocess is defined by denoising from p1(x1):=N(0,I)with a parameterized noise prediction\n2A prolific dreamer is someone who experiences vivid dreams quite regularly [ 50], which corresponds to the\nhigh-fidelity and diverse Appendix G to demonstrate the scalability of VSD.\nWe leave the experiments. As shown\nin Table 5, VSD with 4 particles slightly outperforms VSD with 1 particles in the 3D setting; and as\nshown in Table 6, VSD with 8 particles slightly outperforms VSD with 4 particles in the 2D setting.\n29Table 6: 2D sample quality by different samplers, 1000 prompts.\nMethod SDS VSD (n=4) VSD (n=8) DPM++\nFID ( \u2193) 90.09 68.02 66.68 47.91\nVSD outperforms SDS in 2D. As shown in Table 6, the FID by VSD is much better than SDS. As\nthe 2D setting isolates the sampling algorithm from the 3D representations, we can directly compare\ndifferent sampling algorithms, finding that VSD can get better sample quality than SDS (though still\nworse than SOTA diffusion samplers, it can generalize to 3D cases).\nL Why using SDS in stage-2 for the geometry optimization of mesh?\nVSD can also be used to generate geometry. To validate this, we provide an ablation example in\nFig. 21 (3a),(3b). As shown in the figure, VSD can obtain reasonable geometry. Although the some\npart of the geometry from VSD is with more details than SDS (including the tail of the horse), on\nthe whole, the result from VSD is similar with SDS.

Due to diverse demands\nfrom different \ufb01elds, video segmentation models are required to support multiple interaction modes.\nTherefore, it is divided into several subtasks, i.e, unsupervised (automatic) video segmentation [4, 10,\n13\u201315], semi-supervised (mask-guided semi-automatic) video segmentation [9,16 \u201319,21], interactive\n(scribble or click based) video segmentation [2], and language-induced video segmentation [7].\nEach subtask has its corresponding segmentation mode and focuses on speci\ufb01c \ufb01elds.

The Results\nWe", " Introduction\nWith the emergence of efficient neural 3D reconstruc-\ntion techniques, capturing a realistic digital representation\nof a real-world 3D scene has never been easier. The pro-\ncess is simple: capture a collection of images of a scenefrom varying viewpoints, reconstruct their camera param-\neters, and use the posed images to optimize a Neural Ra-\ndiance Field [26]. Due to its ease of use, we expect cap-\ntured 3D content to gradually replace the traditional pro-\ncesses of manually-generated assets. Unfortunately, while\nthe pipelines for turning a real scene into a 3D representa-\ntion are relatively mature and accessible, many of the other\nnecessary tools for the creation of 3D assets (e.g., those\nneeded for editing 3D scenes) remain underdeveloped.\nTraditional processes for editing 3D models involve spe-\ncialized tools and years of training in order to manually\nsculpt, extrude, and re-texture a given object. This pro-\ncess is made even more involved with the advent of neural\nrepresentations, which often do not have explicit surfaces.\nThis further motivates the need for 3D editing approaches\ndesigned for the modern era of 3D representations, particu-\nlarly approaches that are similarly as accessible as the cap-\nture techniques themselves.\nTo this end, we propose Instruct-NeRF2NeRF, a method\nfor editing 3D NeRF scenes that requires as input only a\n1arXiv:2303.12789v2  [cs.CV]  1 Jun 2023InstructPix2Pix\nOriginal Dataset Image\nText Prompt\nCurrent NeRF Render Noise\u201cTurn the bear into a grizzly bear\u201dConditioning\nSignalDataset Update\nFigure 2: Overview : Our method gradually updates a reconstructed NeRF scene by iteratively updating the dataset images while training\nthe NeRF: (1) an image is rendered from the scene at a training viewpoint, (2) it is edited by InstructPix2Pix given a global text instruction,\n(3) the training dataset image is replaced with the edited image, and (4) the NeRF continues training as usual.\ntext instruction. Our approach operates on a pre-captured\n3D scene and ensures that the resulting edits are reflected\nin a 3D-consistent manner. For example, given a 3D scene\ncapture of a person shown in Figure 1 (left), we can enable\na wide variety of edits using flexible and expressive textual\ninstruction such as \u201cGive him a cowboy hat\u201d or\u201cTurn\nhim into Albert Einstein\u201d . Our approach makes 3D scene\nediting accessible and intuitive for everyday users.\nThough there exist 3D generative models, the data-\nsources required for training these models at scale are still\nlimited. Therefore, we instead choose to extract shape and\nappearance priors from a 2D diffusion model. Specifically,\nwe employ a recent image-conditioned diffusion model,\nInstructPix2Pix [2], which enables instruction-based 2D\nimage editing. Unfortunately, applying this model on\nindividual images rendered from a reconstructed NeRF\nproduces inconsistent edits across viewpoints. As a solution\nto this, we devise a simple approach similar to recent 3D\ngeneration solutions like DreamFusion [33]. Our underly-\ning method, which we refer to as Iterative Dataset Update\n(Iterative DU), alternates between editing the \u201cdataset\u201d\nof NeRF input images, and updating the underlying 3D\nrepresentation to incorporate the edited images.\nWe evaluate our approach on a variety of captured NeRF\nscenes, validating our design choices by comparing with ab-\nlated variants of our method, as well as na \u00a8\u0131ve implementa-\ntions of the score distillation sampling (SDS) loss proposed\nin DreamFusion [33]. We also qualitatively compare our ap-\nproach to a concurrent text-based stylization approach [47].\nWe demonstrate that our method can accomplish a wide va-\nriety of edits on people, objects, and", " Introduction\nArt is a reflection of the figments of human imagination.\nWhile many are limited in their practical creative capabili-\nties, by pushing the boundaries of digital media, new ways\ncan be created for casual artists and experts alike to express\ntheir ideas. At the same time, current neural generative art\ntakes away much of the control from humans. In this work,\nwe attempt to take a step towards restoring some of that\ncontrol, enabling neural networks to complement users and\nnaturally extend their skills rather than taking hold over the\ngenerative process.\nThe field of image synthesis has been significantly pro-\npelled by neural generative models, particularly by the lat-\nest text-to-image models that predominantly rely on large\nlanguage-image models [3, 54, 55, 56].

In this paper, we aim to develop\na strong system to detect arbitrary objects specified by human language inputs,\na task commonly referred to as open-set object detection2. The task has wide\napplications for its great potential as a generic object detector. For example, we\ncan cooperate with generative models for image editing (as shown in Fig. 1 (b)).\nIn pursuit of this goal, we design the strong open-set object detector Ground-\ning DINO by following the two principles: tight modality fusion based on\nDINO [57] and large-scale grounded pre-train for concept generalization.\nTight modality fusion based on DINO. The key to open-set detection\nis introducing language for unseen object generalization [1,7,25]. Most existing\nopen-set detectors are developed by extending closed-set detectors to open-set\nscenarios with language information. As shown in Fig. 2, a closed-set detector\ntypically has three important modules, a backbone for feature extraction, a neck\nfor feature enhancement, and a head for region refinement (or box prediction).\nA closed-set detector can be generalized to detect novel objects by learning\nlanguage-aware region embeddings so that each region can be classified into novel\ncategories in a language-aware semantic space. The key to achieving this goal is\nusing contrastive loss between region outputs and language features at the neck\nand/or head outputs.\nBackbone\n(ResNet,Swin ,\u2026)Neck\n(DyHead,Encoder ,\u2026)Head\n(ROIHead , Decoder, \u2026)\nImage \nFeaturesRefined\nImage \nFeaturesQuery \nInitOutput\nRegions Closed -Set \nDetectorText EncoderOpen -Set \nDetector\nFeature \nFusion AContrastive \nLoss AFeature \nFusion BFeature \nFusion CContrastive \nLoss BText Features\nFig. 2:Extending closed-set detectors to open-set scenarios.To help a model\nalign cross-modality\ninformationsomework\ntried to fuse features\nbefore the final loss\nstage. We summarize\nthe modulized design\n1In this paper, \u2018zero-shot\u2019 refers to scenarios where the training split of the test dataset\nis not utilized in the training process.\n2We view the terms open-set object detection ,open-world object detection , and open-\nvocabulary object detection the same task in this paper. To avoid confusion, we always\nuseopen-set object detection in our paper.Grounding DINO 3\nof object detectors in Fig. 2. Feature fusion can be performed in three phases:\nneck (phase A), query initialization (phase B), and head (phase C). For example,\nGLIP [25] performs early fusion in the neck module (phase A), and OV-DETR [55]\nuses language-aware queries as head inputs (phase B). We argue that introducing\nmore feature fusion into the pipeline can facilitate better alignment between\ndifferent modality features, thereby achieving better performance.\nAlthough conceptually simple, it is hard for previous work to perform feature\nfusion in all three phases. The design of classical detectors like Faster RCNN\nmakes it hard to interact with language information in most blocks. Unlike\nclassical detectors, the Transformer-based detector method such as DINO has a\nconsistent structure with language blocks. The layer-by-layer design enables it to\ninteract with language information easily. Under this principle, we design three\nfeature fusion approaches in the neck, query initialization, and head phases. More\nspecifically, we design a feature enhancer by stacking self-attention, text-to-image\ncross-attention, and image-to-text cross-attention as the neck module. We then\ndevelop a language-guided query selection method to initialize queries for the\ndetection head. We also design a cross-modality decoder for the head phase with\nimage and text cross-attention layers to boost query representations.\nLarge-scale grounded pre-train for zero-shot transfer.

Since\ntraining data for this task is dif\ufb01cult to acquire at scale,\nwe propose an approach for generating a paired dataset\nthat combines multiple large models pretrained on different\nmodalities: a large language model (GPT-3 [7]) and a text-\nto-image model (Stable Diffusion [52]). These two models\ncapture complementary knowledge about language and im-\nages that can be combined to create paired training data for\na task spanning both modalities.\nUsing our generated paired data, we train a conditional\ndiffusion model that, given an input image and a text in-\nstruction for how to edit it, generates the edited image. Our\nmodel directly performs the image edit in the forward pass,\nand does not require any additional example images, full de-\nscriptions of the input/output images, or per-example \ufb01ne-\ntuning. Despite being trained entirely on synthetic exam-\nples (i.e., both generated written instructions and generated\n1arXiv:2211.09800v2  [cs.CV]  18 Jan 2023imagery), our model achieves zero-shot generalization to\nboth arbitrary real images and natural human-written in-\nstructions. Our model enables intuitive image editing that\ncan follow human instructions to perform a diverse collec-\ntion of edits: replacing objects, changing the style of an im-\nage, changing the setting, the artistic medium, among oth-\ners. Selected examples can be found in Figure 1.\n2. Prior work\nComposing large pretrained models Recent work has\nshown that large pretrained models can be combined to\nsolve multimodal tasks that no one model can perform\nalone, such as image captioning and visual question an-\nswering (tasks that require the knowledge of both a large\nlanguage model and a text-image model). Techniques for\ncombining pretrained models include joint \ufb01netuning on a\nnew task [4, 34, 41, 68], communication through prompt-\ning [63, 70], composing probability distributions of energy-\nbased models [11, 38], guiding one model with feedback\nfrom another [62], and iterative optimization [35]. Our\nmethod is similar to prior work in that it leverages the com-\nplementary abilities of two pretrained models\u2014GPT-3 [7])\nand Stable Diffusion [52]\u2014but differs in that we use these\nmodels to generate paired multi-modal training data.\nDiffusion-based generative models Recent advances in\ndiffusion models [60] have enabled state-of-the-art image\nsynthesis [10, 18, 19, 54, 56, 61] as well as generative mod-\nels of other modalities such as video [21, 59], audio [31],\ntext [36] and network parameters [46]. Recent text-to-\nimage diffusion models [42, 49, 52, 55] have shown to gen-\nerate realistic images from arbitrary text captions.\nGenerative models for image editing Image editing\nmodels traditionally targeted a single editing task such as\nstyle transfer [15, 16] or translation between image do-\nmains [22, 24, 37, 43, 72].

Adapting this approach to 3D synthe-\nsis would require large-scale datasets of labeled 3D data and ef\ufb01cient architectures\nfor denoising 3D data, neither of which currently exist.

NeRF encodes the vol-\numetric density and color of a scene within the weights of\na coordinate-based multi-layer perceptron. Several follow-\nup works extend original NeRF to handle different tasks,\nsuch as pose estimation [18, 38], 3D-aware image synthe-\nsis [4, 25, 32], deformable 3D reconstruction [20, 26, 29],\nand modeling dynamic scenes [10, 12, 39].\nThough NeRF achieves great performance on photo-\nrealistic scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis,\nthere remain enormous challenges in editing the geome-\ntries and appearances of a scene represented by a pre-trained\nNeRF model. Unlike traditional image editing, a user needs\nto transfer his/her edits on a rendered view to the NeRF\nmodel to edit the whole scene, thus introducing multiple\nchallenges. First, it is unclear where the edited regions ap-\npear on other rendered views. Second, because millions of\nparameters are used in a pre-trained NeRF model, it is un-\nclear which parameters control the different aspects of the\nrendered shape and how to change the parameters according\nto the sparse local user input.

Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) [27] allow for ef\ufb01cient sampling of high resolution\nimages with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are dif\ufb01-\n2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full\ndata distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth-\nods emphasize good density estimation which renders op-\ntimization more well-behaved.

To scale to higher resolutions, several\ntwo-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model\na compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels.\nRecently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82],\nhave achieved state-of-the-art methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(zjx) =\nN(z;E\u0016;E\u001b2)and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0;1)as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu-\nlarizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of jZjdifferent exemplars [96].\nTo obtain high-\ufb01delity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the\nKLterm by a factor\u001810\u00006or choose a high codebook dimensionality jZj.\nThe full objective to train the autoencoding model (E;D)reads:\nLAutoencoder = min\nE;Dmax\n \u0010\nLrec(x;D(E(x)))\u0000Ladv(D(E(x))) + logD (x) +Lreg(x;E;D)\u0011\n(25)\nDM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two\ncases when learning p(z)orp(zjy)(Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we sample z=E\u0016(x)+E\u001b(x)\u0001\"=:E(x),\nwhere\"\u0018N(0;1). When rescaling the latent, we estimate the component-wise variance\n^\u001b2=1\nbchwX\nb;c;h;w(zb;c;h;w\u0000^\u0016)2\nfrom the \ufb01rst batch in the data, where ^\u0016=1\nbchwP\nb;c;h;wzb;c;h;w. The output ofEis scaled such that the rescaled latent has\nunit standard deviation, i.e.z z\n^\u001b=E(x)\n^\u001b. (ii) For a VQ-regularized latent space, we extract zbefore the quantization layer\nand absorb the quantization operation into the decoder, i.e. it can be interpreted as the \ufb01rst layer of D.\nH.

In the deep learning era, many\nIQA approaches [12, 34, 36, 43, 49] have achieved signi\ufb01-\ncant success by leveraging the power of convolutional neu-\nral networks (CNNs). However, the CNN-based IQA mod-\nels are often constrained by the \ufb01xed-size input requirement\nin batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized\nor cropped to a \ufb01xed shape as shown in Figure 1 (b). This\npreprocessing is problematic for IQA because images in the\nwild have varying aspect ratios and resolutions. Resizing\nand cropping can impact image composition or introduce\ndistortions, thus changing the quality of the image.\nTo learn IQA on the full-size image, the existing CNN-\nbased approaches use either adaptive pooling or resizing to\nget a \ufb01xed-size convolutional feature map. MNA-CNN [25]\n1Checkpoints and code are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/google-research/tree/master/musiq\nFigure 1. In CNN-based models (b), images need to be resized or\ncropped to a \ufb01xed shape for batch training. However, such prepro-\ncessing can alter image aspect ratio and composition, thus impact-\ning image quality. Our patch-based MUSIQ model (a) can process\nthe full-size image and extract multi-scale features, which aligns\nwith the human visual system.\nprocesses a single image in each training batch which is not\npractical for training on a large dataset. Hosu et al. [16]\nextracts and stores \ufb01xed-size features of\ufb02ine, which costs\nadditional storage for every augmented image. To keep as-\npect ratio, Chen et al. [7] proposes a dedicated convolu-\ntion to preserve aspect ratio in the convolutional receptive\n\ufb01eld. Its evaluation veri\ufb01es the importance of aspect-ratio-\npreserving (ARP) in the IQA tasks. But it still needs resiz-\ning and smart grouping for effective batch training.\nIn this paper, we propose a patch-based multi-scale im-\nage quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to bypass the CNN con-\nstraints on \ufb01xed input size and predict the quality effectively\non the native resolution image as shown in Figure 1 (a).\nTransformer [38] is \ufb01rst proposed for natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) and has recently been studied for various vi-\nsion tasks [4\u20136, 11]. Among these, the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) [11] splits each image into a sequence of \ufb01xed-size\npatches, encodes each patch as a token, and then appliesarXiv:2108.05997v1  [cs.CV]  12 Aug 2021Transformer to the sequence for image classi\ufb01cation. In\ntheory, such kind of patch-based Transformer models can\nhandle arbitrary numbers of patches (up to memory con-\nstraints), and therefore do not require preprocessing the in-\nput image to a \ufb01xed resolution. This motivates us to apply\nthe patch-based Transformer on the IQA tasks with the full-\nsize images as input.\nAnother aspect for improving IQA models is to imi-\ntate the human visual system which captures an image in\na multi-scale fashion [1]. Previous works [16, 22, 48]\nhave shown the bene\ufb01t of using multi-scale features ex-\ntracted from CNN feature maps at different depths. This\ninspires us to transform the native resolution image into a\nmulti-scale representation, enabling the Transformer\u2019s self-\nattention mechanism to capture information on both \ufb01ne-\ngrained detailed patches and coarse-grained global patches.\nBesides, unlike the convolution operation in CNNs that has\na relatively limited receptive \ufb01eld, self-attention can attend\nto the whole input sequence and it can therefore effectively\ncapture the image quality at different granularities.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to apply the Trans-\nformer on the multi-aspect-ratio multi-scale input.

The Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) ap-\nproach [ 24] models the radiance \ufb01eld and density of a scene\nwith the weights of a neural network. V olume rendering is\nthen used to synthesize new views, demonstrating a hereto-\nfore unprecedented level of \ufb01delity on a range of challenging\nscenes. However, NeRF has only been demonstrated to work\n*Denotes equal contribution.\n(a) Photos (b) Renderings\nFigure 1: Given only an internet photo collection (a), our method\nis able to render novel views with variable illumination (b).

As we will\ndemonstrate, NeRF\u2019s performance degrades signi\ufb01cantly\nwhen presented with moving objects or variable illumina-\ntion. This limitation prohibits direct application of NeRF to\nlarge-scale in-the-wild scenarios, where input images may\nbe taken hours or years apart, and may contain pedestrians\nand vehicles moving through them.\nThe central limitation of NeRF that we address here is its\nassumption that the world is geometrically, materially, and\nphotometrically static \u2014 that the density and radiance of\nthe world is constant. NeRF therefore requires that any two\nphotographs taken at the same position and orientation must\nbe identical. This assumption is severely violated in many\nreal-world datasets, such as large-scale internet photo collec-\ntions of tourist landmarks. Two photographers may stand in\nthe same location and photograph the same landmark, but\nin the time between those two photographs the world can\nchange signi\ufb01cantly: cars and people may move, construc-\ntion may begin or end, seasons and weather may change,\nthe sun may move through the sky, etc. Even two photos\n1arXiv:2008.02268v3  [cs.CV]  6 Jan 2021taken at the same time and location can exhibit considerable\nvariation: exposure, color correction, and tone-mapping all\nmay vary depending on the camera and post-processing. We\nwill demonstrate that naively applying NeRF to in-the-wild\nphoto collections results from Related Work\nThe last decade has seen the integration of physics-based\nmulti-view geometry techniques into deep learning-based\napproaches for the task of 3D scene reconstruction.
