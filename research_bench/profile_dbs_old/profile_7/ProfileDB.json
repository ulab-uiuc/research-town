    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of autonomous driving through innovative frameworks and predictive models. My recent work centers around DualAD, a novel autonomous driving system that emulates human reasoning. This framework integrates a rule-based motion planner with a text encoder that translates driving scenarios into natural language, allowing a large language model (LLM) to make informed driving decisions. This dual-layer approach not only enhances routine driving tasks but also improves decision-making in critical situations, demonstrating significant performance gains over traditional rule-based systems.\n\nIn addition to DualAD, I have tackled the challenges of long-term prediction in emergency driving scenarios through the development of the Extro-Spective Prediction (ESP) dataset. This dataset addresses the complexities of predicting rare but critical events, and I introduced a flexible feature encoder that seamlessly integrates with various prediction methods. My work also includes the creation of a new evaluation metric, clamped temporal error (CTE), which provides a nuanced assessment of prediction performance in time-sensitive situations.\n\nI am passionate about bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world applications in autonomous driving, and I am committed to sharing my findings with the community by making datasets and benchmarks publicly available. My research aims to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, paving the way for a future where autonomous vehicles can navigate complex environments with human-like reasoning.",
