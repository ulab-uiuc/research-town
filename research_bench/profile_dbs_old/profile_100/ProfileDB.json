    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing statistical methodologies and machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of anomaly detection, contextual bandits, and high-dimensional data analysis. My recent work has focused on developing innovative approaches for detecting anomalous patterns in various data types, including images and tensors, using multiscale scan statistics. I have also explored the challenges posed by biased sampling and missing data, proposing robust methods like nearest neighbor matching (NNM) to improve estimates in these contexts.\n\nMy research extends to high-dimensional heteroscedastic regression, where I have introduced non-convex penalized estimators that achieve oracle properties, and I have developed methods for change-point detection in graphs, leveraging generalized likelihood ratio statistics. I am particularly interested in the intersection of graph theory and statistical inference, as evidenced by my work on the graph Fourier scan statistic, which provides a powerful tool for detecting localized activations in noisy environments.\n\nIn addition to theoretical advancements, I have applied my methodologies to practical problems, such as improving recommendation systems through listwise collaborative ranking and enhancing the robustness of contextual bandit algorithms against adversarial attacks. My goal is to create scalable, efficient algorithms that not only perform well in theory but also translate effectively to real-world applications, ultimately contributing to the fields of data science and machine learning.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of natural language processing (NLP) through innovative approaches to multilingual understanding and model adaptation. My work has focused on leveraging the similarities between languages to improve semantic dependency parsing and semantic role labeling, particularly in low-resource settings. I introduced Rosita, a method for creating multilingual contextual word representations, which has shown significant performance improvements across various NLP tasks.\n\nI have also explored the challenges of adapting language models to new domains, proposing a fully compositional output embedding layer that enhances model performance, especially for low-frequency words. My research extends into the realm of item response theory, where I developed a multistage fitting procedure that streamlines the scoring of language proficiency tests, demonstrating superior calibration and predictive performance.\n\nIn addition to these technical contributions, I am deeply concerned about the societal implications of technology, particularly regarding misinformation. My collaborative work in this area has led to insights on how technology can both propagate and mitigate false information.\n\nRecently, I have focused on improving evaluation methodologies in NLP by introducing contrast sets, which help identify systematic gaps in datasets and provide a more accurate assessment of model capabilities. Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, ensuring that NLP technologies are both effective and responsible.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of language processing, machine learning, and educational technology. My work has primarily focused on understanding how various statistical properties of language influence sentence processing, particularly through the lens of surprisal theory. I have provided evidence that local statistics, such as word bigram and trigram probabilities, play a significant role in processing difficulty, challenging the notion that only conditional probabilities matter.\n\nIn addition to theoretical insights, I have developed practical applications aimed at enhancing language learning experiences. My recent project, mHyER, addresses the challenge of zero-shot exercise retrieval, leveraging large language models to synthesize personalized exercises based on learners' natural language queries. This innovative approach bridges the semantic gap between learner input and exercise content, significantly improving retrieval effectiveness.\n\nI am also passionate about making language models more accessible for non-proficient users. My work on CALM (CEFR-Aligned Language Model) demonstrates how to control the difficulty of text generated by large language models, achieving superior performance at a fraction of the cost of existing models.\n\nFurthermore, I have contributed to the field of item response theory (IRT) by proposing a multistage fitting procedure that integrates seamlessly with automated machine learning tools. This approach enhances the calibration and predictive performance of language proficiency tests, exemplified by my work on the Duolingo English Test.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, ultimately enhancing language learning and assessment methodologies.",
