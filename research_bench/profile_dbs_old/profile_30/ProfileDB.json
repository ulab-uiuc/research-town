My recent work has led to the development of a multi-task conditional imitation learning framework that enhances both lateral and longitudinal control tasks, significantly improving interaction safety with pedestrians. I also created the IntersectNav benchmark, which provides human demonstrations to facilitate research in this area.\n\nIn addition to my work on imitation learning, I have conducted a comprehensive survey of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and deep imitation learning (DIL) techniques for deriving driving policies in autonomous vehicles.

I developed a novel probability-based global cross-modal upsampling method (PGCU) that leverages both local and global information from low-resolution multispectral images and guiding panchromatic images. My experiments demonstrate that PGCU outperforms existing methods and enhances the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in pansharpening.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and real-world applications, contributing to safer and more efficient autonomous systems.",
