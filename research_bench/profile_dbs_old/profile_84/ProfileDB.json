    "bio": "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the exploration of quantum materials and their unique properties, particularly focusing on flat-band systems and their implications in superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling. My recent work investigates the quantum geometric effects on the Higgs mode in flat-band superconductors, revealing how the quantum metric influences third-harmonic generation (THG) and providing insights into detecting Higgs modes through optical methods.\n\nIn addition to my work in condensed matter physics, I am also exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and behavioral finance through the study of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). I have developed a framework to assess the reasoning capabilities of these models, particularly in relation to behavioral biases such as recency and authority bias. My findings highlight significant biases in open-source LVLMs, offering pathways for improvement.\n\nFurthermore, I have proposed a novel model for unconventional Rashba bands, demonstrating their enhanced spin galvanic effects compared to conventional bands. This research opens new avenues for understanding spin dynamics in two-dimensional systems.\n\nLastly, I am innovating in the field of spectrum sensing with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), leveraging the eigenvalue moment ratio for efficient signal sampling. My work emphasizes low-cost, high-performance solutions in spectrum sensing, showcasing the potential of one-bit technologies in practical applications. Overall, my research spans a diverse range of topics, all aimed at uncovering the intricate relationships between quantum mechanics, materials science, and machine learning.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of large vision-language models (LVLMs) and behavioral finance. My recent work investigates the behavioral biases inherent in these models, particularly through the lens of finance and psychology. I have developed a comprehensive framework that spans data collection to innovative evaluation metrics, allowing for a nuanced assessment of LVLMs' reasoning capabilities and their susceptibility to biases such as recency bias and authority bias.\n\nIn my evaluations, I have analyzed several prominent open-source LVLMs, including LLaVA-NeXT and MobileVLM-V2, revealing significant behavioral biases that can impact their performance in real-world applications. In contrast, I found that proprietary models like GPT-4o exhibit minimal bias, underscoring the need for improvements in open-source models. My research not only highlights critical areas for enhancement but also aims to foster a deeper understanding of how these advanced models can be responsibly utilized in various domains. I am passionate about contributing to the development of more robust and fair AI systems, and I actively share my findings and code to encourage collaboration and further research in this vital area.",

    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.\n\nI am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a \"sweet spot\" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities during the aggregation process.\n\nAdditionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML), where I introduced methods like FALCON and AutoTransfer to improve the efficiency of model design searches by leveraging prior knowledge across tasks.\n\nOverall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, providing scalable solutions that push the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve in real-world scenarios. I am passionate about continuing to explore this dynamic field and contributing to its evolution.",
