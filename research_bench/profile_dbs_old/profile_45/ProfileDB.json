    "bio": "I am a researcher specializing in natural language processing (NLP) with a particular focus on machine translation (MT) and the integration of large language models (LLMs) into this domain. My recent work explores the synergy between LLMs and supervised MT systems, leveraging external feedback to enhance translation quality. By fine-tuning models like LLaMA-2, I have demonstrated significant improvements in translation metrics across multiple language pairs, including Chinese-English and English-German.\n\nI am also deeply invested in cross-lingual representation learning, where I introduced the concept of semantic leakage and developed the ORACLE training objective to improve the alignment of contextual representations in multilingual embeddings. My research extends to innovative prompting strategies, such as Cross-lingual QA, which optimize the use of in-context examples without compromising contextual integrity.\n\nAdditionally, I have addressed practical challenges in lexically-constrained neural machine translation (LNMT) by developing a homograph disambiguation module and the PLUMCOT framework, which enhances the model's ability to handle unseen lexical constraints. My work culminates in the creation of HOLLY, a benchmark for evaluating LNMT models under real-world conditions.\n\nBeyond these technical contributions, I am committed to advancing the understanding of prompting techniques in generative AI systems, establishing a structured taxonomy that clarifies the diverse methodologies in this rapidly evolving field. My goal is to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, driving innovation in multilingual NLP.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, with a particular focus on cross-lingual sentence embeddings, traffic forecasting, and machine translation. My recent work has explored the intricacies of semantic representation, leading to the development of ORACLE, a novel training objective that effectively reduces semantic leakage in multilingual embeddings. I have also tackled the challenges of traffic prediction by introducing ResCAL, a residual estimation module that enhances existing models by capturing autocorrelated errors.\n\nIn the realm of machine translation, I have pioneered personalized automatic post-editing frameworks that adapt translations to individual user preferences, and I have investigated domain adaptation strategies to optimize neural machine translation models. My research extends to understanding crowd movement patterns in urban environments, where I developed the PASTA model to predict city-wide crowd flows.\n\nI am passionate about bridging the gap between deep learning models and real-world applications, as demonstrated by my work on visual analytics systems like AttnAnalyzer, which helps users interpret model behaviors in traffic forecasting. Additionally, I have contributed to the development of HyperCLOVA X, a family of large language models tailored to the Korean language, showcasing my commitment to enhancing multilingual capabilities in AI.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to address complex challenges in NLP and machine learning, ultimately contributing to more effective and user-centered technologies.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the study of intercellular signaling, foraging behavior in eusocial species, and the mathematical modeling of complex biological systems. My recent work has focused on understanding the energy efficiency of different signaling mechanisms, revealing how direct transport can outperform diffusion under certain conditions. This insight has implications for long-range cellular communication and the optimization of signaling pathways.\n\nIn addition to signaling, I have developed models to analyze the dynamics of group foraging, demonstrating how communication strategies can lead to inefficiencies in finite populations. This work bridges the gap between biological behavior and mathematical theory, particularly in the context of multi-agent systems.\n\nMy research also extends to Turing pattern formation in reaction-diffusion-advection systems, where I explore how stochastic dynamics can influence synaptogenesis in organisms like *C. elegans*. By applying advanced mathematical techniques, I have shown how noise can enhance the emergence of spontaneous patterns, contributing to our understanding of developmental processes.\n\nFurthermore, I have investigated cover times in search processes, providing new insights into how multiple searchers can efficiently explore spatial regions. My findings challenge existing assumptions in the literature and offer a universal formula for cover times that is applicable across various contexts.\n\nOverall, my work integrates theoretical modeling with biological applications, aiming to uncover the underlying principles that govern complex systems in nature. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of these phenomena and contributing to interdisciplinary research that bridges biology, mathematics, and computational science.",
