    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing network security through the application of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realm of autonomous agents and reinforcement learning. My work addresses the inherent challenges faced by defenders in the cybersecurity landscape, where attackers only need to succeed once while defenders must thwart every attempt. I have developed novel reinforcement learning agents capable of effectively defending against sophisticated attacks, including those from advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\nIn my recent projects, I have introduced an end-to-end methodology for studying attack strategies and designing defense agents, achieving significant performance improvements over previous approaches. I also explore the implications of generative large language models (LLMs) in terms of accountability and copyright issues, proposing methods to trace the origins of fine-tuned models back to their pre-trained bases.\n\nAdditionally, I have investigated the resilience of communication networks in disaster relief scenarios, particularly when faced with compromised drones. By leveraging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, I have developed strategies that maximize communication bandwidth despite ongoing adversarial interference. My research emphasizes the importance of information-rich observations, expert-guided learning, and reward optimization to enhance the performance of learning-based agents.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in machine learning and practical applications in network defense, ultimately contributing to more robust and autonomous cybersecurity solutions.",
