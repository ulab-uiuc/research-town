    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected vehicle (CV) technologies, with a strong focus on safety, efficiency, and social responsibility. My work encompasses a wide range of topics, from developing robust platooning strategies that enhance operational efficiency to addressing the vulnerabilities of AV perception systems against adversarial attacks. \n\nIn my recent studies, I have explored the integration of quantum computing with deep learning to improve traffic sign classification systems, demonstrating the potential of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks for enhanced performance and reduced memory requirements. Additionally, I have developed innovative defense mechanisms, such as the attack-resilient GAN (AR-GAN), which effectively mitigates adversarial threats while maintaining high classification accuracy.\n\nI am also passionate about the practical applications of cloud computing in CV environments. My research on serverless architectures has shown how commercial cloud services can support real-time traffic management applications, significantly improving traffic flow and reducing collision risks. Furthermore, I advocate for the ethical development of AV technologies, emphasizing the importance of fairness and transparency to prevent biases that could exacerbate social inequalities.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to contribute to the responsible evolution of transportation systems, ensuring that emerging technologies serve all members of society while addressing pressing environmental challenges, such as methane emissions detection using advanced machine learning models. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications, fostering a safer and more efficient future for transportation.",

My recent work has explored a variety of models, including the triangular lattice and the Hubbard model, to understand complex phenomena such as phase transitions, charge density waves, and superconductivity. I employ advanced computational techniques, including determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, to investigate the effects of electron-phonon interactions and their implications for materials like cuprates and Kitaev candidates.\n\nOne of my significant contributions is the exploration of the thermal Hall effect in Kitaev-Heisenberg systems, where I demonstrated how spin-phonon interactions can influence magnetic states and thermal conductivity. Additionally, I have developed methods to enhance Monte Carlo simulations using neural networks, achieving substantial speedups in computational efficiency.\n\nMy research also delves into the emerging field of quantum machine learning, where I investigate the expressibility of quantum circuits within convolutional neural networks. This work not only advances our understanding of quantum-enhanced models but also provides insights into classical machine learning techniques.\n\nOverall, my goal is to bridge theoretical insights with experimental observations, providing a deeper understanding of the rich physics underlying quantum materials and their potential applications in future technologies.",
