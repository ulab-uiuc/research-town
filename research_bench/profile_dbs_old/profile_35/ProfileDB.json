    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.\n\nI also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This innovation has led to substantial accuracy gains across multiple prediction benchmarks. Recognizing the challenges posed by dynamic graphs, I proposed the ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments, enhancing scalability and real-world applicability.\n\nIn addition to architectural advancements, I have explored the intricate relationship between neural network structures and their predictive performance through relational graphs. My work aims to systematically study the design space of GNNs, providing guidelines for optimizing architectures across various tasks. I am also passionate about improving the efficiency of automated machine learning (AutoML) methods, as demonstrated by my development of FALCON and AutoTransfer, which leverage design graphs to streamline the search for optimal model architectures.\n\nOverall, my research is driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve, making them more effective and accessible for a wide range of applications.",
