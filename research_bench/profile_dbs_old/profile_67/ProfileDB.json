    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to the intersection of machine learning and data privacy, with a particular focus on Federated Learning (FL) and its applications in real-world scenarios. My recent work has centered around Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), where I explore innovative ways to enable collaborative model training across organizations while preserving the confidentiality of their data. \n\nOne of my significant contributions is the development of Stalactite, an open-source framework designed to simplify the implementation of VFL systems. This framework empowers researchers to concentrate on algorithmic advancements rather than the complexities of engineering, facilitating the deployment of learning in distributed environments. Stalactite not only incorporates various VFL algorithms but also integrates a robust homomorphic encryption layer, ensuring data security during the learning process.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge the gap between data privacy regulations and the need for effective machine learning solutions, particularly in recommendation systems where data is often siloed across different organizations. I am passionate about advancing the field of FL and enabling collaborative intelligence while maintaining the highest standards of data protection.",

    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.\n\nI am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a \"sweet spot\" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities.\n\nIn addition to static graphs, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML), where I introduced FALCON and AutoTransfer to streamline the search for optimal model designs across various tasks, significantly reducing computational costs.\n\nOverall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, providing scalable solutions that advance the state of the art in graph-based learning. I am passionate about exploring new frontiers in this rapidly evolving field and contributing to the development of more robust and efficient machine learning models.",
