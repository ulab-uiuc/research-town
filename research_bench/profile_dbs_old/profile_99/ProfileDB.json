    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of machine learning through innovative approaches grounded in information theory and causal inference. My recent work explores the application of mutual information to enhance algorithm design, enabling more efficient and generalizable learning systems. I have developed frameworks that improve classification and regression tasks, particularly in the context of cross-dataset transfer.\n\nI am particularly interested in addressing challenges related to out-of-distribution data and spurious correlations in causal models. My research introduces novel metrics, such as Dataset Reconstruction Accuracy, to evaluate model effectiveness and proposes intervention strategies to refine causal models in reinforcement learning environments. Additionally, I have investigated the ethical implications of recommender systems, advocating for values engineering that incorporates stakeholder perspectives.\n\nMy work also delves into the calibration of machine learning classifiers, where I have conducted comprehensive studies to improve the measurement of overconfidence and underconfidence in predictions. I aim to enhance the reliability of machine learning models, especially in critical domains like medicine, where understanding model uncertainty is paramount. By leveraging Bayesian methods and RNN ensembles, I strive to provide insights that can lead to better decision-making in healthcare.\n\nOverall, my research is driven by a commitment to creating robust, interpretable, and ethically aligned machine learning systems that can adapt to complex real-world challenges.",
