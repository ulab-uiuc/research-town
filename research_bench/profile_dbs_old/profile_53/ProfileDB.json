    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to addressing critical challenges in healthcare and autonomous systems through innovative modeling and machine learning techniques. My recent work focuses on the alarming rise in diabetes cases, particularly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. I developed a predictive model that quantifies factors influencing hospital stay durations for diabetes patients, providing valuable insights for hospital administrators to enhance patient management strategies. This research underscores the importance of understanding urban-rural disparities in healthcare access and the financial implications of diabetes-related hospitalizations.\n\nIn the realm of autonomous driving, I have contributed to advancing lane-changing decision-making through my novel framework, DRNet, which leverages deep reinforcement learning. This approach not only improves lane-changing efficiency but also incorporates safety verification to ensure that the agent makes safe driving decisions in complex environments.\n\nAdditionally, I have explored the groundbreaking Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for time series forecasting, proposing variants that enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability. My work on Wormhole, a deep representation learning framework, further emphasizes my commitment to understanding dynamic concepts in co-evolving sequences, providing tools for better decision-making in complex systems.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, ensuring that my findings contribute to more effective healthcare management and safer autonomous systems.",
