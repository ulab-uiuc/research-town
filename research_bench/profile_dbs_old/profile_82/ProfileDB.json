    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of control systems, cyber-physical systems, and machine learning, with a particular focus on compositional approaches and security properties. My recent work has centered on developing opacity-preserving finite abstractions for networks of discrete-time nonlinear control systems, which addresses the growing security concerns in cyber-physical environments. I have introduced innovative simulation functions that maintain opacity properties while enabling the construction of interconnected symbolic models.\n\nIn addition to my work on opacity, I have explored decentralized controller synthesis for discrete-time linear control systems, emphasizing the importance of local safety controllers that can be composed to ensure overall system safety.

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of embodied AI, particularly in the realm of long-horizon planning. My recent work centers around the development of ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-world Long-horizon Embodied Planning. Unlike previous approaches that rely heavily on GPT-4V for task decomposition, which can limit the diversity of tasks due to its predefined action constraints, ReLEP leverages a fine-tuned large vision language model. This model enables agents to formulate plans as sequences of skill functions tailored to specific instructions and scene images, drawn from a meticulously curated skill library.\n\nA key innovation in ReLEP is its Memory module, which allows for effective plan and status recall, alongside a Robot Configuration module that enhances versatility across different robot types. To address the challenge of dataset scarcity, I also introduced a semi-automatic data generation pipeline, ensuring that our framework is robust and adaptable. Through extensive offline experiments across eight daily embodied tasks, ReLEP has demonstrated its capability to accomplish complex long-horizon tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods. My work aims to push the boundaries of what embodied agents can achieve in real-world scenarios, paving the way for more intelligent and versatile AI systems.",
