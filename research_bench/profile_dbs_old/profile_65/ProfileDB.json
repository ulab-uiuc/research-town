    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to addressing the challenges of data scarcity and privacy in the realm of industrial surface defect classification (SDC) and fault diagnosis (FD) through innovative applications of federated learning (FL). My recent work has focused on developing personalized federated learning approaches, such as Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning (AFedCL), which effectively tackle data heterogeneity among clients. By employing dynamic consensus construction and a consensus-aware aggregation mechanism, I enhance the global model's generalization capabilities while ensuring that local models retain their unique insights.\n\nAdditionally, I have introduced the representation encoding-based federated meta-learning (REFML) framework, which leverages the inherent heterogeneity of training clients to improve out-of-distribution generalization. This framework not only addresses the domain discrepancies that often plague FL but also optimizes the use of limited training data across different equipment types. My research has consistently demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, achieving up to 18.33% better performance on unseen equipment types compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and real-world industrial applications, ensuring that privacy concerns do not hinder the development of robust and effective models. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of federated learning to create solutions that are both innovative and practical for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).",
