    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the interpretability and performance of machine learning models, particularly in the context of high-dimensional, low-sample-size (HDLSS) tabular data. My recent work has focused on various innovative approaches, such as adversarial training to improve the interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for skin cancer diagnosis, where I demonstrated that adversarially trained models yield sharper and more coherent saliency maps.\n\nI have also explored the limitations of concept bottleneck models and proposed the Weight Predictor Network with Feature Selection (WPFS) to tackle the challenges of high-dimensional biomedical data. This model not only reduces the number of learnable parameters but also performs effective feature selection, significantly outperforming standard methods across multiple datasets.\n\nMy research extends to GCondNet, a framework that leverages implicit structures in tabular data to enhance neural network performance, and TabMDA, a manifold data augmentation method that utilizes pre-trained models to improve classifier performance on tabular datasets. Additionally, I developed ProtoGate, a prototype-based model for feature selection that balances global and local feature selection, ensuring consistent predictions with underlying data clusters.\n\nI am particularly passionate about addressing the challenges posed by small datasets in critical fields, leading to my work on TabEBM, a class-conditional generative method using Energy-Based Models. This approach generates high-quality synthetic data that enhances classification performance, especially in scenarios where data is scarce. Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between complex machine learning techniques and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.",
