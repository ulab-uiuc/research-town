    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of tabular and graph machine learning, with a focus on enhancing predictive performance through the integration of graph-based methods. My work addresses the unique challenges posed by heterogeneous tabular data, where I have developed a benchmark that evaluates various models, including graph neural networks (GNNs) and traditional tabular models. Through empirical studies, I have demonstrated that GNNs can significantly improve predictive outcomes, while also revealing that with appropriate feature preprocessing, standard tabular models can compete effectively.\n\nIn addition to this, I am deeply invested in the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graph classification. My research emphasizes the importance of uncertainty estimation and highlights the lack of a universal solution for OOD detection, advocating for a nuanced approach that considers both graph representations and predictive distributions.\n\nFurthermore, I have proposed a novel methodology for inducing diverse distributional shifts based on graph structure, which allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of graph models under challenging conditions. My findings indicate that simple models can often outperform more complex ones in these scenarios, revealing a critical trade-off between representation quality and the ability to distinguish between different distributions.\n\nOverall, my research aims to bridge the gap between tabular and graph machine learning, providing insights and methodologies that enhance the robustness and reliability of machine learning systems in real-world applications.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intricacies of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their application to both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. My recent work has focused on addressing the challenges posed by heterophily in graph structures, where I have critically examined existing homophily measures and proposed the adjusted homophily metric, which offers a more reliable comparison across datasets. Additionally, I introduced the concept of label informativeness (LI), which provides deeper insights into how neighbor labels influence node predictions, demonstrating its correlation with GNN performance.\n\nRecognizing the gap between tabular and graph machine learning, I have developed a benchmark that integrates heterogeneous tabular node features into graph models. This work highlights the potential of GNNs to enhance predictive performance in tabular contexts while also revealing that traditional tabular models can be adapted to leverage graph data effectively.\n\nChallenging the prevailing notion that GNNs are limited to homophilous graphs, I have shown that standard GNN architectures can perform robustly on heterophilous datasets, even outperforming specialized models. My research aims to bridge the divide between theoretical advancements and practical applications, providing valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the fields of graph and tabular machine learning.",
