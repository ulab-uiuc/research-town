    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and robustness of deep neural networks, particularly in resource-constrained environments. My work addresses the critical challenges of model size and deployment, especially in safety-critical applications. I introduced Deadwooding, a global pruning technique that leverages a Lagrangian Dual method to achieve model sparsity without sacrificing accuracy or adversarial robustness. This innovation has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in model performance.\n\nIn my pursuit of practical solutions, I developed VeriCompress, an automated tool that optimizes the search and training of compressed models with guaranteed robustness. This tool not only accelerates training but also ensures that the resulting models are suitable for deployment on edge devices, requiring significantly less memory and inference time compared to existing methods. My comprehensive evaluations across various datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR, demonstrate VeriCompress's effectiveness in identifying robust models tailored for safety-critical applications.\n\nAdditionally, I have explored the realm of human sensing applications, where I introduced CRoP, a static personalization approach that optimizes model performance by addressing intra-user heterogeneity. This work is particularly relevant in clinical settings, where data limitations pose significant challenges. By combining pre-trained models with pruning techniques, CRoP enhances personalization and generalization, showcasing its potential impact on real-world health applications.
