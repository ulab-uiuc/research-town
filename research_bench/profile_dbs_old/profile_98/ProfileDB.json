    "bio": "I am a researcher with a strong focus on the intersection of mathematics and machine learning, particularly in the context of graph theory and healthcare analytics. My recent work has delved into the intersection distribution of polynomial functions over finite fields, where I successfully resolved conjectures related to power functions and their intersection properties with lines in the affine plane. This research not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of polynomial intersections but also employs advanced techniques such as the multivariate method and QM-equivalence.\n\nIn addition to my theoretical pursuits, I am passionate about applying machine learning to real-world problems, particularly in healthcare. I have analyzed extensive administrative claims data to predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). By leveraging both traditional machine learning methods like Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as deep learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, I have developed robust prediction models. My findings highlight the effectiveness of LSTM, especially with a 24-month observation window, in outperforming existing models. I also emphasize the importance of model interpretability through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provides valuable insights into the factors influencing patient outcomes. Overall, my work bridges theoretical mathematics and practical applications, aiming to make a meaningful impact in both fields.",

    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and machine learning, my work is driven by a passion for understanding and enhancing the capabilities of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the spatial relationships of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction and community detection.\n\nI also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities during the aggregation process. This advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction tasks. My research extends to dynamic graphs, where I proposed the ROLAND framework, enabling static GNNs to adapt effectively to evolving data structures.\n\nIn addition to architectural innovations, I have explored the design space of GNNs, creating a systematic approach to identify optimal architectures for specific tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the search for effective neural architectures by leveraging prior knowledge and task similarities.\n\nOverall, my research is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of GNNs, making them more robust, efficient, and applicable to real-world challenges. I am excited about the future of this field and the potential for my contributions to drive further advancements.",
