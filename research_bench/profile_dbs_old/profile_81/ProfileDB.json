    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of agents in understanding and executing complex written instructions through advanced reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. My recent work has focused on language reward shaping (LRS), where I critically examined its effectiveness and identified inherent brittleness in existing methods. I demonstrated that agents trained with LRS rewards often converge more slowly than those using pure RL, highlighting the need for more robust designs.\n\nIn my exploration of large language models (LLMs), I developed a novel approach that constructs an action schema library to generate diverse interpretations of natural language descriptions. This method, combined with a semantic validation and ranking module, allows for fully automated planning without expert intervention, significantly improving scalability and accessibility in AI planning.\n\nAdditionally, I have investigated the vulnerabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) as reward signals in sparse environments. My research revealed that noise in reward signals can severely hinder agent performance, leading to the introduction of BiMI (Binary Mutual Information), a noise-resilient reward function. This innovation has shown remarkable improvements in agent performance, making VLM-based reward models more practical for real-world applications.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to bridge the gap between natural language understanding and effective agent behavior, paving the way for more intuitive and capable AI systems.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of planning and decision-making in artificial intelligence. My work primarily focuses on width-based algorithms, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in classical planning and have been successfully adapted to both model-based and model-free settings. I have explored various innovative techniques, such as classical count-based novelty and regression-based supervised learning, to enhance exploration and learning efficiency in planning tasks.\n\nMy recent contributions include developing novel algorithms that leverage action novelty rank for generalized planning and creating a robust framework for goal recognition that aligns more closely with human inference. I have also investigated the integration of language reward shaping in reinforcement learning, revealing critical vulnerabilities and proposing noise-resilient reward functions to improve agent performance.\n\nIn multi-agent planning, I have addressed privacy concerns by employing best-first width search techniques, demonstrating their effectiveness in decentralized settings. My research extends to epistemic planning, where I have introduced functional STRIPS to enhance scalability and expressiveness.\n\nAdditionally, I have developed Planimation, an open-source framework for visualizing planning solutions, and explored the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search for generating diverse and high-quality plans in complex environments. My work on transhumeral prostheses highlights the application of goal recognition systems using time series data, showcasing the potential for improving assistive technologies.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications, contributing to the development of intelligent systems that can effectively navigate complex decision-making scenarios.",
