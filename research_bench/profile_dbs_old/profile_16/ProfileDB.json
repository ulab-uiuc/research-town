    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intricate relationships between statistical modeling, network analysis, and machine learning. My work primarily focuses on nonparametric regression models, where I have developed methodologies for variable screening that leverage the negligible impact of irrelevant variables on regression functions. This research has practical applications across various fields, including economics and finance.\n\nIn addition to regression analysis, I delve into the realm of random graphs, particularly latent position random graph models. My recent work involves predicting response variables on out-of-sample nodes using manifold learning and graph embedding techniques, with a strong emphasis on theoretical convergence guarantees. This approach has been validated through simulations and applications to biological data, such as Drosophila brain studies.\n\nI am also interested in generative models, where I investigate the differences in model behavior through embedding-based representations. My research aims to establish consistent estimation techniques as the landscape of generative models evolves.\n\nFurthermore, I have developed algorithms for predicting responses in networks that share common nodes, utilizing a manifold learning framework to capture the underlying structure of these networks. My work is grounded in rigorous theoretical justifications and is supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating its applicability to complex datasets like the larval Drosophila connectome.\n\nOverall, my research is driven by a passion for uncovering the statistical properties of complex systems and developing innovative methodologies that bridge theory and application.",
