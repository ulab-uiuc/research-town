    "bio": "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the field of generative models, particularly focusing on enhancing the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models for image generation. My recent work has led to the development of innovative architectures like DeshuffleGAN, which employs a self-supervised deshuffling task to improve the learning of spatial structures in images, resulting in more realistic outputs. I have also tackled the issue of codebook collapse in discrete variational autoencoders (dVAEs) by introducing evidential deep learning (EdVAE), which enhances reconstruction performance and codebook utilization.\n\nMy exploration of disentangled representation learning culminated in the FactorQVAE model, which combines discrete representation learning with optimization-based disentanglement, outperforming previous methods on key metrics. Additionally, I have investigated the generalizability of self-supervised tasks across different GAN architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of deshuffling in improving image generation quality.\n\nMore recently, I have shifted my focus to diffusion models, where I introduced ProtoDiffusion, a method that leverages learned class prototypes to accelerate training while maintaining high generation quality. My work also extends to text-guided image generation, where I fine-tuned a diffusion model specifically for textile pattern generation, showcasing its potential to revolutionize design processes in the textile industry.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to push the boundaries of generative modeling, contributing to both theoretical advancements and practical applications in computer vision.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems, with a particular focus on uncertainty quantification and representation learning. My recent work has explored the development of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (N-ODEs) and their Bayesian counterparts, which allow for robust prediction uncertainty quantification while maintaining the expressive power of deterministic models. I have also contributed to the field of probabilistic deep state-space models, where I leverage neural networks to model complex dynamical systems with unknown parametric forms.\n\nMy research extends to innovative methods for closed-form predictive distribution modeling, where I integrate evidential deep learning to enhance uncertainty quantification capabilities. I have developed techniques for efficient moment matching in Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDEs) and proposed novel algorithms for bandit problems, combining Bayesian and frequentist principles to improve decision-making in non-stationary environments.\n\nAdditionally, I am passionate about disentangled representation learning and have introduced models that facilitate the independent representation of generative factors. My work emphasizes the importance of interpretability in machine learning, as I strive to bridge the gap between black-box models and human-understandable dynamics through symbolic regression.\n\nOverall, my research aims to advance the understanding and application of machine learning in dynamic environments, ensuring that models not only perform well but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates and insights into the underlying processes they represent.",
