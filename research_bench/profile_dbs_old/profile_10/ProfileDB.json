    "bio": "I am a researcher passionate about the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, with a particular focus on leveraging advanced models like Transformers and large language models (LLMs) for innovative applications. My recent work includes developing novel fine-dining recipes using auto-regressive language models, showcasing the potential of AI in culinary creativity. I have also explored the challenges of multilingual mental health support, creating a comprehensive dataset that evaluates LLM performance across multiple languages, highlighting the nuances that can affect model accuracy.\n\nIn addition to my work in NLP, I have contributed to the field of graph learning, addressing the limitations of deep graph neural networks (GNNs) through my research on over-smoothing and over-squashing. My proposed Stochastic Jost and Liu Curvature Rewiring (SJLR) algorithm offers a computationally efficient solution to enhance representation learning in GNNs. I am also dedicated to improving text classification through innovative regularization techniques, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, which balances sparsity and accuracy.\n\nMy research is driven by a commitment to advancing machine learning methodologies and their applications across diverse domains, from culinary arts to mental health and graph analysis. I strive to create tools and frameworks that not only push the boundaries of current technologies but also provide practical solutions to real-world challenges.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of graph theory and machine learning, with a particular focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph kernels. Over the years, I have contributed to the development of novel algorithms and frameworks that enhance the understanding and application of structured data. My work spans a wide range of topics, from proposing new graph kernels that leverage message passing to creating libraries like GraKeL, which unifies various graph kernels for practical use in machine learning pipelines.\n\nRecently, I have explored the limitations of standard GNNs and developed more expressive architectures, such as k-hop GNNs and Path Neural Networks, which can capture fundamental graph properties and distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs. My research also extends to dynamic graphs, where I have proposed models that predict graph evolution over time, demonstrating the effectiveness of GNNs in real-world applications, including epidemiological predictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to my theoretical contributions, I have focused on practical implementations, such as the Message Passing Attention network for document understanding and the time-parameterized convolutional neural network for irregularly sampled time series. My goal is to bridge the gap between theory and application, providing robust solutions that can be readily utilized in various domains, from social networks to bioinformatics. I am passionate about advancing the field of graph learning and continuously seek to uncover new insights that can drive innovation in machine learning.",
