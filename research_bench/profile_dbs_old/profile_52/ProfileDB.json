    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of graph theory and molecular design, with a particular focus on deep generative models for drug discovery. My work encompasses a range of innovative approaches, from the Sombor index of quasi-tree graphs to the development of novel frameworks like Ligand Neural Network (L-Net) and DeepLigBuilder+. \n\nThrough L-Net, I have pioneered a method for generating drug-like molecules with high-quality 3D structures, directly addressing the limitations of existing models. My research emphasizes the importance of fine-grained molecular representations, leading to the creation of FineMolTex, which integrates motif-level insights into molecular graph learning. This framework has shown remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, significantly enhancing our understanding of molecular properties.\n\nI have also explored the potential of sequential graph generators for de novo molecular design, demonstrating their efficiency in generating larger molecules while maintaining high validity rates. My work on DeepLigBuilder+ further bridges the gap between structure-based design and synthetic feasibility, providing a comprehensive solution for drug discovery.\n\nRecently, I have delved into the relationship between graph neural networks (GNNs) and diffusion processes, proposing a general diffusion framework that unifies various GNN architectures. This exploration has led to the development of HiD-Net, a robust graph diffusion network that enhances performance across diverse graph structures.\n\nOverall, my research aims to push the boundaries of molecular design and graph theory, contributing to more efficient and effective drug discovery processes.",
