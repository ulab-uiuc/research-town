    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, with a particular focus on privacy-preserving technologies and decision support systems. My recent work has centered on developing frameworks that ensure patient data privacy while enabling effective clinical decision-making. For instance, I pioneered a local differential privacy approach for learning population rulesets in clinical decision support systems, utilizing Monte-Carlo Tree Search to balance privacy and utility.\n\nI have also explored safety assurance in machine learning for medical cyber-physical systems, specifically in artificial pancreas systems, where I implemented deep learning models and formal verification techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. My research on hemodynamic risk stratification led to the creation of CARNA, a framework that integrates invasive hemodynamics and interpretable machine learning to improve heart failure risk assessments.\n\nAdditionally, I have investigated Type I Diabetes management through a Signal Temporal Logic-based learning approach, identifying behavioral patterns that influence glycemic control. My work on causal discovery in time series data culminated in the development of MotifDisco, a framework that uncovers causal relationships among motifs in glucose traces, enhancing our understanding of patient behaviors.\n\nMost recently, I introduced GlucoSynth, a privacy-preserving GAN framework for generating synthetic glucose traces, which maintains the integrity of the data while ensuring strong privacy guarantees. My research aims to empower healthcare providers with robust, interpretable tools that enhance patient care while safeguarding sensitive information.",
