    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing our understanding of complex and nonlinear dynamical systems through innovative machine-learning techniques. My work primarily focuses on developing model-free, data-driven frameworks that enable accurate tracking of time-varying parameters from partial state observations. I have explored the potential of reservoir computing and random forests to enhance parameter tracking and weak signal detection, particularly in challenging environments like magnetic navigation.\n\nOne of my significant contributions is a general model-discovery framework that overcomes the limitations of sparse optimization, allowing for the analysis of dynamical systems that do not adhere to sparsity conditions. This framework has revealed the non-uniqueness of models that can accurately represent system dynamics, which has profound implications for understanding chaotic systems.\n\nIn the realm of control engineering, I have developed a machine-learning framework for nonlinear tracking control of robotic manipulators, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time applications with partially observed states. My recent research also addresses critical environmental issues, such as predicting tipping points in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, where I apply machine-learning methods to forecast potential system collapses due to climate change.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical dynamical systems and practical applications, contributing to fields ranging from robotics to climate science. My research not only enhances our predictive capabilities but also provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems.",
