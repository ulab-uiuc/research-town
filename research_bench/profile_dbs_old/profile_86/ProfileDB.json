My recent work focuses on tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) and their interaction with external tools. I developed the MGToolBench dataset to bridge the gap between overly detailed training instructions and the more natural, user-centric instructions found in practice. This led to the creation of ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework that significantly improves task completion and instruction-following capabilities.\n\nIn addition, I have explored the potential of vision-language models (VLMs) in mobile AI agents. I recognized the limitations of existing VLMs, which often lack the ability to understand specific UI elements and inter-UI relationships. To address this, I introduced MobileVLM, which incorporates additional pre-training stages and a large dataset, Mobile3M, to enhance the model's understanding of mobile interfaces.\n\nFurthermore, I have developed TextFlint, a multilingual robustness evaluation platform for NLP tasks. This tool allows for comprehensive analysis of model robustness through various methodologies, ensuring that models are evaluated not just on performance but also on their resilience to different challenges.
