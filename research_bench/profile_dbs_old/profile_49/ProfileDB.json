    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing data estimation techniques in sensor-less environments, particularly in the realms of traffic state estimation and environmental monitoring. My recent work centers around the development of Kriformer, a novel graph transformer model designed to tackle the challenges posed by sparse sensor deployment and unreliable data. By framing the estimation problem as a spatiotemporal kriging task, I leverage the power of transformer architecture to effectively capture spatial and temporal correlations, even when resources are limited.\n\nIn Kriformer, I have integrated a carefully constructed positional encoding module that embeds spatiotemporal features, alongside a sophisticated spatiotemporal attention mechanism that significantly boosts estimation accuracy. My approach includes a multi-head spatial interaction attention module, which adeptly captures subtle spatial relationships between observed and unobserved locations. I also employ a random masking strategy during training, enabling the model to learn from partial information loss and enhancing its ability to discern correlations among various locations.\n\nThe experimental results from my work demonstrate Kriformer's exceptional performance in representation learning for unobserved locations, validated on real-world traffic speed datasets. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of how we understand and estimate data in complex systems, and I look forward to further exploring innovative solutions in this field.",
