    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.\n\nI am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a \"sweet spot\" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities.\n\nAdditionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML), where I introduced FALCON and AutoTransfer to streamline the search for optimal model designs across various tasks, significantly reducing computational costs.\n\nOverall, my goal is to push the boundaries of GNN research, providing scalable solutions and insights that can be applied across a wide range of domains, from social networks to biological systems. I am passionate about fostering a deeper understanding of how graph-based approaches can transform machine learning and contribute to solving complex real-world problems.",
