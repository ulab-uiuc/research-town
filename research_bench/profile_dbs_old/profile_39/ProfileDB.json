    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to the intersection of machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, particularly in the context of battery management systems. My recent work focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries, which is crucial for optimizing their performance and ensuring timely recharging. I have developed various machine learning models, including CatBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), achieving over 99% accuracy in classifying RUL into distinct categories.\n\nIn my research, I have integrated these models with IoT systems to automate battery charging and fault management. Utilizing the Blynk IoT platform, I have created a user-friendly interface that allows for real-time monitoring and control of battery parameters. My work not only demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing battery management but also showcases innovative automation techniques that contribute to energy efficiency. By leveraging a combination of machine learning and IoT, I aim to push the boundaries of smart energy solutions and improve the sustainability of battery-operated systems.",
