    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and deep learning applications. My recent work includes the development of the Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) model, which effectively addresses the challenges of imbalanced regression while providing robust uncertainty estimations. I have also pioneered methods for domain adaptation in contextual bandits, enabling effective learning across different domains despite distribution shifts.\n\nMy research extends to the integration of geometry in neural networks, where I introduced recurrent geometry-aware networks that enhance object detection and segmentation by leveraging 3D latent features. Additionally, I have explored latent graph inference techniques to refine graph structures in GNNs, improving their robustness and performance.\n\nIn the realm of reinforcement learning, I have developed a realistic translation network that bridges the gap between virtual training environments and real-world applications, particularly in autonomous driving. My work on Safe Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) introduces natural language constraints, making the technology more accessible and adaptable.\n\nI am also passionate about applying my expertise to medical imaging, as demonstrated by my investigation into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for CEST MRI data analysis, where I showcased its superiority over traditional methods. Overall, my research aims to push the boundaries of machine learning methodologies while addressing real-world challenges across various domains.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the robustness and performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through innovative approaches to graph structure learning. My recent work addresses a critical challenge in GNNs: the amplification of noise during the message-passing process, which often arises from relying solely on observed adjacency matrices. To tackle this issue, I have developed a novel Boolean product-based graph residual connection that effectively links latent graphs with their original counterparts. This method not only corrects the learning process by computing the Boolean product between adjacency matrices at each layer but also facilitates the discovery of triangular cliques within the graph structure.\n\nMy research emphasizes the importance of mitigating fluctuations in latent graph learning, and I have validated my approach using benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both performance and robustness. I am passionate about exploring the intricate relationships within graph data and continuously seek to push the boundaries of GNN capabilities, contributing to the broader field of machine learning and its applications.",
