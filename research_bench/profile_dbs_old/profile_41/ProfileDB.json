    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing societal issues through advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of hate speech detection, wildlife trafficking, and human activity recognition. My recent work focuses on developing robust frameworks that not only enhance detection accuracy but also ensure fairness and resilience against adversarial attacks. For instance, I designed a novel hate speech detection framework that leverages Bidirectional Quaternion-Quasi-LSTM layers, achieving remarkable performance across multiple datasets while addressing model uncertainty and bias.\n\nIn addition to hate speech detection, I have tackled the challenge of identifying wildlife trafficking behaviors in online platforms. By creating a scalable dataset and employing a human-in-the-loop approach, I developed a practical framework that effectively identifies suspicious posts, contributing to the fight against illegal wildlife trade.\n\nMy research also delves into the complexities of human activity recognition, where I introduced the Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning framework. This innovative approach captures the nuances of context-aware data, significantly outperforming existing models.\n\nI am passionate about making my work accessible to the research community, sharing code and datasets to foster collaboration and further exploration. My goal is to leverage machine learning to create impactful solutions that address real-world challenges, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing challenges in the realms of misinformation, communication networks, and machine learning. My recent work has focused on combating the spread of fake news, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I developed the MM-COVID dataset to facilitate multilingual fake news detection. This dataset, comprising over 10,000 pieces of content in multiple languages, serves as a vital resource for understanding and mitigating the impact of misinformation.\n\nIn addition to my work on fake news, I have explored the potential of advanced text generation methods, creating FactGen to generate high-quality news content while ensuring consistency and factual accuracy. My research also extends to the telecommunications sector, where I have critically evaluated analogue radio over fiber (A-RoF) techniques for next-generation radio access networks, proposing innovative architectures to enhance connectivity for high-speed trains.\n\nI am particularly interested in the intersection of self-supervised learning and graph neural networks, exemplified by my development of GRENADE, a model that effectively captures both textual semantics and structural context in text-attributed graphs. Furthermore, I have contributed to federated learning protocols, introducing FedADMM to improve communication efficiency and adaptability in heterogeneous environments.\n\nMy work is driven by a commitment to advancing technology for societal benefit, and I strive to create solutions that enhance data quality, improve model performance, and ultimately contribute to a more informed and connected world.",
