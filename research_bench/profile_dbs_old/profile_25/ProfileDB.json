    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to unraveling the complexities of molecular clouds, particularly focusing on their morphology and evolution. My recent work involves analyzing filamentary molecular clouds using data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. By examining a significant area of the Milky Way, I have investigated the orientation and morphological asymmetry of these filaments, employing elliptical fitting techniques to achieve precise measurements.\n\nOne of my key findings is the bimodal distribution of filament orientations relative to the Galactic plane, revealing intriguing patterns that deepen our understanding of their formation processes. Despite exploring various parameters, I found no significant correlations with orientation, which raises further questions about the underlying mechanisms at play. Notably, my research highlights that over 40% of the filaments exhibit head-tail asymmetry, indicating a tendency for mass concentration at one end, a phenomenon that could have implications for star formation and cloud dynamics.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to contribute to the broader understanding of molecular clouds and their role in the Galactic ecosystem, paving the way for future studies in astrophysics.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing societal issues through advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of hate speech detection, wildlife trafficking, and human activity recognition. My recent work focuses on developing robust frameworks that not only enhance the accuracy of hate speech classification but also ensure fairness and resilience against adversarial attacks. For instance, I designed a novel hate speech detection framework, SWE2, which leverages both word-level semantics and sub-word knowledge, achieving impressive performance metrics even under extreme adversarial conditions.\n\nIn addition to hate speech detection, I have tackled the challenge of wildlife trafficking by creating a scalable dataset and a practical framework for identifying suspicious online behaviors related to wildlife product sales. This work is crucial in combating illegal activities that threaten biodiversity.\n\nMy research also delves into the complexities of human activity recognition, where I developed the Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning (DHC-HGL) framework. This innovative approach captures the nuances of context-aware data, significantly outperforming existing models.\n\nI am passionate about making my research accessible and reproducible, sharing code and datasets to foster collaboration and further exploration in these critical areas. My goal is to leverage machine learning to create impactful solutions that contribute to a safer and more equitable society.",

My recent work includes the development of CovidRhythm, a novel Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network that utilizes physiological and rhythmic features from consumer-grade wearables to detect Covid-19 even before symptoms manifest. This innovative approach achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.79, demonstrating the potential of biobehavioral rhythms in timely disease detection.\n\nIn addition to my work on Covid-19 detection, I have focused on improving energy efficiency in deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech processing. By integrating a masking kernel into the training process, I successfully minimized energy consumption during both data acquisition and inference by 57%, making strides in sustainable AI applications.\n\nMy research also extends to Human Activity Recognition (HAR), where I introduced the Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning (DHC-HGL) framework. This framework effectively captures the complexities of context-aware HAR by utilizing heterogeneous hypergraph properties, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.\n\nFurthermore, I have explored context-aware human activity recognition through a novel Heterogeneous HyperGraph Neural Network (HHGNN-CHAR), which leverages the underlying graph structure of activity data.
