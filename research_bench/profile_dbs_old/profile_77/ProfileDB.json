    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing pedestrian trajectory prediction and addressing challenges in truck parking management. My work focuses on integrating social interactions and environmental factors to improve the accuracy of trajectory predictions. One of my recent contributions is the RNTransformer, a novel model that incorporates crowd trip information to capture global social dynamics, significantly enhancing the performance of various local pedestrian trajectory prediction models. \n\nAdditionally, I have developed the Regional Temporal Graph Neural Network (RegT-GCN) to tackle the issue of insufficient truck parking spaces along freight corridors. This framework leverages spatio-temporal dependencies and historical data to predict parking usage across multiple sites, providing a comprehensive solution to improve parking management. My research aims to contribute to safer and more efficient urban environments, whether through accurate pedestrian trajectory predictions or effective truck parking strategies. I am passionate about applying advanced machine learning techniques to real-world problems, ultimately enhancing traffic safety and efficiency.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher specializing in stylized text-to-image generation, with a keen interest in bridging the gap between textual descriptions and visual representation. My recent work introduces InstaStyle, a novel approach that enables the generation of high-fidelity stylized images using just a single reference image. I discovered that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image carries essential style signals, which I harness through DDIM inversion and a diffusion model to create new images that accurately reflect the desired style.\n\nUnderstanding the challenges posed by the inherent ambiguity of textual prompts, I also developed a learnable style token that refines these prompts, enhancing the precision of style conveyance. My research not only demonstrates superior performance against existing benchmarks but also explores creative avenues such as style combination through mixed inversion noise. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of generative models and contributing to the evolving landscape of AI-driven creativity.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing intelligent transportation systems, particularly in the realm of cooperative freeway traffic control. My recent work centers around developing a deep neuroevolution model, known as ES-CTC, which integrates ramp metering, differential variable speed limits, and lane change control to optimize freeway traffic flow. By leveraging graph convolutional networks, I aim to extract meaningful spatial patterns from traffic sensor data, facilitating better communication among various control agents through a knowledge-sharing layer. \n\nMy approach addresses the challenges of delayed rewards and action asynchronism by employing evolutionary strategies to train agents under stochastic traffic conditions. The promising results from my simulations demonstrate that ES-CTC not only improves traffic management but also outperforms existing methods. I am passionate about applying advanced machine learning techniques to real-world transportation challenges, striving to contribute to more efficient and effective traffic systems.",
