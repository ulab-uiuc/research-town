    "bio": "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the fields of combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory, with a particular focus on problems related to geometric progressions, Ramsey theory, and graph invariants. My work has explored the existence of $k$-GP-free sequences, where I have contributed to understanding the conditions under which such sequences can be constructed with bounded gaps. I have also investigated quasirandomness in graphs, providing insights into the relationship between labeled copies of subgraphs and edge distributions.\n\nMy research extends to the study of rotor-router networks, where I have classified universal rotor types and introduced new classes of rotors to better understand their properties. Additionally, I have made significant strides in the area of zero-sum sequences in finite abelian groups, proving upper bounds for the smallest integers that guarantee zero-sum subsequences.\n\nI have also tackled problems in the realm of graph colorings, particularly addressing Tomescu's conjecture and its implications for connected graphs. My recent work includes developing probabilistic constructions for hypergraphs and exploring the hat-guessing number of various graph classes, contributing to a deeper understanding of these intriguing mathematical structures.\n\nOverall, my research is characterized by a blend of theoretical exploration and practical applications, aiming to uncover new relationships and bounds within combinatorial mathematics. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of these complex topics and contributing to the broader mathematical community.",
