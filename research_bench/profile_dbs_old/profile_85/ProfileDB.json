My work spans a variety of topics, including the classification of shuffle groups, the study of perfect codes in graphs, and the development of efficient algorithms for drone detection using advanced deep learning techniques.\n\nIn my recent research, I have made significant contributions to the understanding of shuffle groups, particularly proving the 2-transitivity of the shuffle group \\( G_{3,3n} \\) for multiples of 3, which leads to a complete classification of these groups. I have also explored the concept of perfect codes in finite groups, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for subgroup perfect codes and applying these results to various group classes, including projective special linear groups.\n\nAdditionally, I have investigated the application of Vision Transformers in drone detection, demonstrating their superiority over traditional CNN models in specific scenarios. My work emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying structures of both mathematical groups and machine learning models, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications.\n\nThrough my research, I strive to contribute to the broader mathematical community by providing insights and tools that facilitate further exploration in these interconnected fields.",
