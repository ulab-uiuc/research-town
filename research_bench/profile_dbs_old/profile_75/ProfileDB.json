    "bio": "As a researcher in particle physics, my work primarily focuses on enhancing our understanding of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and developing robust statistical methodologies for high-dimensional data analysis. I have generalized previous studies on constraining SMEFT operators using Drell-Yan measurements, demonstrating that while fully differential measurements provide valuable insights, single differential measurements with finer bins can be equally sensitive for specific operators. This finding emphasizes the importance of complementing fully differential analyses with targeted projections.\n\nIn addition to my work on SMEFT, I have developed a novel methodology for evaluating non-parametric two-sample tests tailored for high-dimensional generative models. My research explores various metrics, including the sliced Wasserstein distance and the sliced Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which I have shown to be computationally efficient and sensitive to data deformations. By applying these tests to diverse datasets, including particle physics data from gluon jets, I have established that one-dimensional tests can achieve sensitivity comparable to multivariate metrics while significantly reducing computational costs.\n\nOverall, my research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical statistical tools, providing a standardized framework for model comparison in high-dimensional settings, ultimately contributing to advancements in both particle physics and machine learning methodologies.",
