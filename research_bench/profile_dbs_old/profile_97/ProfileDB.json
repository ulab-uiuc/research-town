My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.\n\nI also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This innovation has led to substantial accuracy gains across multiple prediction benchmarks. Recognizing the challenges posed by dynamic graphs, I proposed the ROLAND framework, which allows static GNNs to be adapted for dynamic environments, enhancing their scalability and performance.\n\nIn addition to architectural advancements, I have explored the intricate relationship between neural network structures and their predictive performance through relational graphs. My work aims to systematically study the design space of GNNs, providing guidelines for selecting optimal architectures for specific tasks. I am also passionate about improving the efficiency of automated machine learning (AutoML) methods, as demonstrated by my development of FALCON and AutoTransfer, which leverage design graphs to streamline the search for optimal model configurations.\n\nOverall, my research is driven by a desire to push the boundaries of GNNs and contribute to a deeper understanding of their potential in various domains.",
