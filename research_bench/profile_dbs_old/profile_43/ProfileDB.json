    "bio": "I am a researcher with a keen interest in the intersection of deep learning, optimization, and game theory. My recent work has focused on developing innovative architectures for hierarchical classification tasks, exemplified by my introduction of the lexicographic hybrid deep neural network (LH-DNN). This architecture leverages concepts from lexicographic multi-objective optimization and non-standard analysis, allowing for efficient classification while significantly reducing learning parameters and computational time.\n\nIn addition to my work in deep learning, I have made strides in optimization techniques, particularly through the development of the non-Archimedean Interior Point Method (NA-IPM). This novel algorithm addresses challenges in managing infeasibility and unboundedness in optimization problems, proving to be a robust tool for a variety of linear and quadratic programming tasks.\n\nFurthermore, I have explored the dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma within game theory, extending traditional analyses to incorporate infinite and infinitesimal payoffs using Sergeyev's Infinity Computing. This work not only broadens the understanding of PD Tournaments but also provides concrete numerical insights into their outcomes.\n\nOverall, my research aims to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications, paving the way for innovative solutions in machine learning and optimization.",
