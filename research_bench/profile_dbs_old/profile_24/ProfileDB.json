    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the understanding of 3D hand-object interactions, a critical area in vision computing. My work focuses on estimating the poses of both hands and objects, addressing the complexities of their interactions, such as contact and physical plausibility. I have developed a graph-based refinement method that utilizes an interaction-aware graph-attention mechanism, enhancing the representation of hand-object relationships and significantly improving physical plausibility in pose estimation.\n\nRecognizing the limitations of existing datasets, I created HOGraspNet, a comprehensive training dataset that captures full grasp taxonomies and provides extensive annotations. This dataset includes a diverse range of hand shapes from participants of various ages, continuous video frames, and a wealth of labeled data for 3D hand and object meshes, keypoints, and contact maps. By leveraging grasp taxonomies as atomic actions, HOGraspNet enables the representation of complex hand activities, paving the way for the development of universal shape priors and foundation models for 3D hand-object interaction.\n\nMy research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, ultimately contributing to the development of more sophisticated vision systems capable of understanding and interacting with the physical world. I am excited to share my findings and resources with the community, as I believe they will inspire further exploration in this dynamic field.",

    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.\n\nI am also passionate about exploring the structural dynamics of neural networks. My work on relational graphs has unveiled critical insights into how the architecture of neural networks influences their predictive performance, leading to the identification of optimal configurations that mirror biological neural networks.\n\nIn addition to these advancements, I have introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities. This innovation has resulted in substantial accuracy gains across multiple prediction tasks.\n\nMy recent endeavors also include the ROLAND framework for dynamic graphs, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments, and the AutoTransfer method in automated machine learning (AutoML) that leverages prior architectural knowledge to improve search efficiency.\n\nOverall, my research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, driving forward the understanding and utility of GNNs in real-world scenarios. I am excited about the potential of my work to inspire future innovations in this rapidly evolving field.",
