    "bio": "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the study of information cascades and graph neural networks (GNNs). My work primarily focuses on understanding the dynamics of information diffusion in social networks, where I developed the FScaleCP framework to predict cascade dynamics in real-time, moving beyond traditional methods that only assess final cascade sizes. \n\nIn addition to cascade dynamics, I have explored the interpretability of GNNs through my novel method, GraphGI, which identifies key interactions within graphs to explain model predictions. I believe that understanding the underlying mechanisms of GNNs is crucial for their application in safety-critical scenarios, which led me to investigate their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. My research has yielded guidelines for enhancing GNN robustness and introduced the concept of model repair through GraphMU, a framework designed to fine-tune poisoned GNNs without complete retraining.\n\nMoreover, I have contributed to the field of link prediction by proposing GraphLP, a generative approach that leverages network reconstruction theory to improve link prediction accuracy. My work emphasizes the importance of understanding network structures and dynamics, aiming to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications in areas such as viral marketing and rumor prevention. Through my research, I strive to advance the capabilities of GNNs while ensuring their reliability and interpretability in real-world applications.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the interpretability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a field that has seen remarkable growth and application across various domains. My recent work focuses on addressing the black-box nature of GNNs, which often obscures the mechanisms behind their predictions. I developed a novel explanatory method called GraphGI, which identifies the coalition of nodes and edges with the highest interaction strength to create an explanatory subgraph. This approach leverages game-theoretic principles to assess how different features interact, rather than treating them in isolation.\n\nThrough GraphGI, I aim to provide clearer insights into model predictions by gradually incorporating significant edges into the subgraph, ensuring that each addition maximizes interaction strength. My method not only enhances the fidelity and sparsity of explanations but also maintains a level of interpretability that is crucial for practical applications. By employing effective approximation techniques for calculating Shapley values, I strive to make the process computationally efficient while delivering meaningful insights. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex GNN models and their users, fostering a deeper understanding of how these powerful tools make decisions.",

My recent work focuses on addressing the challenges of few-shot TAS, where I developed an efficient framework that includes a novel data augmentation method based on motion interpolation. This approach significantly increases the number of available samples by synthesizing action sequences, while my integration of a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer enhances the temporal alignment of predictions, leading to improved segmentation performance.\n\nIn addition to TAS, I am passionate about dialog summarization, particularly in real-world applications like customer service and healthcare. Recognizing the lack of suitable datasets for this task, I created an abstractive dialog summarization dataset based on MultiWOZ. To tackle the unique challenges of summarizing dialogues, I introduced the Scaffold Pointer Network (SPNet), which leverages semantic scaffolds to preserve critical entities and ensure coherence across different dialog domains. My work has demonstrated significant improvements over existing methods, as evidenced by superior performance on both automatic and human evaluation metrics.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, ultimately contributing to more effective and efficient systems in action recognition and natural language processing.",
