    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), with a particular focus on tackling real-world challenges such as data imputation, SQL generation, and the development of efficient model architectures. My recent work includes innovative methods for imputing missing values in multivariate time series data using Expectation Maximization over dynamic Bayesian networks, which significantly outperforms traditional regression-based approaches, especially for categorical variables.\n\nIn the realm of SQL generation, I developed T5QL, a method that enhances performance using smaller language models while ensuring the validity of generated SQL through context-free grammar constraints. This work addresses the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods that rely heavily on large language models (LLMs), making SQL generation more accessible and efficient.\n\nAdditionally, I have explored the evaluation of tool-augmented LLMs as conversational AI agents, creating a test generation pipeline that leverages intermediate graphs to ensure grounded and diverse test scenarios. My efforts in this area culminated in the ALMITA dataset, which provides a robust framework for assessing AI agents in customer support contexts.\n\nI am also passionate about improving low-code platforms by enabling natural language queries for database retrieval, resulting in a significant increase in user engagement and adoption rates. Lastly, I introduced the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, which merges the strengths of transformers and recurrent neural networks, achieving remarkable efficiency and performance in sequence processing tasks. My work aims to bridge the gap between computational efficiency and model performance, paving the way for more effective machine learning solutions.",
