This research could pave the way for future innovations in lensless imaging techniques, enhancing their practicality and effectiveness in real-world applications.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent nature of lensless imaging, where the raw measurements are typically blurry and lack direct focus. The reconstruction process is complicated by the convolution with a large Point Spread Function (PSF), which acts as a low-pass filter, introducing ambiguity and multiple possible recoveries for a single measurement. Traditional methods often fail to balance photorealism and consistency, leading to degraded visual quality or altered content.

This simplification has led to limitations in achieving high-quality reconstructions.

By enhancing the ability to learn disentangled representations, we can improve model interpretability and performance, leading to more robust applications in real-world scenarios. This research could pave the way for future studies to explore more complex generative factors and their interactions, ultimately contributing to the development of more sophisticated machine learning models.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in improving disentangled representation learning stem from the ill-posed nature of the problem, where there is no unique way to disentangle generative factors. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the varying representation capacities required for different generative factors, leading to either under-representation or over-representation.

By developing a framework that integrates the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM) with generative models, we can unlock new applications in areas such as data augmentation, image-to-image translation, and image editing. Moreover, this framework has the potential to revolutionize the field of computer vision by enabling more precise control over image generation, which is a crucial aspect of many real-world applications, including robotics, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles. By advancing our understanding of image generation and providing a more interpretable and controllable framework, we can pave the way for more sophisticated and reliable computer vision systems.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?\n\nDeveloping a novel image generation framework that integrates NLoTM with generative models is a challenging task due to several technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles. Firstly, NLoTM requires a hierarchical, composable discrete representation of objects and their properties, which is difficult to obtain, especially for complex scenes. Secondly, generative models, such as DeshuffleGAN and ProtoDiffusion, require large amounts of training data and computational resources to generate high-quality images. Integrating these two models while preserving their strengths is a non-trivial task. Furthermore, ensuring that the framework provides uncertainty estimates and insights into the underlying processes adds an additional layer of complexity. Naive or straightforward approaches, such as simply concatenating the two models, may fail to capture the hierarchical and composable nature of NLoTM, or may not provide the desired level of interpretability and controllability.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?\n\nDespite the significant progress made in image generation using generative models, existing solutions have limitations that prevent them from providing precise control over specific factors of variation in images. Previous research has focused on developing generative models that can generate high-quality images, but these models often lack interpretability and controllability. NLoTM has been used to learn hierarchical, composable discrete representations, but it has not been integrated with generative models to enable image generation. The main barriers that have prevented this problem from being solved until now are the technical challenges involved in integrating NLoTM with generative models, and the lack of a clear understanding of how to preserve the strengths of both models.
