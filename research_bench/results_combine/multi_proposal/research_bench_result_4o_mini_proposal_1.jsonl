First, integrating federated learning with optical sensing requires a deep understanding of both machine learning and optical engineering, which are complex domains. Naive approaches may fail because they often overlook the intricacies of data privacy, real-time processing, and noise reduction in diverse environments. Additionally, the implementation of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric microring structures as adaptive filters presents technical hurdles in terms of material selection, fabrication, and calibration. There is also the challenge of developing machine learning algorithms capable of interpreting the multi-modal data effectively to ensure accurate predictions and interventions.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either machine learning applications or sensor technologies in isolation, often neglecting the integration of both for comprehensive monitoring solutions.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance.

The considerable computational and energy costs [ 43] limit their specialization\nand deployment in resource-constrained environments [30].\nTo tackle this challenge, model fusion has emerged as a promising solution [ 29]. One notable\nparadigm is model merging [ 22,26,59,60], where multiple task-specific models, or \u201cexperts\u201d, are\ncombined into a single unified model.

For each acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle:\n- 3 molecules of NADH are produced, which can be used to generate approximately 2.5\nATP each through the electron transport chain.\n- 1 molecule of FADH2 is produced, which can be used to generate approximately 1.5\nATP through the electron transport chain.\nTherefore, while only 1 ATP is produced directly in the cycle per acetyl-CoA, the\nNADH and FADH2 generated can lead to the production of additional ATP in the electron\ntransport chain. The exact number of ATP molecules produced can vary depending on the\nefficiency of the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase complex in different\norganisms and cell types.\n15Table 8: Example of a Correct MCQ and an Incorrect OSQ in MMLU.\nQuestion that is correct for MCQ and incorrect for OSQ: A tree is a connected graph\nwith no cycles.

However, this formula gives the number of trees when vertices are labeled,\nmeaning that it counts different labelings of the same tree shape as distinct. Since\nwe are interested in nonisomorphic trees (which do not consider different labelings as\ndistinct), we cannot directly use Cayley\u2019s formula.\nInstead, we need to enumerate the trees by considering their possible structures.

This increasing availability has led to a popular practice of fine-tuning these pre-trained models\nto adapt to a wide range of downstream tasks. Practitioners can independently fine-tune the same\npre-trained model, such as CLIP style models [ 45;63;69], large language models [ 6;47;55;28], etc.,\nand then release the fine-tuned models without releasing the training data. As the deployment of such\nfine-tuned models increases, combining models with identical architectures and initializations has\nemerged as a promising approach to combine their respective capabilities. This is useful, especially in\nscenarios where the training data for each task is private and cannot be shared, such as individual-level\npatient data in a hospital and behavior data in social media recommendation systems.\nExisting Related work This paper is related to many existing works on multi-objective optimization, Pareto\noptimality, task arithmetic, federated/private learning, Bayesian Appendix G, we generalize the ways to learn\nthe coefficients in (4), besides minimizing the mean square error in (5).\nG.2 Algorithm 2\nIn this section, we explain the operations of the algorithm in Figure 3 in details.

Pre-trained models\u2019 capabilities are\nenhanced, thus showing increasing significance [ 54,22,7,19]. Finetuning models on downstream\ntasks from a pre-trained model has become a standard paradigm in both NLP and vision fields [ 20,\n51,19,22,5,87], which usually leads to improved performance with less labeled data.

Therefore, efficient empowerment\nalgorithms for LLMs have become a hot research topic in recent\nyears, which could help the model developers to expand the knowl-\nedge boundaries of LLMs. A common approach to broaden the\ncapabilities of LLMs is to gather high-quality fine-tuning data and\nemploy high-performance model fine-tuning algorithms, such as\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [ 11]. Nevertheless, the cost of data\ncollection and computational infrastructure are expensive.\nModel merging [ 2,3,12,20], one of the most cutting-edge light-\nweight model empowerment solutions, aims to merge multiple\nupstream expert models with specific inference task execution ca-\npabilities into a single merged model that simultaneously possesses\nmultiple abilities. The advantage of model merging algorithms lies\nin their independence from high-performance computing devices\n(e.g., GPUs) and the need for massive training data. Meanwhile, the\nmaintenance of the model parameter scale does not incur additional\ninference costs.\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/ThuCCSLab/MergeGuard.\n2https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo.\n\ud835\udc40!\ud835\udc40\"\ud835\udc40#MergedModelUpstreamModels\nAttacker\nModelOwner\u201cHaveyoumergedmymodel?\u201d\nWatermark/FingerprintModelMerging\nSurvive?Figure 1: The IP protection experiments: Model Soups [ 20],\nTask Arithmetic [12], TIES-MERGING [22], and DARE [23].\nFirst of all, to verify model merging algorithms can indeed gener-\nate a merged LLM with multifunctionality, in Section 3.2, we merge\ntwo state-of-the-art open-source LLMs: LLaMA-2-7B-CHAT [ 18]\nand WizardMath-7B-V1.0 [ 16].

By strategically combining multiple LLMs into a single architecture,\nthis exciting development has captured the attention of researchers due to its key advantage: it\nrequires no additional training, making it an incredibly cost-effective approach for developing new\nmodels. This accessibility has fueled a surge in interest and experimentation with model merging.\nThe Open LLM Leaderboard [ 20] is now dominated by merged models, showcasing its potential for\ndemocratizing foundation model development.\nHowever, model merging is considered by many to be a form of black art or alchemy, relying on the\nmodel maker\u2019s intuition and instincts about model selection and merging recipes to create and refine a\nnew model that performs well for a particular task. Furthermore, the model maker is often required to\nhave some domain knowledge for the various different benchmark tasks. Given the large diversity of\nopen models and benchmarks in the community, human intuition can only go so far, and we believe a\nmore systematic approach for discovering new model combinations will take things much further.\nWe believe evolutionary algorithms will be able to discover more effective model merging solutions,\nand thus provide a path for automating the creation of more capable models. As a step towards this\ndirection, in this work, we show that evolution can be employed to discover novel and unintuitive\nways to merge various models to produce new models with a new combined ability. In this work, we\npresent a methodology that leverages evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the merging of foundation\nmodels. Our approach is distinguished by its ability to navigate both parameter space (weights) and\nthe data flow space (inference path), proposing a framework that integrates these two dimensions.\n1EvoLLM-JP ,EvoVLM-JP release: https://github.com/SakanaAI/evolutionary-model-mergearXiv:2403.13187v1  [cs.NE]  19 Mar 2024This work makes several key contributions to the field of foundation model development:\n1.Automated Model Composition : We introduce Evolutionary Model Merge , a general\nevolutionary method to automatically discover optimal combinations of diverse open-source\nmodels for creating new foundation models with user-specified capabilities. This approach\nharnesses the collective intelligence of existing open models, enabling the creation of\npowerful models without the need for extensive training data or compute.\n2.Cross-Domain Merging : We demonstrate that our method can discover novel ways to\nmerge models from disparate domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, non-English\nlanguage and Vision), potentially exceeding the capabilities achievable through conventional\nhuman design strategies.\n3.State-of-the-Art Performance : We showcase the effectiveness of our method by auto-\nmatically generating a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capability and a Japanese\nVision-Language Model (VLM).

[1, 2, 3] have achieved notable research breakthroughs, showcasing remarkable performance in the field of natural language processing [4]. As the scale of these models expands, LLMs showcase not only excellence in language-related tasks but also reveal expansive potential applications in diverse domains [5]. This includes a spectrum of optimization and generation tasks, representing a pivotal milestone in the evolution of artificial general intelligence. The advancement of LLMs has also catalyzed progress in technologies and methodologies across various research field [6, 7, 8]. Notably, this impact extends to evolutionary computation, offering both new opportunities and challenges. The primary goal of this review is to explore the dynamic interplay and synergies between LLMs and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), with the intention of establishing a complementary relationship between the two within the contemporary era of LLMs.\n\n\nThe LLM and EA, despite substantial disparities in objectives and principles, share a common pursuit of applicability in various scenarios, which are different from most models that aimed for high performance in specific domain problems. LLM achieves a unified approach across diverse tasks by learning from extensive data [9], while EA, as a general-purpose solver, has lower reliance on problem characteristics and information compared to traditional mathematical optimization methods [10], enabling it to solve a wider range of problems with different characteristics. Therefore, in terms of application scenarios, both EAs and LLMs demonstrate unique advantages in addressing complex problems with vast search spaces and uncertain environments [11, 5]. This similarity suggests potential complementarity and mutual inspiration between LLM and EA when dealing with large-scale and complex problems.\n\n\nAlthough LLM has achieved success in various applications, it has still faced criticism attributable to its black-box nature and inflexible searching. Due to the intricate LLM architecture, the specific details of the internal decision-making, reasoning, and generation processes are either uninterpretable or invisible for most users [12], especially in the case where commercially viable LLMs (such as GPT-4 [13]) typically keep their model parameters private. Exactly, as a classic black-box optimization technique [14], EAs hold potential for further enhancement within the black-box framework of LLM, such as prompt optimization [15] or neural architecture search (NAS) [16]. Another limitation of LLM is its finite search capability, as the search process is typically conducted in a one-shot manner without iterative progressive optimization. Moreover, the search capability of LLMs is constrained by prompts and training data, leading to a tendency to generate content that aligns with learned patterns and prompt information [17], thereby limiting global exploration of the entire search space. EA\u2019s search superiority can mitigate this limitation in LLM. Firstly, EA is an iterative optimization method that can continuously evolve and improve the solutions generated by LLM, thus enhancing result quality. Additionally, EA can achieve more flexible search through well-designed searching space and evolutionary operator [18, 19]. The search capacity of EA proves particularly advantageous for complex tasks that require adequate optimization.

Interestingly, one can draw an analogy between (146) in Lemma 10 and learning a linear binary classifier:\n(i)Features : The state-action representation can be viewed as the feature vector of a training sample; (ii) Labels : The sign\nofA\u03c02(s, a)resembles a binary label; (iii) Classifiers :\u03c01(a|s)\u2212\u03c02(a|s)serves as the prediction of a linear classifier. We\nprovide the intuition behind using \u03c01(a|s)\u2212\u03c02(a|s)as a classifier. Let\u2019s fix \u03c02and let \u03c01be the improved policy. If the sign\nofA\u03c02(s, a)\u22650, which implies that the action ahas a positive effect on the total return, it is desired to slightly tune up the\nprobability of acting in action a. Thus, the update \u03c01must have a greater probability on action ain order to obtain the sufficient\ncondition of the state-wise policy improvement, i.e., (\u03c01(a|s)\u2212\u03c02(a|s))A\u03c02(s, a)\u22650. Next, we substantiate this insight and\nrethink PPO-Clip via hinge loss.\nAs described in Section 3, one major component of the proof of Theorem 1 is the state-wise policy improvement property of\nPPO-Clip. For ease of exposition, we introduce the following definition regarding the partial ordering over policies.\nDefinition 1 (Partial ordering over policies) .Let\u03c01and\u03c02be two policies. Then, \u03c01\u2265\u03c02, called \u03c01improves upon \u03c02, if and\nonly if V\u03c01(s)\u2265V\u03c02(s),\u2200s\u2208 S. Moreover, we say \u03c01> \u03c02, called \u03c01strictly improves upon \u03c02, if and only if \u03c01\u2265\u03c02and\nthere exists at least one state ssuch that V\u03c01(s)> V\u03c02(s).\nLemma 11 (Sufficient condition of state-wise policy improvement) .Given any two policies \u03c01and\u03c02, we have \u03c01\u2265\u03c02if the\nfollowing condition holds:X\na\u2208A\u03c01(a|s)A\u03c02(s, a)\u22650,\u2200s\u2208 S. (148)\nProof of Lemma 11. This is the same result of the proof of Lemma 10.\nNext, we present two critical properties that hold under PPO-Clip for every sample path.\nLemma 12 (Strict improvement and strict positivity of policy under PPO-Clip with direct tabular parameterization) .In any\niteration t, suppose \u03c0(t)is strictly positive in all state-action pairs, i.e., \u03c0(t)(a|s)>0, for all (s, a). Under PPO-Clip in\nAlgorithm 7, \u03c0(t+1)satisfies that (i) \u03c0(t+1)> \u03c0(t)and (ii) \u03c0(t+1)(a|s)>0, for all (s, a).\nProof of Lemma 12. Consider the t-th iteration of PPO-Clip (cf. Algorithm 7) and the corresponding update from \u03c0(t)to\u03c0(t+1).\nRegarding (ii), recall from Algorithm 8 that K(t)denotes the number of iterations undergone by the EMDA subroutine for the\nupdate from \u03c0(t)to\u03c0(t+1)and that K(t)is designed to be finite. Therefore, it is easy to verify that \u03c0(t+1)(a|s)>0for all (s, a)\nby the exponentiated gradient update scheme of EMDA and the strict positivity of \u03c0(t).\nNext, for ease of exposition, for each k\u2208 {0,1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, K(t)}and for each state-action pair (s, a), lete\u03b8(k)\ns,adenote\nthe policy parameter after kEMDA iterations.

Note that as the weights in the loss function only affects the effective step sizes of EMDA, we simply\nset the weights of PPO-Clip to be one, without", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, foundational models\u00a0[3] have become instrumental tools, exhibiting unprecedented efficacy across multiple domains. These models are characterized by their extensive scale, generality, and capacity to learn and generalize knowledge from vast datasets, offering promising solutions to a diverse range of problems. The inherent ability of foundational models to be fine-tuned has led to advancements in natural language processing (NLP)\u00a0[43, 44, 14, 32, 45, 30], computer vision\u00a0[42, 49, 34, 25, 5], and other related fields\u00a0[50, 62, 51].\n\n\nOn one hand, the scalability of expanding foundational models to increase the number of tasks they can perform in practice poses a significant challenge as approaches such as joint training are limited in many practical scenarios\u00a0[8, 9]. In domains such as healthcare, stringent data privacy concerns often prohibit access to the underlying training data, even when the fine-tuned model on the said data is publicly accessible, rendering joint training infeasible\u00a0[2, 10]. Even in scenarios where access to training data is possible, the computational demands of simultaneous training on a multitude of tasks becomes restraining.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the widespread adoption of foundational models has led to a certain homogenization in the field\u00a0[3]. Both the training approach, commonly transfer learning from a popular foundational model\u00a0[41], and the model architecture itself have become standardized, typically following a few popular foundation models. This standardization has resulted in a proliferation of publicly available fine-tuned models, all sharing the same architecture\u00a0[56, 61, 12, 18]. However, beyond their conventional use for model inference, these numerous fine-tuned models remain largely untapped, representing a missed opportunity\u00a0[48].\n\n\nTo address the challenges of scalability, practical constraints, and unlock the untapped potential of the growing pool of publicly available fine-tuned models, recent developments in neural network weight averaging techniques have gained attention\u00a0[23, 11, 39, 48, 21, 58, 57, 6, 16, 60]. These approaches enable the practitioners to re-purpose the increasingly valuable publicly available fine-tuned models.\n\n\nCloser to our approach, Task Arithmetic were introduced by Ilharco et al.\u00a0[21]. In their method, a foundation model is refined by incorporating the scaled average of the differences between multiple fine-tuned models and the foundation model. This allows for the creation of a multi-task model without the need for additional training or access to the original training data. However, despite its potential, the Task Arithmetic method\u00a0[21] encounters limitations when dealing with numerous tasks. This is mainly due to its dependence on hyperparameter tuning through validation set performance, a process that becomes computationally impractical at scale, coupled with an increasing accumulation of noise as more tasks are merged to the foundation model.\n\n\nTo address these challenges and to capitalize on the untapped resources within the field, our paper introduces Model Breadcrumbs, a simple solution designed to tackle scalability, noise reduction in merging tasks, and hyperparameter generalization issues. Model Breadcrumbs constructs multi-task models from pre-existing fine-tuned models (see Figure\u00a01), surpassing limitations faced by existing methods. We demonstrate that Model Breadcrumbs not only yields competitive multi-task models but also provides hyperparameters that generalize effectively as the number of tasks increases. In Section\u00a02, we provide context through a review of related work.

LM, MATH, and Code are abbreviations of WizardLM-13B, WizardMath-13B, and llama-2-13b-code-alpaca.\n\n\nHuman beings have harbored a longstanding desire to acquire additional abilities through various ways, as expressed in mediums like movies and games. For example, in X-Men\u2019s Apocalypse, the character can absorb the powers of other mutants to strengthen himself. Likewise, the protagonist in the Super Mario games can gain superpowers like throwing fireballs by absorbing in-game items. In this paper, we astonishingly find that Language Models (LMs), similar to Apocalypse and Super Mario, can enhance their capabilities by absorbing other models without the need for retraining or even GPUs.\n\n\nFormally, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the most widely adopted strategy for unlocking task-specific abilities to LMs by optimizing their parameters (Dodge et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2023). The effectiveness of SFT is fully evident in the alteration of the model parameters before and after SFT, referred to as delta parameters (Ding et\u00a0al., 2023). We first show that SFT LM (either encoder- or decoder-based) always tends to acquire excessively redundant delta parameters. To be specific, we present DARE (Drop And REscale), which randomly sets certain delta parameters to zeros with a drop rate p\ud835\udc5dpitalic_p and subsequently rescales the remaining ones by a factor of 1/(1\u2212p)11\ud835\udc5d1/(1-p)1 / ( 1 - italic_p ). Although conceptually simple, DARE can eliminate up to 99% delta parameters with minimal impact on the performance when the LM\u2019s parameters reach 70 billion (see Figure 1(a)). Moreover, the more parameters the LM has, the larger p\ud835\udc5dpitalic_p it can tolerate. We attribute the effectiveness of DARE to its ability to approximate the original embeddings, which is verified theoretically and empirically.\n\n\nFurthermore, we can merge multiple homologous SFT LMs (fine-tuned from the same backbone) based on DARE without compromising their capabilities. As long as a small portion of the delta parameters remain unaffected during merging, the abilities of LMs unlocked by SFT can still be preserved. We first employ DARE to eliminate redundant delta parameters in each model before merging, which can potentially mitigate the interference of parameters among multiple models (Yadav et\u00a0al., 2023). Then, we apply established model merging techniques (Wortsman et\u00a0al., 2022; Ilharco et\u00a0al., 2023; Matena & Raffel, 2022; Jin et\u00a0al., 2023; Yadav et\u00a0al., 2023) to fuse the parameters with reduced redundancy for creating one model with diverse capabilities.\n\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments with encoder-based LMs on GLUE benchmark, and decoder-based LMs with three distinct abilities: instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code-generating. We observe that:\n\n\n(1) SFT LMs exhibit a substantial number of redundant delta parameters regardless of their backbones (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA, Llama 2, or Code Llama). DARE can remove 90% or even 99% delta parameters without significantly affecting the model performance. DARE is able to approximate the original embeddings well and provide very similar embeddings for each layer of the LM. The rescale operation is crucial to guarantee the success of DARE, and dropping 30% or 40% delta parameters", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) power a rapidly increasing number of applications, having reached a proficiency in natural language that allows them to be commanded and prompted to perform a variety of tasks\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b).\nBy utilizing large, in-domain datasets, their efficacy can be greatly improved for applications that require a combination of both natural and domain-specific language and understanding of specialized terminology.\nBy training on domain-specific datasets, they have proved effective more broadly on applications that require advanced natural language understanding.\nA prominent use-case is the formal interaction with computer systems, such as program synthesis from natural language specifications, code completion, debugging, and generating documentation (for a survey, see Xu & Zhu, 2022, also see Section\u00a05).\nIn this work, we present Code\u00a0Llama, a family of LLMs for code generation and infilling derived from Llama\u00a02 (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b) and released under the same custom permissive license.\nWe provide inference code for both completion and infilling models in the accompanying repository.11footnotemark: 1\nOur approach is based on gradually specializing and increasing the capabilities of Llama\u00a02 models by applying a cascade of training and fine-tuning steps (Figure\u00a02): 00footnotetext: \u2020\u2020\\dagger\u2020: Core contributors. \u2217\u2217\\ast\u2217: Meta AI, CERMICS \u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech. \u22c4\u22c4\\diamond\u22c4: Meta AI & Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n\n\n\u2022\n\nCode-training from foundation models. While most LLMs for code generation such as AlphaCode (Li et\u00a0al., 2022), InCoder (Fried et\u00a0al., 2023) or StarCoder (Li et\u00a0al., 2023) are trained on code only, Codex\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2021) was fine-tuned from a general language model. We also start from a foundation model (Llama\u00a02, Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b) pretrained on general-purpose text and code data. Our comparison (Section\u00a03.4.1) shows that initializing our model with Llama\u00a02 outperforms the same architecture trained on code only for a given budget.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nInfilling. Autoregressive training and fine-tuning of LLMs is suitable for prompt completion, but does not provide the capability to fill a missing portion of text while taking the full surrounding context into account.\nOur code-training for 7B, 13B and 70B Code\u00a0Llama models features a multitask objective (Fried et\u00a0al., 2023) consisting of both autoregressive and causal infilling prediction, enabling applications such as real-time completion in source code editors or docstring generation.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nLong input contexts. Unlocking repository-level reasoning for completion or synthesis \u2013 as opposed to function-level or file-level \u2013 requires prompting the model with much longer context than the 4,096 tokens supported by Llama\u00a02. We propose an additional fine-tuning stage that extends the maximum context length from 4,096 tokens to 100,000 tokens by modifying the parameters of the RoPE positional embeddings (Su et\u00a0al., 2021) used in Llama\u00a02. Our experiments show Code\u00a0Llama operating on very large contexts with a moderate impact on performances on standard coding benchmarks (Section\u00a03.3).\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nInstruction fine-tuning. For end-users, the utility of LLMs is significantly improved by instruction fine-tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b), which also helps preventing unsafe, toxic or biased generations. Code\u00a0Llama\u00a0-\u00a0Instruct variants are further fine-tuned on a mix of proprietary instruction data for improved safety and helpfulness, and a new machine-generated self-instruct dataset created by prompting Llama\u00a02 for coding problems and Code\u00a0Llama to generate associated unit tests and solutions. Our results show that Code\u00a0Llama\u00a0-\u00a0Instruct significantly", " Introduction\nRecently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention and become\nthe go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain\nconversation [ 1\u20134], coding [ 5\u201313] and math [ 14\u201319].

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the \ufb01eld of LLMs.\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Ho\ufb00mann et al.,\n2022) rede\ufb01ned those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights.

A parallel discourse has unfolded around the", " Introduction\nPre-trained models (PTMs) have become widespread in many real-world applications [ 91,6]. Using\nPTMs typically involves fine-tuning them to specialize on a specific task [ 69,12], which can lead to\nimproved performance with less task-specific labeled data. These benefits have resulted in the release\nof thousands of finetuned checkpoints [ 81] derived from popular PTMs such as ViT [ 14] for vision\nand T5 [ 58] for language. However, having a separate fine-tuned model for each task has various\ndrawbacks: (1) for each new application, a separate model has to be stored and deployed [ 17,89], and\n(2) models trained in isolation cannot leverage information from related tasks to improve in-domain\nperformance or out-of-domain generalization [ 66,58,75]. Multitask learning [ 66,57] could address\nthese concerns but requires costly training and simultaneous access to all tasks [ 17]. Moreover, it can\nbe complex and resource-intensive to determine how best to mix datasets to ensure that multitask\ntraining is beneficial for all tasks [55, 54, 80, 52, 2, 17].\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/prateeky2806/ties-merging\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2306.01708v2  [cs.LG]  27 Oct 2023Task V ectors  Trimmed T ask V ectors  \n(1) Trim\n(2) Elect SignAligned V alues\nSign V ector \nMerged T ask\nVector (3) Disjoint Merge: Influential values\n: Redundant values: Parameter: Model 1\n: Model 2: Model 3\n: Merged ModelFigure 1: A depiction of the steps involved in TIES-MERGING . We visualize each parameter in\na model as a square. The arrows depict the update (task vector, \u03c4) to a parameter produced by\nfine-tuning on different tasks (coded by colors), with direction denoting sign and length denoting\nmagnitude.

Finally, we pick\nonly the values that align with the elected sign and take their mean as the final parameter value.\nRecently, a growing body of research has focused on model merging [40]. One application of merging\ninvolves combining multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without performing\nadditional training. Previous works merge models by summing the individual model weights with\ndifferent weighting schemes, either via a simple average [ 9,28,83], via more sophisticated means\nthat incorporate parameter importance [ 45] or account for permutation invariances [ 1,31,70,74,42].\nCombining fine-tuned models in this way can be seen as adding together task vectors [29] that are\ncomputed by subtracting the pre-trained model\u2019s parameter values from those of the fine-tuned model.\nOriginal V alues\n No Interference  Redundant  Sign Conflict Mean TIESMerged V alues\nModel 1 Model 2\nFigure 2: Different types of conflict and\nmerged outputs produced by either averaging\norTIES-MERGING .

Despite these advancements, it\u2019s essential to note that the triumph of LLMs does not\neffortlessly extend to pure vision and vision-language tasks, due to the inherent disparities between\nmodalities and task formats.\nThe field of computer vision presents a unique set of challenges and paradigms that differ from\nthose of NLP. The traditional paradigm of vision foundation models is pre-training followed by\nfine-tuning [ 59,12,51,61,18,52], which is effective but comes with significant marginal costs\nwhen adapting to diverse downstream scenarios. As shown in Figure 1a, while approaches such as\nmulti-task unification [ 44,58,1,57,81] have been used to achieve generalist capability, they often\nstruggle to overcome the limitations imposed by pre-defined tasks, resulting in a gap in open-ended\n\u2217Equal contribution.

Unlike current vision generalist\nmodels that depend on pre-defined task formats and visual prompt tuning models that are inconsistent\nwith large language models (LLMs), VisionLLM leverages the power of LLMs for open-ended vision\ntasks by using language instructions.\ntask capabilities compared to LLMs. Recently, visual prompt tuning [ 26,74,79,76,62] has emerged\nas a way to flexibly outline some pure vision tasks (see Figure 1b), such as object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and pose estimation, using visual masking. However, the format of visual prompts\nconsiderably deviates from that of language instructions, making it challenging to directly apply the\nreasoning abilities and world knowledge of LLMs to vision tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent\nneed for a unified generalist framework that can seamlessly integrate the strengths of LLMs with the\nspecific requirements of vision-centric tasks.\nIn this work, we present VisionLLM, a novel framework that aligns the definitions of vision-centric\ntasks with the methodologies of LLMs. Leveraging the reasoning and parsing capacities of LLMs,\nVisionLLM is designed to empower open-ended task capabilities for vision-centric tasks. Specifically,\nit comprises three core components: (1) a unified language instruction designed for vision and\nvision-language tasks, (2) a language-guided image tokenizer, and (3) an LLM-based open-ended\ntask decoder that orchestrates various tasks using language instructions. With this framework, a\nwide range of vision-centric tasks can be seamlessly integrated, including object detection, instance\nsegmentation, image captioning, and visual grounding. In addition, the framework also facilitates\ntask customization at different levels of granularity, allowing for the customization of target objects,\noutput formats, task descriptions, etc.\nCompared to current popular API-based applications [ 68,73,50,35,30], our model takes a unified,\nend-to-end approach to integrate VFMs and LLMs, streamlining and enhancing the overall efficiency\nof the overall process, and leveraging the strengths and data of both VFMs and LLMs within a\nsingle, cohesive system.", " Introduction\nOpen-vocabulary models are characterized by their ability to perform any image classi\ufb01cation task\nbased on text descriptions of the classes [ 56]. Thanks to advances in large-scale pre-training, recent\nexamples of open-vocabulary models such as CLIP and BASIC have reached parity with or surpassed\nimportant task-speci\ufb01c baselines, even when the open-vocabulary models are not \ufb01ne-tuned on\ntask-speci\ufb01c data (i.e., in a zero-shot setting) [ 57,31,56,88,1,86]. For instance, the largest CLIP\nmodel from Radford et al. [57] used in a zero-shot setting matches the ImageNet accuracy of a\nResNet-50 trained on 1.2 million ImageNet images [14, 24].\nNevertheless, current open-vocabulary models still face challenges. The same CLIP model that\nmatches a ResNet-50 on ImageNet has lower MNIST accuracy than simple logistic regression in\npixel space [ 57]. Moreover, even when zero-shot models achieve good performance, they are usually\nstill worse than models trained or \ufb01ne-tuned on speci\ufb01c downstream tasks.\n\u0003Equal contribution.

We wish to improve ac-\ncuracy on tasks where a model performs poorly ( patching\ntasks ), without degrading performance on tasks where\naccuracy is already adequate ( supported tasks ). When\ninterpolating weights of \ufb01ne-tuned models and zero-\nshot (unpatched) models, there are intermediate solu-\ntions where accuracy improves on the patching task\nwithout reducing accuracy on supported tasks. Results are shown for nine patching\ntasks, for three different random seeds that control the order in which datasets are seen.

The accuracy\ndistance of using a single, patched model to using multiple specialized models increases with with\nthe number of patched tasks, leaving headroom for future work on more sophisticated sequential\nstrategies for patching. Interestingly, sequential patching outperforms sequential \ufb01ne-tuning (where\nno interpolation is used) by a large margin.\nJ.3 SplitCIFAR\nFigure 31 compares the patching results for\nvarious strategies for patching on multiple tasks.\n44Cars DTD EuroSAT GTSRB KITTI MNIST RESISC45 SUN397 SVHN\n\u000b S P S P S P S P S P S P S P S P S P Avg\nB/320.00 63.4 59.6 63.4 44.1 63.4 45.9 63.4 32.4 63.4 22.6 63.4 48.3 63.4 60.7 63.4 63.1 63.4 31.5 54.4\n0.05 63.4 61.9 63.4 47.0 63.4 63.4 63.4 39.7 63.4 25.5 63.4 60.9 63.5 65.9 63.5 64.4 63.4 39.9 57.7\n0.10 63.3 63.8 63.4 50.1 63.3 74.3 63.3 48.1 63.4 35.7 63.3 77.0 63.6 71.0 63.5 65.9 63.4 50.1 61.5\n0.15 63.3 65.5 63.4 53.7 63.2 82.0 63.2 57.6 63.5 47.5 63.2 87.3 63.5 75.9 63.5 67.2 63.3 60.9 64.9\n0.20 63.2 67.4 63.3 56.5 63.0 89.3 63.0 68.3 63.4 55.6 62.8 92.6 63.5 79.9 63.4 68.5 63.1 70.4 67.6\n0.25 63.1 69.1 63.1 59.7 62.7 93.3 62.8 78.5 63.3 60.2 62.4 95.7 63.3 83.7 63.3 69.5 62.8 78.3 69.7\n0.30 63.0 70.7 62.9 62.8 62.4 95.4 62.4 85.9 63.1 66.1 62.1 97.3 63.2 86.6 63.2 70.5 62.6 84.3 71.4\n0.35 62.8 72.4 62.7 65.7 62.0 96.4 62.0 90.9 62.8 69.3 61.7 98.5 63.0 89.1 63.1 71.6 62.1 88.8 72.5\n0.40 62.5 73.6 62.4 68.1 61.5 97.0 61.3 93.9 62.6 72.3 61.2 99.0 62.7", " introduction and survey of esti-\nmation of distribution algorithms,\u201d Swarm and evolutionary computation ,JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL.

Cheng, Y", " Introduction\nIn recent years, research has shown that models pre-trained\non large and diverse datasets learn representations that trans-\nfer well to a variety of tasks. As a result, machine learning\npractitioners now commonly develop solutions for down-\nstream tasks by \ufb01ne-tuning large pre-trained models (Gir-\nshick et al., 2014; Yosinski et al., 2014; Kornblith et al.,\n2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). Typically, the \ufb01ne-tuning\nprocess involves two steps: (1) \ufb01ne-tune models with a va-\nriety of hyperparameter con\ufb01gurations, and (2) select the\nmodel which achieves the highest accuracy on the held-out\nvalidation set. The remaining models are then discarded.\nSelecting a single model and discarding the rest has several\ndownsides. For one, ensembling outputs of many models\ncan outperform the best single model, albeit at a high com-\nputational cost during inference. For another, \ufb01ne-tuning a\nmodel on downstream tasks can sometimes reduce out-of-\ndistribution performance (Radford et al., 2021; Andreassen\net al., 2021; Wortsman et al., 2021; Pham et al., 2021), and\nthe best single model on the target distribution may not be\nthe best model on out-of-distribution data.\nIn this work, we propose a more accurate and robust alter-\nnative to the second step of the conventional recipe in the\ncontext of \ufb01ne-tuning a large pre-trained model. Instead of\nselecting the individual \ufb01ne-tuned model which achieves the\nhighest accuracy on the held-out validation set, we average\nthe weights of models \ufb01ne-tuned independently, and refer to\nthe result as a model soup . Given the related work.\n2. Method\nThis section highlights three recipes for model souping, the\nuniform ,greedy , and learned soup, though the greedy soup\nis our central method. We summarize the methods of data augmentation as we conduct a random hyperparameter search.Model soups: averaging weights of multiple \ufb01ne-tuned models improves accuracy without increasing inference time\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nNumber of ingredients (models)\u22124\u221220246810Percentage point \u2206from CLIP zero-shot\nCross-dataset soup\nZero-shot CLIP\n0 2 4 6 8\nAverage percentage point \u2206when including soup ingredientCIFAR10ImageNetSUN397Food101CarsDTD\nFigure E.1: Model soups can improve zero-shot performance on new downstream tasks.

Experiments\nThis section presents our key experimental \ufb01ndings. We\nbegin with experimental setup (Section 3.1) then provide\nintuition for model soups by examining", " Introduction\nHow should we transfer knowledge and capabilities across trained models? One popular approach\nis transfer learning [ 44], which \ufb01ne-tunes a pre-trained model on a target task through additional\ngradient-based training. The preparatory step of pre-training the model on a data-rich task ideally\ninstills useful \u201cknowledge\u201d into the network\u2019s parameters, which allows the model to learn more\nrapidly and effectively when \ufb01ne-tuned on a downstream task of interest. Transfer learning has\ntherefore become a particularly important and omnipresent tool across many \ufb01elds, including natural\nlanguage processing [ 57,13,9,52,53,46] and computer vision [ 43,24,68]. Recently, it has been\nshown that training on an \u201cintermediate\u201d task between pre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning can further boost\nperformance through additional transfer of capabilities from the intermediate task [ 47,60,51,48].\nAlternatively, continued self-supervised training on unlabeled domain-specialized data can serve as a\nform of domain adaptation [19].\nAll of the aforementioned transfer learning results on GLUE with BERT-base. Columns correspond to target\ntasks while rows correspond to intermediate tasks. Subscripts denote standard deviation across runs.\nItalicized values represent \ufb01ne-tuning directly on the target task (i.e. no intermediate-task training).\nTASK COLA MRPC STS-B RTE\nCOLA 55 :41:8 85:00:9 85:90:8 62:12:3\nSST-2 56:81:4 85:40:9 85:31:0 63:81:0\nMRPC 58:50:484 :50:3 85:30:8 62:75:2\nSTS-B 56:30:4 86:70:786 :10:9 64:52:5\nQQP 56:02:0 87:11:2 87:50:4 71:61:9\nMNLI 58:61:7 85:90:8 87:60:3 77:41:6\nQNLI 56:41:9 87:80:6 87:10:5 71:04:1\nRTE 56:70:9 82:22:5 85:80:563 :71:7\nTable A4: Effect of the number of examples used to compute the Fisher information.

Section 3 provides experimental conclusions and thoughts on future work in section 5.\n2 Weighted Parameter Averaging for Model Merging\nOur focus is on procedures for model merging , i.e. averaging the parameters of models that share\nan architecture and initialization. In this section, we \ufb01rst frame the common practice of averaging\ntogether model parameters as approximately maximizing the joint likelihood of model posteriors.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we show that parameter averaging corresponds to using an isotropic Gaussian as the\napproximate posterior for each model. We then introduce Fisher merging , which uses the model\u2019s\ndiagonal Fisher information matrix as the precision matrix of the Gaussian approximate posterior.\nFisher merging can be implemented by setting each merged parameter value to a weighted average of\nthe corresponding parameter values from the original models, with the weighting for each parameter\ndetermined by its Fisher information. In addition, we add model-level weightings as additional\nhyperparameters to set the relative importance of each model.\n2.1 Isotropic merging\nConsider the problem setting where we have Mtrained neural networks with parameters \u00121;:::;\u0012M\nand our goal is to create a single neural network with parameters \u0012that, loosely speaking, inherits\nthe capabilities of the Mtrained neural networks. Assume that all of these neural networks share a\ncommon architecture and had the same set of initial parameter values before being trained. Merging\nattacks this problem by \ufb01nding the parameters \u0012that maximize the", " Introduction\nIn recent years, large language models have demonstrated impressive skills\nacross many diverse tasks (Wang et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Kaplan\net al. (2020) describe the consistent bene\fts of increasing model size, character-\nizing scaling trends that hold across many orders of magnitude. However, even\nthe largest models falter when required to perform multi-step mathematical rea-\nsoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Model samples frequently contain catastrophic\nmistakes, even after the model has been appropriately \fnetuned. Mathematical\nreasoning thus reveals a critical weakness in modern language models.\nOne signi\fcant challenge in mathematical reasoning is the high sensitivity\nto individual mistakes (Shen et al., 2021a). When generating a solution, au-\ntoregressive models have no mechanism to correct their own errors. Solutions\nthat veer o\u000b-course quickly become unrecoverable. If we rely purely on genera-\ntive methods that scale even\nbetter.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dan Hendrycks, Leo Gao, Alec Radford, and Giambattista Paras-\ncandolo for their valuable feedback on this paper; Harri Edwards, Yura Burda,\nMichael Wu, and Nick Ryder for many insightful conversations; Michael Petrov,\nAlethea Power, and Jacob Jackson for their technical assistance; the OpenAI\nSupercomputing team for the infrastructure that made these results in this\npaper, had some minor implementation bugs. Our reported test performance\nis therefore a slight underestimate, though the magnitude of this discrepancy is\nless than 1% in most Appendix F for a\nvisualization of veri\fer con\fdence.\n4.3 Veri\fcation Ablations\nWe can either train veri\fers to make a single scalar prediction conditioned on\nthe entire generated solution, or to make a scalar prediction after each token\nin the solution. By default, we choose the latter, training veri\fers to make\npredictions after each token. This can be viewed as a token-level value function.\nWe compare these two Related Work\n3.1 Related Datasets\nEarly math word problem datasets (Kushman et al., 2014; Roy and Roth, 2015)\nare relatively small and are not well suited for testing the limits of modern lan-\nguage models. Dolphin18K (Huang et al., 2016) is a larger dataset containing\n318K problems, but solutions are provided only in the form of equations or \f-\nnal answers. AQuA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017) contains 100K problems, but this\ndataset unfortunately su\u000bers from both a high degree of problem templatiza-\ntion and poor quality control of the natural language solutions. MathQA is\na recently released subset of AQuA-RAT focused on correcting these mistakes\n(Amini et al., 2019), but even the corrected dataset has data quality issues, with\naround 30% of the data having inconsistencies (Miao et al., 2021). Ape210K\n(Zhao et al., 2020) is the largest publicly available dataset, consisting of 210K\nChinese elementary school-level math problems. However, due to the language\nbarrier and the lack of natural language solutions, we're unable to evaluate our background color of the text corresponds to the ver-\ni\fer score for that token, where red is low value (predicted incorrect) and green\n21is high value (predicted correct). The second column of the table summarizes\nthe veri\fer's prediction, and the third column indicates whether the generated\nmodel completion was actually correct or incorrect. Any disagreement between\nthe second and third columns indicates that the veri\fer made an error.\nThe \frst row includes a true positive example, where the veri\fer correctly\nclassi\fes the completion as correct. Note that the model is initially unsure about\nwhether the solution is correct and gradually gains certainty as the solution\nprogresses:", " Introduction\nScalable sequence prediction models (Graves, 2014;\nVaswani et al., 2017; Child et al., 2019) have become a\ngeneral-purpose method for generation and representation\nlearning in many domains, including natural language pro-\ncessing (Mikolov et al., 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Dai &\nLe, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin\net al., 2018), computer vision (Van Oord et al., 2016; Menick\n& Kalchbrenner, 2018; Chen et al., 2020; Bao et al., 2021),\naudio and speech processing (Oord et al., 2016; 2018; Dhari-\nwal et al., 2020; Baevski et al., 2020), biology (Alley et al.,\n2019; Rives et al., 2021), and even across multiple modali-\nties (Das et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019; Ramesh et al., 2021;\nZellers et al., 2021). More recently, language models have\nalso fueled progress towards the longstanding challenge\nof program synthesis (Simon, 1963; Manna & Waldinger,\n1971), spurred by the presence of code in large datasets\n(Husain et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020) and the resulting pro-\ngramming capabilities of language models trained on these\ndatasets (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021). Popular language\nmodeling objectives like masked language modeling (Devlin\net al., 2018) and span prediction (Raffel et al., 2020) have\nalso been adapted to train their programming counterparts\nCodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) and PyMT5 (Clement et al.,\n2020).\nSimilarly, our early investigation of GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\n2020) revealed that it could generate simple programs from\nPython docstrings. While rudimentary, this capability was\nexciting because GPT-3 was not explicitly trained for code\ngeneration. Given the considerable success of large lan-\nguage models in other modalities and the abundance of\npublicly available code, we hypothesized that a specialized\nGPT model, called Codex, could excel at a variety of coding\ntasks. This paper describes several early Codex models,\nwhose descendants power GitHub Copilot and the Codex\nmodels in the OpenAI API.arXiv:2107.03374v2  [cs.LG]  14 Jul 2021Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 1. Pass rates of our models on the HumanEval dataset as a\nfunction of model size. When a single sample is generated for each\nproblem, GPT-12B solves no problems, but Codex (\ufb01ne-tuned\non code) solves 28.8% of the problems, and Codex-S (further\n\ufb01ne-tuned on correctly implemented standalone functions) solves\n37.7% of the problems. From here, further gains can be realized by\ngenerating 100 samples per problem and selecting the sample with\nthe highest mean log-probability (44.5% solved) or by selecting\nthe sample that passes the unit tests (77.5% solved). All samples\nare generated with temperature 0.8.\nIn this work, we focus on the task of generating stan-\ndalone Python functions from docstrings, and evaluate the\ncorrectness of code samples automatically through unit\ntests. This is in contrast to natural language generation,\nwhere samples are typically evaluated by heuristics or by\nhuman evaluators. To accurately benchmark our model,\nwe create a dataset of 164 original programming problems\nwith unit tests. These problems assess language compre-\nhension, algorithms, and simple mathematics, with some\ncomparable to simple software interview questions. We\nrelease this data along with an evaluation framework at\nhttps://www.github.com/openai/human-eval.\nTo solve a problem in our test set, we generate multiple\nsamples from the models, and check if any of them pass the\nunit tests. With just a single sample, a 12B parameter Codex\nsolves 28.8% of these problems, and a 300M parameter\nCodex solves 13.2% of these problems.

Model Hyperparameters\nHyperparameter Value\nBatch size", "ABSTRACT\nWhile the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural\nlanguage processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In\nvision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or\nused to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their\noverall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary\nand a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform\nvery well on image classi\ufb01cation tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of\ndata and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks\n(ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellentresults from this ablation study on a ViT-B/16 model. As we can see, while\nthere is a large gap between the performances of the model with no positional embedding and mod-\nels with positional embedding, there is little to no difference between different ways of encoding\npositional information. We speculate that since our Transformer encoder operates on patch-level\ninputs, as opposed to pixel-level, the differences in how to encode spatial information is less impor-\ntant. More precisely, in patch-level inputs, the spatial dimensions are much smaller than the original\npixel-level inputs, e.g., 14\u000214as opposed to 224\u0002224, and learning to represent the spatial re-\nlations in this resolution is equally easy for these different positional encoding strategies. Even so,\nthe speci\ufb01c pattern of position embedding similarity learned by the network depends on the training\nhyperparameters (Figure 10).\n0 5 10 15 20\nNetwork depth (layer)020406080100120Mean attention distance (pixels)\nViT-L/16\nHead 1\nHead 2\nHead 3\n...\n0 5 10 15 20\nNetwork depth (layer)020406080100120\nR50x1 + ViT-L/16\nHead 1\nHead 2\nHead 3\n...\nFigure 11: Size of attended area by head and network depth.

Architecture topology and architecture size have been regarded as two of the most\nimportant aspects for the performance of deep learning models and the community has spawned lots of searching algorithms for both\nof those aspects of the neural architectures. However, the performance gain from these searching algorithms is achieved under\ndifferent search spaces and training setups. This makes the overall performance of the algorithms incomparable and the improvement\nfrom a sub-module of the searching model unclear. In this paper, we propose NATS-Bench, a uni\ufb01ed benchmark on searching for both\ntopology and size, for (almost) any up-to-date NAS algorithm. NATS-Bench includes the search space of 15,625 neural cell candidates\nfor architecture topology and 32,768 for architecture size on three datasets. We analyze the validity of our benchmark in terms of\nvarious criteria and performance comparison of all candidates in the search space. We also show the versatility of NATS-Bench by\nbenchmarking 13 recent state-of-the-art NAS algorithms on it. All logs and diagnostic information trained using the same setup for\neach candidate are provided. This facilitates a much larger community of researchers to focus on developing better NAS algorithms in\na more comparable and computationally effective environment.

These Neural Architecture Search\n(NAS) algorithms are capable of automating the discovery\nof effective architectures (Zoph & Le, 2017; Zoph et al.,\n2018; Pham et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019;\nReal et al., 2019).\nNAS algorithms are broadly based on the seminal work\nof Zoph & Le (2017). A controller network generates an\narchitecture proposal, which is then trained to provide a\nsignal to the controller through REINFORCE (Williams,\n1992), which then produces a new proposal, and so on.\nTraining a network for every controller update is extremely\nexpensive; utilising 800 GPUs for 28 days in Zoph & Le\n(2017). Subsequent work has sought to ameliorate this by\n(i) learning stackable cells instead of whole networks (Zoph\net al., 2018) and (ii) incorporating weight sharing ; allow-\ning candidate networks to share weights to allow for joint\ntraining (Pham et al., 2018). These contributions have ac-\ncelerated the speed of NAS algorithms e.g. to half a day on\na single GPU in Pham et al. (2018).\nFor some practitioners, NAS is still too slow; being able to\nperform NAS quickly (i.e. in seconds) would be immensely\nuseful in the hardware-aware setting where a separate search\nis typically required for each device and task (Wu et al.,\n2019; Tan et al., 2019). This could be achieved if NAS\ncould be performed without any network training . In this\npaper we show that this is possible. We explore NAS-Bench-\n101 (Ying et al., 2019), NAS-Bench-201 (Dong & Yang,\n2020), NATS-Bench (Dong et al., 2021), and Network De-\nsign Spaces (NDS, Radosavovic et al., 2019), and examine\nthe overlap of activations between datapoints in a mini-batch\nfor an untrained network (Section 3).

In DropPath, we stochastically\ndrop out each path (i.e., edge with a yellow box in Figure\n4) in the cell with some \ufb01xed probability. This is simi-\nlar to [27] and [69] where they dropout full parts of their\nmodel during training and then at test time scale the path\nby the probability of keeping that path during training.

The leading contenders are deep Q-learning [Mni+15],\n\u201cvanilla\u201d policy gradient Background: Policy Optimization\n2.1 Policy Gradient Methods\nIn TRPO [Sch+15b], an objective function (the \u201csurrogate\u201d objective) is maximized subject to a\nconstraint on the size of the policy update. Speci\ufb01cally,\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At/bracketrightbigg\n(3)\nsubject to \u02c6Et[KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]]\u2264\u03b4. (4)\nHere,\u03b8oldis the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can e\ufb03ciently be\napproximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation\nto the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.\nThe theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,\nsolving the unconstrained optimization problem\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]/bracketrightbigg\n(5)\nfor some coe\ufb03cient \u03b2. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes\nthe max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the\nperformance of the policy \u03c0. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard\nto choose a single value of \u03b2that performs well across di\ufb00erent problems\u2014or even within a single\nproblem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal\nof a \ufb01rst-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Experiments\n6.1 Comparison of Surrogate Objectives\nFirst, we compare several di\ufb00erent surrogate objectives under di\ufb00erent hyperparameters. Here, we\ncompare the surrogate objective LCLIPto several natural variations and ablated versions.\nNo clipping or penalty: Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\nClipping: Lt(\u03b8) = min(rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At,clip(rt(\u03b8)),1\u2212/epsilon1,1 +/epsilon1)\u02c6At\nKL penalty (\ufb01xed or adaptive) Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old,\u03c0\u03b8]\n5For the KL penalty, one can either use a \ufb01xed penalty coe\ufb03cient \u03b2or an adaptive coe\ufb03cient as\ndescribed in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2\nimplemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do\none million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping ( /epsilon1)\nand the KL penalty ( \u03b2,dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in\nTable 3.\nTo represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,\nand tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard\ndeviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don\u2019t share parameters between the policy and value\nfunction (so coe\ufb03cient c1is irrelevant), and we don\u2019t use an entropy bonus.\nEach algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each\nrun of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted\nand scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best\nresult was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.\nThe Results from continuous control benchmark.

Since these updates are\nspeci\ufb01c to improving the current model, there is no reason\nto store them once they have been applied.\nA principal advantage of this approach is the decoupling of\nmodel training from the need for direct access to the raw\ntraining data. Clearly, some trust of the server coordinat-\ning the training is still required. However, for applications\nwhere the training objective can be speci\ufb01ed on the basis\nof data available on each client, federated learning can sig-\nni\ufb01cantly reduce privacy and security risks by limiting the\nattack surface to only the device, rather than the device and\nthe cloud.\nOur primary contributions are 1) the identi\ufb01cation of the\nproblem of training on decentralized data from mobile de-\nvices as an important research direction; 2) the selection of\na straightforward and practical algorithm that can be applied\nto this setting; and 3) an extensive empirical evaluation of\nthe proposed approach. More concretely, we introduce the\nFederatedAveraging algorithm, which combines lo-\ncal stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on each client with\na server that performs model averaging. We perform ex-\ntensive results on a variety of model architectures: a multi-layer\nperceptron, two different convolutional NNs, a two-layer\ncharacter LSTM, and a large-scale word-level LSTM.\nWhile federated learning offers many practical privacy ben-\ne\ufb01ts, providing stronger guarantees via differential pri-\nvacy [ 14,13,1], secure multi-party computation [ 18], or\ntheir combination is an interesting direction for future work.\nNote that both classes of techniques apply most naturally to\nsynchronous algorithms like FedAvg .8\n8Subsequent to this work, Bonawitz et al.

Textural properties have an important\nrole in object descriptions, particularly for those objects that\nare best quali\ufb01ed by a pattern, such as a shirt or the wing of\nbird or a butter\ufb02y as illustrated in Fig. 1. Nevertheless, so\nfar the attributes of textures have been investigated only tan-\ngentially. In this paper we address the question of whether\nthere exists a \u201cuniversal\u201d set of attributes that can describe a\nwide range of texture patterns, whether these can be reliably\nestimated from images, and for what tasks they are useful.\nThe study of perceptual attributes of textures has a\nlong history starting from pre-attentive aspects and group-\ning [16], to coarse high-level attributes [1, 2, 33], to some\nrecent work aimed at discovering such attributes by au-\ntomatically mining descriptions of images from the Inter-\nnet [3, 12]. However, the texture attributes investigated so\nfar are rather few or too generic for a detailed description\nmost \u201creal world\u201d patterns. Our work is motivated by the\none of Bhusan et al.

By advancing autonomous defense mechanisms, this research could lead to significant improvements in response times and operational efficiency, ultimately reducing the risk of prolonged undetected intrusions. The findings could pave the way for future research in applying reinforcement learning to other complex security scenarios, enhancing our understanding of adaptive defense strategies and their practical applications in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the dynamic and unpredictable nature of cyber threats, which require a defense system to adapt in real-time to various adversarial tactics. Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to generalize across different attack strategies, leading to overfitting on specific adversaries. Additionally, the technical complexities of creating a hierarchical agent architecture that effectively coordinates multiple specialized sub-agents pose significant obstacles. The need for high-fidelity simulations that accurately represent real-world network environments further complicates the development and testing of such systems.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has often focused on isolated aspects of network security or employed simpler models that lack the sophistication needed for real-time autonomous defense. Limitations in computational resources, the complexity of creating realistic simulation environments, and a lack of comprehensive frameworks for integrating multiple learning agents have hindered progress. Our approach differs by introducing a hierarchical architecture that combines specialized sub-agents, allowing for greater adaptability and generalization across various adversarial strategies, which has not been adequately addressed in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hierarchical reinforcement learning agent that utilizes a controller agent to select and coordinate sub-agents trained against specific adversarial strategies. We will employ the CybORG environment to simulate a realistic computer network, using metrics such as response time and effectiveness against different adversaries to evaluate performance. The expected outcomes include demonstrating superior defensive capabilities compared to single-agent approaches, showcasing the benefits of our hierarchical architecture in generalizing across various attack scenarios, and providing publicly available models and training setups for further research in the field", "proposal_5q": ["[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can a hybrid reinforcement learning framework be developed to enhance Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) that integrates adversarial training with privacy-preserving mechanisms to effectively defend against sophisticated cyber attacks while maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive user data?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem is critical for the research community as it addresses the dual challenge of cybersecurity and data privacy in an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, particularly from advanced persistent threats (APTs). The implications of this research extend to the development of resilient cybersecurity systems that can autonomously adapt to new attack strategies without compromising user privacy. This paper will pave the way for future research in the integration of machine learning techniques in cybersecurity, potentially leading to practical applications such as automated incident response systems, enhanced threat detection mechanisms, and improved compliance with privacy regulations. Moreover, by incorporating ethical decision-making processes, this approach can foster trust in autonomous systems, thus encouraging their adoption in critical sectors where human oversight is limited.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe complexity of this problem lies in the need to balance effective cyber defense with the stringent requirements of data privacy. Challenges include developing algorithms that can learn from adversarial environments while ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential, which necessitates sophisticated privacy-preserving techniques. Naive approaches may fail because they might either compromise the effectiveness of the defense mechanisms or violate privacy standards, leading to potential data breaches. Additionally, the dynamic nature of cyber threats requires a continuous adaptation of the learning models, adding to the computational complexity and the need for robust evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the agents under various attack scenarios.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has often focused on either improving the robustness of cyber defense mechanisms or on privacy-preserving techniques, but rarely have these two areas been integrated in the context of autonomous operations. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive frameworks that address the evolving nature of cyber threats while simultaneously ensuring user data confidentiality. Furthermore, there has been insufficient exploration of ethical decision-making in automated systems, which has hindered the development of accountable ACO systems. My approach differs by combining adversarial training with privacy-preserving mechanisms within a hybrid reinforcement learning framework, allowing for a more holistic solution that addresses both cybersecurity and ethical considerations.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves the development of a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that utilizes the CybORG simulation environment to train autonomous agents. The framework will incorporate adversarial training techniques to simulate various attack strategies and will employ privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as differential privacy, to protect sensitive data during the learning process. The agents will be evaluated using metrics such as attack success rate, data leakage risk, and ethical compliance. Expected outcomes include a set of robust algorithms capable of effectively defending against APTs while maintaining data confidentiality, along with a framework for ethical decision-making in autonomous cyber operations.

To support the application of machine\nlearning algorithms to solve this problem, and to\nencourage researchers in this \ufb01eld to attend to prob-\nlems in the ACO setting, we introduce CybORG, a\nwork-in-progress gym for ACO research. CybORG\nfeatures a simulation and emulation environment\nwith a common interface to facilitate the rapid\ntraining of autonomous agents that can then be\ntested on real-world systems. Initial testing demon-\nstrates the feasibility of this approach.\n1Background\nAutonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) is concerned with\nthe defence of computer systems and networks through au-\ntonomous decision-making and action. It is particularly\nneeded where deploying security experts to cover every net-\nwork and location is becoming increasingly untenable, and\nwhere systems cannot be reliably accessed by human defend-\ners, either due to unreliable communication channels or ad-\nversary action.\nThe ACO domain is challenging to develop arti\ufb01cial intelli-\ngence (AI) approaches for as it combines hard problems from\nother domains of AI research. Like game AI, it is adversar-\nial: the effectiveness of a defensive cyber agent is determined\nby its ability to respond to an adversary. Like autonomous\nrobotics, ACO is affected by the \u2018reality gap\u2019 [Ibarz et al. ,\n2021 ], as simulations of an environment willabstract away\ninformation that could be critical to an agent\u2019s effectiveness.\nA further issue for the ACO domain is that the environment\nand action set change as cyber security research progresses,\nwhich is far more rapidly than either of the domains discussed\nabove.\nThe requirement to handle the varying actions of an adver-\nsary, in a complex environment, precludes the use of static\ndata sets to learn ACO behaviour. A tool for learning in ad-\nversarial environments is an AI Gym. AI Gyms such as the\none developed by OpenAI implement reinforcement learning(RL) through direct interaction with a simulation of the prob-\nlem. A path to addressing the \u2018reality gap\u2019, used in [Tanet\nal., 2016 ], is to combine learning on simulations with testing\nin a real environment. In this case, the bulk of learning is\nconducted on simulated systems. Successful agents are trans-\nferred to the real system to \ufb01rstly validate their effectiveness,\nand secondly to re\ufb01ne the simulation.\nWe believe that AI Gyms, that can be validated and re-\n\ufb01ned throughexperiments, the requirements of ACO motivate an in-\ntegrated design comprising emulation and simulation modes\nto support large scale RL across diverse scenarios.\nWe have made progress towards implementing this design,\nwith the ability to spawn and play games either in simula-\ntion mode or emulation mode with cloud infrastructure. In\nCybORG, we can now train an RL agent in simulation then\ntest its effectiveness in emulation.

Games have\nserved as stepping stones along this path for decades, from Backgammon (1992) to Chess (1997) to\nAtari (2013)[1\u20133]. In 2016, AlphaGo defeated the world champion at Go using deep reinforcement\nlearning and Monte Carlo tree search[4]. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) models have\ntackled tasks as varied as robotic manipulation[5], text summarization [6], and video games such as\nStarcraft[7] and Minecraft[8].\nRelative to previous AI milestones like Chess or Go, complex video games start to capture the\ncomplexity and continuous nature of the real world. Dota 2 is a multiplayer real-time strategy game\nproduced by Valve Corporation in 2013, which averaged between 500,000 and 1,000,000 concurrent\nplayers between 2013 and 2019. The game is actively played by full time professionals; the prize\npool for the 2019 international championship exceeded $35 million (the largest of any esports game\nin the world)[9, 10]. The game presents challenges for reinforcement learning due to long time\nhorizons, partial observability, and high dimensionality of observation and action spaces.

We\nbuilt a distributed training system to do this which we used to train a Dota 2-playing agent called\nOpenAI Five. In April 2019, OpenAI Five defeated the Dota 2 world champions (Team OG1), the\n\ufb01rst time an AI system has beaten an esport world champion2. We also opened OpenAI Five to\nthe Dota 2 community for competitive play; OpenAI Five won 99.4% of over 7000 games.\nOne challenge we faced in training was that the environment and code continually changed as\nour project progressed. In order to train without restarting from the beginning after each change,\nwe developed a collection of tools to resume training with minimal loss in performance which we\ncallsurgery. Over the 10-month training process, we performed approximately one surgery per\ntwo weeks. These tools allowed us to make frequent improvements to our strongest agent within a\nshorter time than the typical practice of training from scratch would allow. As AI systems tackle\nlarger and harder problems, further investigation of settings with ever-changing environments and\niterative development will be critical.\nIn section 2, we describe Dota 2 in more detail along with the challenges it presents. In section 3\nwe discuss the technical components of the training system, leaving most of the details to appendices\ncited therein. In section 4, we summarize our long-running experiment and the path that lead to\ndefeating the world champions. We also describe lessons we\u2019ve learned about reinforcement learning\nwhich may generalize to other complex tasks.\n2 Dota 2\nDota 2 is played on a square map with two teams defending bases in opposite corners.

Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on.

INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC)\u00a0(Krumm et\u00a0al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender systems have been widely applied in today\u2019s short video\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), news\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2018b) and e-commerce\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2019b) platforms.\nWhile complicated models\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2020; Qin et\u00a0al., 2021; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2019). On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure\u00a01 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval. The latter will be detailed further in Section \u00a02.4.\n\n\nAlthough both the retrieval and ranking stages aim to select the most relevant items, each stage has its own unique characteristics.\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in candidate sets (i.e., inference spaces).\nThe retrieval stage needs to quickly filter through the entire item pool, which may contain millions of items; while the ranking stage only needs to score and order the items that have been selected by the retrieval methods, typically narrowing down to hundreds or thousands of items.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in input features.\nDuring the retrieval stage, due to time constraints and the need to filter through a large candidate set quickly, utilizing complex feature interactions is impractical for real-time online requirements. As a result, only limited, coarse-grained features of users and items are considered.\nIn contrast, the ranking stage can utilize a diverse set of features by designing various feature interaction operators, such as product operators\u00a0(Qu et\u00a0al., 2016), convolutional operators\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2019a), and attention operators\u00a0(Xiao et\u00a0al., 2017). The ranking stage further enhances its capability", " \n\nI Introduction\n\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated superior performance in many robotic simulators [1, 2, 3]. However, transferring the controllers learned in simulators to real robots has long been a very challenging question in the RL community. One difficulty of sim-to-real transfer is that the learned policies are highly specific to the dynamics and tasks in the simulators, making them difficult to generalize to many real-world tasks, in which sim-to-real gaps exist. In the existing practices of sim-to-real transfer methods\u00a0[4, 5, 6, 7], the controllers learned in the simulator are usually difficult to generalize across various tasks and dynamic environments.\n\n\nRecent studies in the theoretical RL community on the spectral decomposition of Markov decision processes (MDPs) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] reveal the idea of task-independent representations for RL. The results of spectral decomposition is the spectral functions of the transition dynamics in MDPs. The spectral functions can linearly represent the state-action value function, i.e., the Q\ud835\udc44Qitalic_Q-function, induced by any policy. Therefore, we say the spectral functions are task-independent representation of skills, because the spectral functions include information needed to accomplish any tasks.\nThese task-independent skill representations are shared across arbitrary tasks, thus are reusable and transferable. Meanwhile, the representation can also be used to synthesize policies.\nGiven the representation-based skill sets and a specific task, we can perform sample-efficient planning upon the skill sets to synthesize the optimal policy. When the representations are unknown, sample-efficient representation learning methods have been proposed including maximum likelihood estimation [11], contrastive learning\u00a0[13], spectral conditional density estimation [12], or variational inference [14].\n\n\nNevertheless, these representation-based skill learning are still designed for specific transition dynamics. When it applies to sim-to-real transfer,\nthe sim-to-real gap, which will induce new skills different from the simulator skill sets, has not been investigated yet.\nLearning the sim-to-real gap from real-world data, also called residual dynamics learning [15, 5, 16, 17], naturally aligns with our representation learning viewpoint. However, naively learning the representations of residual dynamics might lead us to relearn redundant skills that are linearly dependent with the existing simulator skill sets. Therefore, we need additional incentives to discover new skills that enable us to bridge the sim-to-real gap.\n\n\nTo further leverage the transferability of the representation-based skill sets and discover new skills induced by the sim-to-real gap, we proposed the Skill TransfEr And DiscoverY (STEADY) for sim-to-real representation learning algorithm. We show that recent theoretical representation learning algorithms for spectral decomposition of MDPs, such as [12, 18], can apply to learning transferable representations of real-world robots. Moreover, we handle the sim-to-real gap by augmenting distinct representation-based skills learned from the sim-to-real gap, which we refer to as skill discovery. During the learning process, orthogonal constraints between the newly discovered skill sets and the simulator skill sets are enforced to fill the sim-to-real gap.\nIn this way, we ensure that the skills necessary for the real robots are also included in our augmented skill sets, upon which the planning can be handled in a more complete space efficiently.\nMeanwhile, to ensure the policy transferring smoothly from the simulator to the real-world, we also designed a mechanism to characterize the policy", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFollowing the impressive recent success of reinforcement learning (RL) [30, 40, 31, 3] in various applications, a plethora of research has been done in improving the learning efficiency of RL algorithms. One important avenue of the extension is the Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL), in which an agent aims to continuously learn and improve its decision-making policy over sequentially arriving tasks without forgetting previously learned tasks.\nThe motivation for such extension is clear since it is not practical to either re-train an agent to learn multiple tasks seen so far or train a dedicated agent for each task whenever a new task to learn arrives. The need for CRL is particularly pressing when the sequentially arriving tasks to learn are similar to each other as in robot action learning [18].\n\n\nIn general, one of the main challenges of continual learning (CL) is to effectively transfer the learned knowledge to a new task (i.e., improve plasticity) while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge (i.e., improve stability). So far, most of the CRL methods [27, 29, 35, 46] also focus on addressing such a challenge, largely inspired by the methods developed in the supervised learning counterparts; e.g., improving the stability by regularizing the deviation of the important parameters [17, 49, 2, 16], storing the subset of dataset on previous tasks [6, 7, 22] or isolating the important parameters [26, 25, 14, 47]. Furthermore, several works mainly focused on improving the plasticity of the network by transferring the knowledge from previous tasks [37, 39] or selectively re-using the important parts for learning new tasks [29, 27, 28].\n\n\nDue to the aforementioned trade-off, it is generally understood that the plasticity degradation occurs in continual learning mainly due to the emphasis on stability. However, several recent work pointed out that, particularly in RL, the plasticity of a learner can decrease even when learning a single task [33, 21, 19, 23, 24, 41, 4], in which the stability is not considered at all. Those works identified that the occurrence of such plasticity loss may be largely due to using non-stationary targets while learning the value function.\nThese findings give some clues for understanding the plasticity degradation phenomenon in CRL, which occurs quite often not only when learning each task but also when task transition happens, but not the full explanation.\n\n\nNamely, in CRL, even when the simple fine-tuning is employed for sequentially learning tasks, it is not hard to observe that a learner already suffers from learning a new task as we show in our experiments in later sections. We may attempt to explain this plasticity degradation of fine-tuning, which does not consider stability whatsoever, through the lens of the plasticity loss mentioned above; i.e., since the non-stationarity of the learning objectives (or the reward functions) arises when task transition happens, the plasticity loss occurs and hampers the learning ability. However, as we observe from our careful empirical analyses, above explanation is not fully satisfactory since such plasticity degradation turns out to be dependent on what specific task a learner has learned previously. That is, we show that the dissimilarity between", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nA useful agent is one that can accomplish many objectives in a domain. Household robots are more beneficial the more chores they can complete; self-driving cars the more places they can reach. Building upon this premise, we draw inspiration from the recent success of unsupervised learning in language\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020) and vision\u00a0(Kirillov et\u00a0al., 2023), which has shown that a single generalist model trained on Internet-scale data can immediately solve a wide array of tasks without further training or fine-tuning. Motivated by these successes, we study an analogous way to train a generalist agent from unlabeled offline data such that it can immediately solve new user-specified tasks in a without training. This has been referred to as the zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) problem\u00a0(Touati et\u00a0al., 2022). From this data, the hard challenge is how to discover, without labels, a task representation that is robust to downstream objectives \u2013 in essence, bypassing the need for a human to specify well-shaped reward functions before training.\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to provide a simple, scalable approach to the zero-shot RL problem. Our key insight is to directly learn a latent representation that can represent any arbitrary reward functions based on their samples of state-reward pairs. We refer to this idea as Functional Reward Encoding (FRE). This is in contrast to previous works in zero-shot RL or multi-task RL that employ domain-specific task representations\u00a0(Barreto et\u00a0al., 2017; Li et\u00a0al., 2020a) or highly restrictive linear reward structures\u00a0(Borsa et\u00a0al., 2018; Touati & Ollivier, 2021; Touati et\u00a0al., 2022). By directly encoding reward functions into a latent space, we can pre-train a multi-task agent with a host of unsupervised reward functions of arbitrary diversity, and quickly identify the representations corresponding to new test tasks given a small number of reward-annotated samples.\n\n\nTraining an FRE requries utilizing a prior distribution over reward functions. When no information about downstream tasks is available, we must define a prior that broadly spans possible objectives in a domain-agnostic manner. In our experiments, we show that a mixture of random unsupervised reward functions, such as goal-reaching and random MLP rewards, are a reasonable choice for the reward prior. We optimize an FRE-conditioned policy towards all rewards within this space. In this way, approximate solutions to many downstream tasks have already been learned, and the zero-shot RL problem reduces to simply locating the FRE encoding for the task, which the learned encoder accomplishes.\n\n\nThus, our framework presents a simple yet scalable method for training zero-shot RL agents in an unsupervised manner, as shown in Figure 1. The main idea is to (1) train an FRE network over random unsupervised reward functions, then (2) optimize a generalist FRE-conditioned policy towards maximizing said rewards, after which (3) novel tasks can be solved by simply encoding samples of their reward functions, such that the FRE agent can immediately act without further training.\n\n\nWe verify the efficacy of our method through experiments on standard offline RL domains. We demonstrate that without any finetuning, FRE policies can\nsolve tasks involving locomotion of an eight-DoF robot through a maze or manipulation of a robotic arm in a kitchen", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: \nIllustration of HILPs.\n(left) We first train a distance-preserving mapping \u03d5:\ud835\udcae\u2192\ud835\udcb5:italic-\u03d5\u2192\ud835\udcae\ud835\udcb5\\phi:{\\mathcal{S}}\\to{\\mathcal{Z}}italic_\u03d5 : caligraphic_S \u2192 caligraphic_Z\nthat maps temporally similar states to spatially similar latent states (d\u2217superscript\ud835\udc51d^{*}italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2217 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT denotes the temporal distance).\n(right) We then train a latent-conditioned policy \u03c0\u2062(a\u2223s,z)\ud835\udf0bconditional\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc67\\pi(a\\mid s,z)italic_\u03c0 ( italic_a \u2223 italic_s , italic_z ), which we call a Hilbert foundation policy, that spans that latent space with directional movements. This policy captures diverse long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled data,\nwhich can be directly used to solve a variety of downstream tasks efficiently, even in a zero-shot manner.\n\n\n\nGeneralist models that can utilize large amounts of weakly labeled data provide an appealing recipe:\npre-train via self-supervised or unsupervised objectives on large and diverse datasets without ground truth labels,\nand then adapt efficiently via prompting, few-shot learning, or fine-tuning to downstream tasks.\nThis strategy has proven to be extremely effective in settings where simple self-supervised objectives can be used to train on Internet-scale data\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Ramesh et\u00a0al., 2022),\nleading to models that can quickly adapt to new tasks for pattern recognition\u00a0(Kirillov et\u00a0al., 2023),\nquestion answering\u00a0(Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022),\nand even diverse AI-assistant applications\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2021b).\nMotivated by this observation,\na number of works have recently sought to propose self-supervised objectives to pre-train generalist policies\nfor reinforcement learning (RL) and control\u00a0(Reed et\u00a0al., 2022; Padalkar et\u00a0al., 2024).\nWe can broadly refer to the resulting models as foundation policies:\ngeneral-purpose policies that can rapidly adapt to solve a variety of downstream tasks.\n\n\nHowever, unlike natural language processing,\nwhere next token prediction has become the standard pre-training objective\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020),\nfinding the best policy pre-training objective from data remains a major open question in RL.\nPrior works have proposed several ways to pre-train generalist policies\nbased on diverse objectives, such as\nbehavioral cloning (BC)\u00a0(Ajay et\u00a0al., 2021; Reed et\u00a0al., 2022; Padalkar et\u00a0al., 2024),\noffline goal-conditioned RL (GCRL)\u00a0(Chebotar et\u00a0al., 2021; Eysenbach et\u00a0al., 2022; Park et\u00a0al., 2023),\nand unsupervised skill discovery\u00a0(Gregor et\u00a0al., 2016; Machado et\u00a0al., 2017; Eysenbach et\u00a0al., 2019; Park et\u00a0al., 2024).\nHowever, none of these objectives is ideal: behavioral cloning requires expert demonstrations,\nwhich limits the availability of data,\ngoal-conditioned RL can only yield goal-reaching behaviors, and unsupervised skill discovery methods, though general and principled,\ncan present major challenges in terms of scalability, optimization, and offline learning.\n\n\nIn this work, we propose a general offline pre-training objective for foundation policies\nthat capture diverse, optimal \u201clong-horizon\u201d behaviors from unlabeled data\nto facilitate downstream task learning.\nOur main idea is to discover the temporal structure of states through offline data,\nand to represent this structure in such a way that\nwe can quickly and accurately obtain optimal policies\nfor any arbitrary new tasks from relatively concise \u201cprompts\u201d\n(e.g., a small number of states annotated with rewards, target goals, etc.).\nWe begin by learning a\ngeometric abstraction of the dataset,\nwhere distances between representations of states\ncorrespond to their long-horizon global relationships.\nSpecifically, we train a representation \u03d5:\ud835\udcae\u2192\ud835\udcb5:italic-\u03d5\u2192\ud835\udcae\ud835\udcb5\\phi:{\\mathcal{S}}\\to{\\mathcal{Z}}italic_\u03d5 : caligraphic_S \u2192 caligraphic_Z\nthat maps the state space \ud835\udcae\ud835\udcae{\\mathcal{S}}caligraphic_S into a Hilbert space \ud835\udcb5\ud835\udcb5{\\mathcal{Z}}caligraphic_Z\n(i.e., a metric space with a well-defined inner product)\nsuch that\n\n\n\nd\u2217\u2062(s,g)=\u2016\u03d5\u2062(s)\u2212\u03d5\u2062(g)\u2016superscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54normitalic-\u03d5\ud835\udc60italic-\u03d5\ud835\udc54\\displaystyle d^{*}(s,g)=\\|\\phi(s)-\\phi(g)\\|italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2217 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_s , italic_g ) = \u2225 italic_\u03d5 ( italic_s ) - italic_\u03d5 ( italic_g ) \u2225\n\n(1)\n\n\nholds for every s,g\u2208\ud835\udcae\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54\ud835\udcaes,g\\in{\\mathcal{S}}italic_s , italic_g \u2208 caligraphic_S,\nwhere d\u2217superscript\ud835\udc51d^{*}italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2217 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT denotes the temporal distance (i.e., the minimum number of time steps needed for", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDespite the success of Reinforcement Learning\u00a0(RL) in scenarios where online interaction is consistently available, RL is hampered from real-world applications such as healthcare and robotics controlling due to its sample complexity\u00a0(Haarnoja et\u00a0al. 2018) and inferior generalization ability\u00a0(Kirk et\u00a0al. 2023). The past decade witnessed tremendous effort from researchers to pave the path for RL toward real-world applications. For example, offline RL\u00a0(Fujimoto, Meger, and Precup 2019; Kumar et\u00a0al. 2020; Fujimoto and Gu 2021; Kostrikov, Nair, and Levine 2022), which optimizes the policies with a pre-collected and static dataset, provides a solution to relieving RL from costly online interactions, whereas meta-RL\u00a0(Duan et\u00a0al. 2016; Finn, Abbeel, and Levine 2017; Rakelly et\u00a0al. 2019; Zintgraf et\u00a0al. 2020; Fu et\u00a0al. 2021), which involves training policies over a wide range of tasks, significantly enhances the generalization ability of the learned policies.\n\n\nOffline Meta-Reinforcement Learning\u00a0(OMRL)\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al. 2020; Li, Yang, and Luo 2021; Dorfman, Shenfeld, and Tamar 2021; Mitchell et\u00a0al. 2021; Yuan and Lu 2022), as an intersection of offline RL and meta-RL, is promising to combine the good of both worlds. In OMRL, we are provided with datasets collected in various tasks which share some similarity in the underlying structures in dynamics or reward mechanisms, and aim to optimize the meta-policy. The meta-policy is later tested in tasks drawn from the same task distribution. Previous related methods\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al. 2020; Li, Yang, and Luo 2021; Yuan and Lu 2022) often interpret the OMRL challenge as task representation learning and meta-policy optimization. The former step aims to obtain indicative task representations from the dataset, while the latter optimizes a meta-policy on top of the learned representation.\nHowever, existing methods often assume a sufficient number of training tasks as well as sufficient diversity of behavior policy that collects the datasets, which is not realistic in real-world applications. We find that when the assumptions are not satisfied, the representations tend to overfit and fail to generalize on unseen testing tasks.\n\n\nIn light of this, we propose a new approach to Generalizable Task representations Learning\u00a0(GENTLE) to enable effective task recognition in the face of limitations in training task quantity and behavior diversity. GENTLE follows the existing paradigm of OMRL and consists of two interleaving optimization stages: (1) task representation learning and (2) offline meta-policy optimization on top of the learned representations. For (1), we introduce a novel structure, Task Auto-Encoder\u00a0(TAE) to extract representations from the context information. TAE is optimized to reconstruct the state transition and rewards on the probing data rather than contrastive loss, which models the generative structure of the environment and prevents the encoder from overfitting to miscellaneous features when the number of training tasks is limited. To alleviate TAE\u2019s training from overfitting to the behavior policy distribution, we augment the training data via policy, dynamics, and reward relabeling, forcing TAE to learn to exploit the difference in dynamics and rewards rather than input data distributions. For (2), we adopt TD3+BC for its simplicity to optimize a meta-policy with task representations predicted by the TAE.\n\n\nFor evaluations, we compare GENTLE against other baseline algorithms in a set of continuous control tasks with two types of", " \n\nI Introduction\n\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, though they still face significant limitations, especially in domain-specific or knowledge-intensive tasks\u00a0[1], notably producing \u201challucinations\u201d\u00a0[2] when handling queries beyond their training data or requiring current information. To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calculation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applications.\n\n\nFigure 1: Technology tree of RAG research. The stages of involving RAG mainly include pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. With the emergence of LLMs, research on RAG initially focused on leveraging the powerful in context learning abilities of LLMs, primarily concentrating on the inference stage. Subsequent research has delved deeper, gradually integrating more with the fine-tuning of LLMs. Researchers have also been exploring ways to enhance language models in the pre-training stage through retrieval-augmented techniques.\n\n\nRAG technology has rapidly developed in recent years, and the technology tree summarizing related research is shown in Figure\u00a01. The development trajectory of RAG in the era of large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics. Initially, RAG\u2019s inception coincided with the rise of the Transformer architecture, focusing on enhancing language models by incorporating additional knowledge through Pre-Training Models (PTM). This early stage was characterized by foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques[3, 4, 5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT\u00a0[6] marked a pivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context learning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards providing better information for LLMs to answer more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage, leading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research progressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited to the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM fine-tuning techniques.\n\n\nThe burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth, yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that could clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to fill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting its evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the integration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both technical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three main research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and analyzing key technologies in the core stages of \u201cRetrieval,\u201d \u201cGeneration,\u201d and \u201cAugmentation.\u201d On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and summarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper comprehensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this paper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the foundational technical concepts, historical progression, and the spectrum of RAG methodologies and applications that have emerged post-LLMs. It is designed to equip readers and professionals with a detailed and structured understanding of both large models and RAG. It aims to illuminate the evolution of retrieval augmentation techniques, assess the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in their respective contexts, and speculate on upcoming trends and innovations.\n\n\nOur", "Abstract \u2014 Deep reinforcement learning (RL) can enable\nrobots to autonomously acquire complex behaviors, such as\nlegged locomotion. However, RL in the real world is complicated\nby constraints on efficiency, safety, and overall training stability,\nwhich limits its practical applicability. We present APRL, a\npolicy regularization framework that modulates the robot\u2019s\nexploration over the course of training, striking a balance\nbetween flexible improvement potential and focused, efficient\nexploration. APRL enables a quadrupedal robot to efficiently\nlearn to walk entirely in the real world within minutes and\ncontinue to improve with more training where prior work\nsaturates in performance. We demonstrate that continued\ntraining with APRLresults show that APRL is\nsignificantly better equipped than na \u00a8\u0131ve RL to continually\nimprove as it collects more data, as opposed to quickly\nreaching but plateauing with limited capabilities.\nTransferring to different scenarios. We find that APRL not\nonly successfully enables a quadrupedal robot trained only\nin the real world to walk amid a variety of conditions, but\nalso to keep improving as it continues to be deployed. Quan-\ntitatively, the policy learned with APRL even without fine-\ntuning is significantly better on average at walking than the\nRestricted policy in terms of average velocity (see Figure 7)\nand at completing a given path faster and with fewer falls (see\nFigure 8). The exception is when we freeze a joint, in which\ncase the Restricted policy generalizes much better during\nzero-shot evaluation. In this case, we find that with continued\ntraining, APRL can quickly learn to overcome this gap. In\nFigure 5, we show a qualitative comparison of policies where\nthe path can be visualized with a static camera. We encourage\nthe reader to view the qualitative differences in policies for\neach scenario on our project website.\nVI. S IMULATED ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we analyze APRL using a simulated\nversion of the task described in Section III. Although simu-\nlation does not model many of the real-world complexities\nthat we aim to address, we use it to perform controlledexperiments for comparison purposes and insight. We design\nour simulatedmethods can\ncause the networks to lose plasticity, the ability to continue\nlearning with more data, and propose periodic resets of the\nagent to mitigate this effect. Resetting specifically implies\nreinitialization of network weights and optimizer states while\nmaintaining the replay buffer. We incorporate this regularizer\ninto our adaptive strategy as we will describe next.\nIV. E FFICIENT LEARNING OF LEGGED LOCOMOTION\nWITH ADAPTIVE POLICY REGULARIZATION\nWe present our system for efficiently learning and fine-\ntuning quadrupedal locomotion in real-world scenarios using\nAdaptive Policy ReguLarization (APRL). Our framework,\nshown in Figure 2, involves dynamically modulating policy\nregularization over the course of training to provide the\npolicy with adequate room to explore and improve, but not\nso unbridled as to lead to inefficient\u2014and often violent\u2014\ntraining. To do so, we introduce \u2018soft\u2019 constraints on the\nactions (defined in (b)) that are adjusted based on how\n\u2018familiar\u2019 the robot is in its current situation (described in\n(c)). We also incorporate resets to improve plasticity, i.e., the\nability to keep learning from new data. In the remainder of\nthis section, we describe the principle underlying our choice\nof regularization. We then detail how we adapt the constraints\nbased on the robot\u2019s learning progress and finally how we\nimplement them in practice.

Reproducing such natural gait transitions\nhas been a challenging topic in the legged robotic community\ndue to the complexity of multi-legged systems. To produce\nstable gait motions, most methods using only proprioception, in two tests of robust\nand agile locomotion:\n1)Baseline [17]: Our previous work used the teacher-\nstudent training framework and the AMP dataset of\ntrotting gait.\n2)MoB [26]: The policy was trained with more gait\nparameters, which can tune gait behaviors to aid\ngeneralization to different tasks, according to user\u2019s\ncommands.\n1The video is available in https://youtu.be/MoFm6 JVNkoThe two tests are shown in Fig. 5. The robust test is climbing\nstairs with a width of 25 cm and a height of 20 cm , while the\nagile test is sprinting over vegetation with a vcmd\nxof2.5 m/s.\nFig. 5. The robust (left) and agile (right) tests outdoors.\nWe conducted five runs for each test and computed success\nrates. A test was successful if the robot could climb over the\nstairs or sprint out of the vegetation. The result is shown\nin Table V. Since the Baseline was trained using only the\nTABLE V\nOVERALL COMPARISON WITH THREE Methods Multiple gaits Robust test ( %) Agile test ( %)\nBaseline No 40 60\nMoB Yes 0 20\nOurs Yes 100 80\nAMP dataset of trotting gait, it is unable to achieve multiple\ngaits control compared to the MoB and Ours, which were\ntrained with gait parameters and gait-dependent rewards.\nHowever, the Baseline and Ours are more robust and agile\nthan the MoB, as shown in Table V. This can be explained\nby the fact that the MoB was trained on the flat and focused\non the detailed control of gait behaviors, while the others\nwere trained over different terrains and had more flexibilityto lean adaptive behaviors. Although the MoB can tune\ngait details to aid generalization to different tasks, it can\nhardly generalize to challenging terrains by tuning only gait\nparameters. Moreover, Ours has higher success rates than\nthe Baseline when performing robust and agile locomotion.\nThis performance difference is likely due to the different\nlearning frameworks. Ours used the asymmetric actor-critic\nframework, which had smaller sim-to-real gap than the\nBaseline that used the teacher-student framework.\nV. experiments show that our robot can achieve\nmultiple gaits according to user\u2019s commands, while\nachieving robust and agile locomotion.\nII. METHOD\nA. Reinforcement Learning Problem Formulation\nSince the terrains are not fully observable without exte-\nroceptive sensors, our locomotion problem is modeled as a\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The\nenvironment is completely defined by a full state xtat time\nstept. The agent\u2019s policy performs an action at, and then the\nenvironment moves to the next state xt+1with a transition\nprobability P(xt+1|xt,at)and returns a reward rtand a\npartial observation xp\nt+1. The goal of RL is to find a policy\n\u03c0to maximize the expected discounted return over the future\ntrajectory:\nJ(\u03c0) =E\u03c0\"\u221eX\nt=0\u03b3trt#\n, (1)\nwhere \u03b3t\u2208[0,1)is a discount factor.\nRecent works have leveraged the teacher-student training\nparadigm to address the POMDP [11]\u2013[13], [17]. While\nit has been empirically shown that the student policy can\nachieve similar performance to the teacher policy, the student\ncan never outperform the teacher. Moreover, training the\nteacher and student networks sequentially requires more data,\nwhich is sample inefficient.To learn robust blind locomotion in one training phase, we\ntrain our policy using proximal policy optimization (PPO)\n[29], employing", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn The Challenge of Reinforcement Learning, Sutton states: ``Part of the appeal of reinforcement learning is that it is in a sense the whole AI problem in a microcosm'' Sutton (1992). Indeed, the problem facing an agent that learns to make better decisions from experience is at the heart of the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nYet, when we study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem, it is typical to restrict our focus in a number of ways. For instance, we often suppose that a complete description of the state of the environment is available to the agent, or that the interaction stream is subdivided into episodes. Beyond these standard restrictions, however, there is another significant assumption that constrains the usual framing of RL: We tend to concentrate on agents that learn to solve problems, rather than agents that learn forever. For example, consider an agent learning to play Go: Once the agent has discovered how to master the game, the task is complete, and the agent's learning can stop. This view of learning is often embedded in the standard formulation of RL, in which an agent interacts with a Markovian environment with the goal of efficiently identifying an optimal policy, at which point learning can cease.\n\n\nBut what if this is not the best way to model the RL problem? That is, instead of viewing learning as finding a solution, we can instead think of it as endless adaptation. This suggests study of the continual reinforcement learning (CRL) problem Ring (1997, 2005); Khetarpal et\u00a0al. (2022); Kumar et\u00a0al. (2023), as first explored in the thesis by Ring (1994), with close ties to supervised never-ending (Carlson et\u00a0al., 2010; Mitchell et\u00a0al., 2018; Platanios et\u00a0al., 2020) and continual learning (Ring, 1997, 2005; Kirkpatrick et\u00a0al., 2017; Schwarz et\u00a0al., 2018; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2018; Parisi et\u00a0al., 2019; Rolnick et\u00a0al., 2019; Hadsell et\u00a0al., 2020; Lesort et\u00a0al., 2020; Riemer et\u00a0al., 2022; Baker et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nDespite the prominence of CRL, the community lacks a clean, general definition of this problem. It is critical to develop such a definition to promote research on CRL from a clear conceptual foundation, and to guide us in understanding and designing continual learning agents. To these ends, this paper is dedicated to carefully defining the CRL problem. Our definition is summarized as follows:\nThe CRL Problem (Informal)\nAn RL problem is an instance of CRL if the best agents never stop learning.\n\n\nThe core of our definition is framed around two new insights that formalize the notion of ``agents that never stop learning\": (i) we can understand every agent as implicitly searching over a set of history-based policies (Theorem\u00a03.1), and (ii) every agent will either continue this search forever, or eventually stop (Remark\u00a03.2). We make these two insights rigorous through a pair of logical operators on agents that we call generates and reaches that provide a new mathematical language for characterizing agents. Using these tools, we then define CRL as any RL problem in which all of the best agents never stop their implicit search. We provide two motivating examples of CRL, illustrating that traditional multi-task RL and continual supervised learning", "Abstract \u2014 Quadrupedal robots resemble the physical ability\nof legged animals to walk through unstructured terrains.\nHowever, designing a controller for quadrupedal robots poses\na signi\ufb01cant challenge due to their functional complexity\nand requires adaptation to various terrains. Recently, deep\nreinforcement learning, inspired by how legged animals learn\nto walk from their experiences, has been utilized to synthe-\nsize natural quadrupedal locomotion. However, state-of-the-artmethods, as quantitatively veri\ufb01ed by the high survival rate\nand maximum push that it can withstand. The robust perfor-\nmance was achieved through the interplay between accurate\nestimation and robust policy learning of DreamWaQ. More-\nover, the proposed AdaBoot method also increases robustness\nwithout sacri\ufb01cing the base performance.\nIn the real world, DreamWaQ\u2019s policy is robust against\nunstructured terrains. Fig. 6 shows the robot\u2019s foot re\ufb02ex\nwhen faced with foot stumbling and slipping. The robot can\nimmediately adapt its gait and stabilize its pose. Owing to\nthe robust and accurate CENet, the robot had no problem in\nits body velocity estimation and could continue its journey\nwithout any performance deterioration.\nIn Fig. 6(a), the robot exhibits different gaits for going\ndownstairs and upstairs. When going downstairs, the robot\ntends to tilt its body closer to the ground and maintain its\nfront foot far from the body, which is a key gait pattern\nfor quickly \ufb01nding a stable foothold. Meanwhile, the robot\nadapts its gait for going upstairs by signi\ufb01cantly increasing\nits footsteps. This gait is necessary so that the foot can safely\novercome the stairs and \ufb01nd a stable foothold while climbing.\nMoreover, Fig. 6(b) shows the adaptation to slipping, where\nthe robot can immediately detect irregular footholds and\nadapt its gait pattern. Subsequently, the robot tries to recover\nits normal pattern and continues to walk.\nG. Long-Distance Walk\nWe deployed the robot on two challenging outdoor courses\nto demonstrate the robustness of DreamWaQ. Course A was\nan on-campus yard consisting of many slopes and deformable\nterrains. Course B was an on-campus hill with an elevation\ngain of up to 22 m. Courses A and B have a total length of\n430 m and 465 m, respectively. The details of the courses are\nshown in Fig. 7. The robot\u2019s trajectory was measured using a\nreal-time kinematic (RTK) GPS [39] with a frequency of 10\nHz, mounted on top of the robot.

The robot\nalso encountered thick vegetation that trapped the robot\u2019s\nlegs. However, the robot successfully adapted its speed by\nincreasing joint power to overcome the trap.\nThe most challenging part of this course is walking\nthrough stairs and deformable slopes. Thanks to the robust-\nness of the policy and accurate estimation of DreamWaQ,\nthe robot could safely walk through the stairs and slopes.\nWe conducted theresults with the most\nrobust", " Introduction\nRecent works have established that quadruped locomotion controllers trained with reinforcement\nlearning in simulation can successfully be transferred to traverse challenging natural terrains [1, 2,\n6th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2022), Auckland, New Zealand.arXiv:2212.03238v1  [cs.RO]  6 Dec 20223]. Adaptation to diverse terrains is accomplished by estimating terrain properties from sensory\nobservations that are then used by the controller (i.e., online system identi\ufb01cation ). The success of\nthis paradigm relies on two assumptions: a priori modeling of environment parameters that can vary\nduring deployment and the ability to estimate these parameters from sensory observations. To bypass\nthe \ufb01rst assumption, one possibility is to widely vary a large set of environment parameters during\ntraining. However, this creates a hard learning problem due to creation of challenging or infeasible\nlocomotion scenarios. To simplify learning, typically the designer chooses a subset of parameters\nthat are randomized in a carefully restricted range. Even in this setup, additional measures such as a\nlearning curriculum and reward shaping are necessary for successful learning in simulation.\nAs a result of these practical restrictions on the expressiveness of the simulation, quite often the\nrobot encounters scenarios during deployment that were not modeled during training. For instance,\nif the robot is only presented with \ufb02at ground and terrain geometry is not varied during training,\nit may fail to traverse non-\ufb02at terrains such as stairs. In such a case, it is common to tweak the\ntraining environments or the reward functions and re-train the policy. This iterative loop of re-\ntraining and real-world testing is tedious. To make things worse, in some scenarios such iteration is\ninsuf\ufb01cient because it is not possible to accurately model or sense important environment properties.\nFor example, thick bushes are both hard to simulate due to compliance and hard to sense because\ndepth sensors do not distinguish them from walls. Thus, the robot may attempt to climb over thick\nbushes like a rock or move through them with an overly conservative gait that leaves the robot stuck.\nThe examples above illustrate that even for the most advanced sim-to-real systems, the real world\noffers new challenges. We broadly refer to scenarios that can be simulated but are not anticipated\nduring training and the situations which cannot be simulated or identi\ufb01ed from sensory observations\nasout-of-distribution cases. We present a framework for policy learning that enables improved per-\nformance in out-of-distribution scenarios under some assumptions detailed below. Our key insight\nis that given a task, there are multiple equally good solutions (i.e., under-speci\ufb01cation [4]) that have\nequivalent training performance but can generalize in different ways. For instance, the task of walk-\ning on \ufb02at ground only imposes a constraint on the velocity of robot\u2019s body, but not on how the legs\nshould move, or high should the torso be above the ground, etc. Consider two different walking\nbehaviors: crouch where the robot keeps its torso close to the ground and stomp where the torso is\nhigh and also the legs have a high foot swing. While both crouch andstomp succeed at walking on\n\ufb02at ground, their generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios is different: with crouch the robot\ncan traverse under obstacles but not stairs, whereas with stomp it can climb over curbs/stairs but not\nmove under obstacles (Figure 1).\nOut of the many", " Introduction\nOf what use is vision during locomotion? Clearly, there is a role of vision in navigation \u2013 using\nmaps or landmarks to \ufb01nd a trajectory in the 2D plane to a distant goal while avoiding obstacles. But\ngiven a local direction in which to move, it turns out that both humans [ 1] and robots [ 2,3] can do\nremarkably well at blind walking. Where vision becomes necessary is for locomotion in challenging\nterrains. In an urban environment, staircases are the most obvious example. In the outdoors, we can\ndeal with rugged terrain such as scrambling over rocks, or stepping from stone to stone to cross a\nstream of water. There is a fair amount of scienti\ufb01c work studying this human capability and showing\ntight coupling of motor control with vision [ 4,5,6]. In this paper, we will develop this capability for\na quadrupedal walking robot equipped with egocentric depth vision. We use a reinforcement learning\napproach trained in simulation, which we are directly able to transfer to the real world. Figure 1 and\nthe accompanying videos shows some examples of our robot walking guided by vision.\nHumans receive an egocentric stream of vision which is used to control feet placement, typically\nwithout conscious planning. As children we acquire it through trial and error [ 7] but for adults it is an\nautomatized skill. Its unconscious execution should not take away from its remarkable sophistication.\nThe footsteps being placed now are based on information collected some time ago. Typically, we\ndon\u2019t look at the ground underneath our feet, rather at the upcoming piece of ground in front of us\na few steps away[ 1,4,5,6]. A short term memory is being created which persists long enough to\nguide foot placement when we are actually over that piece of ground. Finally, note that we learn to\nwalk through bouts of steps, not by executing pre-programmed gaits [7].\nWe take these observations about human walking as design principles for the visually-based walking\ncontroller for an A1 robot. The walking policy is trained by reinforcement learning with a recurrent\nneural network being used as a short term memory of recent egocentric views, proprioceptive states,\nand action history. Such a policy can maintain memory of recent visual information to retrieve\ncharacteristics of the terrain under the robot or below the rear feet, which might no longer be directly\nvisible in the egocentric view.\nIn contrast, prior locomotion techniques rely on the metric elevation map of the terrain around and\nunder the robot [ 8,9,10] to plan foot steps and joint angles. The elevation map is constructed by\nfusing information from multiple depth images (collected over time). This fusion of depth images\ninto a single elevation map requires the relative pose between cameras at different times. Hence,\ntracking is required in the real world to obtain this relative pose using visual or inertial odometry. This\nis challenging because of noise introduced in sensing and odometry, and hence, previous methods. In ICML , 2018.\n[35] J. Tan, T. Zhang, E. Coumans, A. Iscen, Y . Bai, D. Hafner, S.

Typically, the\nsolution is expected to perform well on all encountered tasks, although various metrics expressing\ndifferent requirements are formulated. The popular CL desiderata include reducing the forgetting on\nprevious tasks and increasing the forward transfer on the new tasks, i.e. speeding up the learning\nby reusing knowledge from previous tasks [ 12,46]. Other desiderata focus on limiting resources,\nsuch as the number of samples, computation time, model size, or additional memory size. These\nrequirements are often con\ufb02icting, so usually some trade-offs have to be made [17, 46, 32].\nCombining CL with RL adds another layer of complexity. In this work, we focus on the SAC\nalgorithm [ 16], which is often considered to be the", " Introduction\nReplay Bu\ufb00er Real World \nActor Critic World Model \nFigure 2: Dreamer follows a simple\npipeline for online learning on robot\nhardware without simulators. The cur-\nrent learned policy collects experience\non the robot. This experience is added\nto the replay buffer. The world model is\ntrained on replayed off-policy sequences\nthrough supervised learning. An actor\ncritic algorithm optimizes a neural net-\nwork policy from imagined rollouts in\nthe latent space of the world model. We\nparallelize data collection and neural net-\nwork learning so learning steps can con-\ntinue while the robot is moving and to\nenable low-latency action computation.Teaching robots to solve complex tasks in the real world\nis a foundational problem of robotics research. Deep re-\ninforcement learning (RL) offers a popular approach to\nrobot learning that enables robots to improve their behavior\nover time through trial and error. However, current algo-\nrithms require too much interaction with the environment\nto learn successful behaviors, making them impractical for\nmany real world tasks. Recently, modern world models\nhave shown great promise for data ef\ufb01cient learning in\nsimulated domains and video games (Hafner et al., 2019;\n2020). Learning world models from past experience en-\nables robots to imagine the future outcomes of potential\nactions, reducing the amount of trial and error in the real\nenvironment needed to learn successful behaviors.\nWhile learning accurate world models can be challenging,\nthey offer compelling properties for robot learning. By\npredicting future outcomes, world models allow for plan-\nning and behavior learning given only small amounts of\nreal world interaction (Gal et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2018).\nMoreover, world models summarize general dynamics\nknowledge about the environment that, once learned, could\nbe reused for a wide range of downstream tasks (Sekar\net al., 2020). World models also learn representations that\nfuse multiple sensor modalities and integrate them into la-\ntent states, removing the need for manual state estimation.\nFinally, world models generalize well from available of-\n\ufb02ine data (Yu et al., 2021), which could further accelerate\nlearning in the real world.\nDespite the promises of world models, learning accurate world models for the real world is a big\nopen challenge. In this paper, we leverage recent advances of the Dreamer world model for training a\nvariety of robots in the most straight-forward and fundamental problem setting: online reinforcement\nlearning in the real world, without simulators or demonstrations. As shown in Figure 2, Dreamer\nlearns a world model from a replay buffer of past experience, learns behaviors from rollouts imagined\nin the latent space of the world model, and continuously interacts with the environment to explore\nand improve its behaviors. Our aim is to push the limits of robot learning directly in the real world\nand offer a robust platform to enable future work that develops the bene\ufb01ts of world models for robot\nlearning. The key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u000fDreamer on Robots We apply Dreamer to 4 robots, demonstrating successful learning directly\nin the real world, without introducing new algorithms.

While such\nrepresentations might emerge from end-to-end training [ 7,79,118,125], prior work has found it\nnecessary to equip RL algorithms with perception-speci\ufb01c loss functions [ 31,43,70,74,89,91,101,\n140] or data augmentations [ 72,74,117,136], effectively decoupling the representation learning\nproblem from the reinforcement learning problem. Given what prior work has shown about RL\nin the presence of function approximation and state aliasing [ 2,134,138], it is not surprising that\nend-to-end learning of representations is fragile [ 72,136]: an algorithm needs good representations\nto drive the learning of the RL algorithm, but the RL algorithm needs to drive the learning of good\nrepresentations. So, can we design RL algorithms that do learn good representations without the\nneed for auxiliary perception losses?\nRather than using a reinforcement learning algorithm also to solve a representation learning problem,\nwe will use a representation learning algorithm to also solve certain types of reinforcement learning\nproblems, namely goal-conditioned RL. Goal-conditioned RL is widely studied [ 6,14,21,62,\n80,119], and intriguing from a representation learning perspective because it can be done in an\nentirely self-supervised manner, without manually-speci\ufb01ed reward functions. We will focus on\ncontrastive (representation) learning results suggest that good performance can be\nachieved without this \ufb01ltering step.\nThis section presents additional \ufb01gures.\n\u2022Fig. 13 compares contrastive RL (NCE) with varying values of the \ufb01ltering parameter \u000f,\ndescribed in Sec. 4.5.\n\u2022Fig. 14 \u2013 This plot shows a TSNE embedding of the state-action representations \u001e(s;a)for\none trajectory of the bin picking task.

Early work in this \ufb01eld focused on developing\napproximate dynamics models of a system and then using tra-\njectory optimization algorithms to solve for the actions that\nlead an agent to achieving a desired goal [1]\u2013[4]. However,\nthe resulting controllers tend to be highly specialized for a\nparticular task, limiting their ability to generalize across more\ndiverse tasks or environments. More recently, there has been\na surge in algorithms that use reinforcement learning (RL)\nto learn locomotion behaviors [5]\u2013[9]. This approach proved\nhighly effective in simulation [10], but this success did not\ntranslate to the real world due to challenges associated with\novercoming the simulation to reality gap.\nOne of the main challenges inhibiting RL approaches\nfrom being more effective in the real world is related to\nthe aggressive and overly-energetic behaviors that are often\nlearned by RL agents trained using under-speci\ufb01ed reward\nfunctions. As an example, a legged RL agent trained with\na reward that encourages forward velocity will often learn\nFig. 1. Training with Adversarial Motion Priors encourages the policy to\nproduce behaviors which capture the essence of the motion capture dataset\nwhile satisfying the auxiliary task objective. Only a small amount of motion\ncapture data is required to train the learning system (4.5 seconds in our experiments).\na control policy that exploits \ufb02ailing of the limbs or high-\nimpulse contacts, and other inaccurate simulator dynamics,\nto achieve forward movement. Such behaviors are unlikely to\nbe effective when transferred to a real robot due to actuator\nlimits and potential damage to the robot. To overcome the\nissues posed by reward under-speci\ufb01cation, researchers have\ninvestigated task-speci\ufb01c action spaces [12], [13], complex\nstyle reward formulations [6]\u2013[8], [14], and curriculum learn-\ning [15], [16]. These approaches achieve state-of-the-artarXiv:2203.15103v1  [cs.AI]  28 Mar 2022Fig. 2.

However, when the robot enters a canter phase the COT exhibits spikes corresponding to the robot pushing off its hind\nlegs and troughs corresponding to the \ufb02ight phase where energy consumption is low. This gait transition phenomenon closely relates to the behavior of\nquadrupedal mammals, which modulate their gait according to their speed of travel, leading to minimal energy consumption consumption [11]. results in\na dramatically different COT pro\ufb01le (Fig. 2:D). While the\npace motion exhibits a fairly constant COT, the canter motion\nproduces large spikes in COT corresponding to the lift-off\nphase and relatively low-valued troughs associated with the\n\ufb02ight and touch-down phase.

A standard and widely\nused approach is to train an end-to-end model from scratch using data from the same domain [ 1].\nHowever, this can be prohibitively data intensive and severely limits generalization. In contrast,\ncomputer vision and natural language processing (NLP) have recently taken a major departure from\nthis \u201ctabula rasa\u201d paradigm. These \ufb01elds have focused on using diverse, large-scale datasets to build\nreusable, pre-trained representations . Such models have become ubiquitous; for example, visual\nrepresentations from ImageNet [ 2] can be reused for tasks like cancer detection [ 3], and pre-trained\nlanguage embeddings like BERT [ 4] have been used for everything from medical coding [ 5] to visual\nquestion answering [ 6]. Such an equivalent of an ImageNet [ 2] or BERT [ 4] model for robotics, that\ncan be readily downloaded and used for any downstream simulation or real-world manipulation task,\nhas remained elusive.\nWhy have we struggled in building this universal representation for robotics? Our conjecture is that\nwe haven\u2019t converged on using the appropriate datasets for robotics. Collecting large and diverse\ndatasets of robots interacting with the physical world can be costly, even without human annotation.\nRecent attempts at creating such datasets [ 7,8,9,10], consist of a limited number of tasks in at\nmost a handful of different environments. This lack of diversity and scale makes it dif\ufb01cult to learn\nrepresentations that are broadly applicable. At the same time, the recent history of computer vision\nand NLP suggests an alternate route for robotics. The best representations in these \ufb01elds did not\narise out of task-speci\ufb01c and carefully curated datasets, but rather the use of abundant in-the-wild\ndata [ 4,11,12,13]. Analogously, for robotics and motor control, we have access to videos of humans\ninteracting in semantically interesting ways with their environments [ 14,15,16]. This data is large\nand diverse, spanning scenes across the globe, and tasks ranging from folding clothes to cooking a\nmeal. While the embodiment present in this data differs from most robots, prior work [ 17,18] has\nfound that such human video data can still be useful for learning reward functions. Furthermore,\ndomain gap has not been a major barrier for using pre-trained representations in traditional vision and\n6th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2022), Auckland, New Zealand.\n\u0003Work completed during internship at Meta AIarXiv:2203.12601v3  [cs.RO]  18 Nov 2022Ego4D Video + Language\n\u201cstirs the snacks\u2026\u201dTime Contrastive LearningVideo-Language Alignment\n\u201cremoves the battery\u2026\u201d\nPre-Trained R3M RepresentationEfficient Robot Learning New Environment, New T asks\nL1 Sparsity Penalty\ntimeFigure 1: Pre-Training Reusable Representations for Robot Manipulation (R3M) : We pre-train a visual\nrepresentation using diverse human video datasets like Ego4D [ 16], and study its effectiveness for downstream\nrobot manipulation tasks.

In this backdrop, we ask the pertinent question: can visual representations pre-trained on\ndiverse human videos enable ef\ufb01cient downstream learning of robotic manipulation skills?\nWe hypothesize that a good representation for vision-based robotic manipulation consists of three\ncomponents. First, it should contain information necessary for physical interaction, and thus should\ncapture the temporal", "Abstract \u2014 Legged robots are physically capable of travers-\ning a wide range of challenging environments, but designing\ncontrollers that are suf\ufb01ciently robust to handle this diversity\nhas been a long-standing challenge in robotics. Reinforcement\nlearning presents an appealing approach for automating the\ncontroller design process and has been able to produce re-\nmarkably robust controllers when trained in a suitable range\nof environments. However, it is dif\ufb01cult to predict all likely\nconditions the robot will encounter during deployment and\nenumerate them at training-time. What if instead of training\ncontrollers that are robust enough to handle any eventuality,\nwe enable the robot to continually learn in any setting it\n\ufb01nds itself in? This kind of real-world reinforcement learning\nposes a number of challenges, including ef\ufb01ciency, safety, and\nautonomy. To address these challenges, we propose a practical\nrobot reinforcement learning system for \ufb01ne-tuning locomotion\npolicies in the real world.

However, fully\nrealizing this capability requires controllers that can effec-\ntively handle this broad range of environments. Engineering\nsuch robust controllers for each robot is a labor-intensive\nprocess, requiring human expertise and precise modeling of\nthe system dynamics [3]\u2013[5]. Reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithms have been used to automatically learn robotic\nlocomotion skills in a wide range of contexts, both in\nsimulation and in the real world [6]\u2013[17]. However, in order\n1https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/\nfine-tuning-locomotionfor thesemethods suffer be-\ncause they assume that a pre-trained encoder or latent space\ncan generalize, which is too strong an assumption when\nthe test environment differs suf\ufb01ciently from the training\nenvironments. RMA especially suffers in this case because it\nrelies entirely on the pre-trained encoder to adapt, and when\nthis encoder fails to generalize, it does not have any other\nrecourse. The latent space method does adapt, but it relies\non the latent space already containing suitable strategies for\nthe new environment and ends up with a suboptimal policy.\nIn contrast, our \ufb01netuning approach is able to continuously\nimprove and eventually succeed.

Tasks such as\nlegged locomotion [1], manipulation [2], and navigation [3], have been solved using these new\ntools, and research continues to keep adding more and more challenging tasks to the list. The\namount of data required to train a policy increases with the task complexity. For this reason, most\nwork focuses on training in simulation before transferring to real robots. We have reached a point\nwhere multiple days or even weeks are needed to fully train an agent with current simulators. For\nexample, OpenAI\u2019s block reorientation task was trained for up to 14 days and their Rubik\u2019s cube\nsolving policy took several months to train [4]. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that deeparXiv:2109.11978v3  [cs.RO]  19 Aug 2022reinforcement learning requires hyper-parameter tuning to obtain a suitable solution which requires\nsequentially rerunning time-consuming training. Reducing training times using massively parallel\napproaches such as presented here can therefore help improve the quality and time-to-deployment\nof DRL policies, as a training setup can be iterated on more often in the same time frame.\nIn this paper, we examine the effects of massive parallelism for on-policy DRL algorithms and\npresent considerations in how the standard RL formulation and the most commonly used hyper-\nparameters should be adapted to learn ef\ufb01ciently in the highly parallel regime. Additionally, we\npresent a novel game-inspired curriculum which automatically adapts the task dif\ufb01culty to the per-\nformance of the policy. The proposed curriculum architecture is straightforward to implement, does\nnot require tuning, and is well suited for the massively parallel regime. Common robotic simulators\nsuch as Mujoco [5], Bullet [6], or Raisim [7] feature ef\ufb01cient multi-body dynamics implementations.\nHowever, they have been developed to run on CPUs with only a reduced amount of parallelism. In\nthis work, we use NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac Gym simulation environment [8], which runs both the simulation\nand training on the GPU and is capable of simulating thousands of robots in parallel.\nThe massively parallel training regime has been explored before [4, 9] in the context of distributed\nsystems with a network of thousands of CPUs each running a separate instance of the simulation.\nThe parallelization was achieved by averaging the gradients between the different workers without\nreducing the number of samples provided by each agent. This results for both \ufb02at and rough terrain tasks. We see that the critic loss is higher\nwithout bootstrapping, and correspondingly, the total reward is lower. Even though learning can be\nsuccessful without this addition, it greatly reduces the critic loss and improves the total reward by\napproximately 10 % to20 % for both tasks.\n(a) Flat Terrain\n(b) Rough Terrain\nFigure 10: Comparison of total reward and critic loss, when training with and without reward boot-\nstrapping on time-outs.\n12A.3 Reward Terms\nJoint positions qj\nJoint velocities _qj\nJoint accelerations \u007fqj\nTarget joint positions \u007fq\u0003\nj\nJoint torques \u001cj\nBase linear velocity vb\nBase angular velocity !b\nCommanded base linear velocity v\u0003\nb\nCommanded base angular velocity !\u0003\nb\nNumber of collisions nc\nFeet air time tair\nEnvironment time step dt\nTable 1: De\ufb01nition of symbols.\nde\ufb01nition weight\nLinear velocity tracking \u001e(v\u0003\nb;xy\u0000vb;xy) 1dt\nAngular velocity tracking \u001e(!\u0003\nb;z\u0000!b;z) 0:5dt\nLinear velocity penalty \u0000v2\nb;z 4dt\nAngular velocity penalty \u0000jj!b;xyjj20:05dt\nJoint motion\u0000jj\u007fqjjj2\u0000jj_qjjj20:001dt\nJoint torques \u0000jj\u001cjjj20:00002dt\nAction rate \u0000jj_q\u0003\njjj20:25dt\nCollisions\u0000ncollision 0:001dt\nFeet air timeP4\nf=0(tair;f\u00000:5) 2dt\nTable 2: De\ufb01nition of reward terms, with \u001e(x) := exp(\u0000jjxjj2\n0:25).

Deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has achieved superhuman performance in very\nchallenging tasks, ranging from classic strategy games such as Go and Chess [ 1], to real-time\ncomputer games like StarCraft [ 2] and DOTA [ 3]. It has also shown impressive Background\n2.1 Parallelization Strategy\nThere are many approaches to parallelizing physics simulations. We outline these approaches here\nand justify our design decisions in the context of GPU-accelerated simulation tailored towards\nlearning algorithms. Isaac Gym was developed to maximize the throughput of physics-based machine\nlearning algorithms with particular emphasis on simulations that require large numbers of environment\ninstances executing in parallel.\n2.1.1 CPU Simulations\nWhen physics simulation runs on CPU, multiple threads can be used to distribute computation among\nthe available cores. The most straightforward strategy is simulating one environment instance per\nthread. In this approach, scaling is limited by the number of physical cores in the system. On a\n64-core hyper-threaded CPU, we could run up to 128 environments in parallel, but CPUs with a large\nnumber of cores are typically clocked lower to prevent overheating. Running tens or hundreds of\nthreads comes with other potential pitfalls including synchronization, context-switching overhead,\nand memory bandwidth limitations. To scale further, we would need to use a multi-CPU setup or\nbuild a cluster, which introduces additional communication overhead.\nRunning a single environment instance per thread in its own dedicated physics scene can be inef\ufb01cient.\nThere is some overhead involved in setting up, executing, and gathering the Appendix A.2.3.\nThe observations are also identical, save for the change in number of \ufb01ngers.\nA.3 Hyperparameters for Training PPO\nEnvironment # Environments KL Threshold Mini-batch Size Horizon Length # PPO Epochs Hidden Units Training Steps\nAnt 4096 8e-3 32768 16 4 256, 128, 64 32M\nHumanoid 4096 8e-3 32768 32 5 400, 200, 100 327M\nIngenuity 4096 1.6 e-2 32768 16 8 256, 256, 128 32M\nANYmal 8192 1e-2 32768 16 5 256, 128, 64 65M\nANYmal Terrain 4096 1e-2 24576 24 10 512, 256, 128 150M\nAMP 4096 2e-1 16384 32 8 1024, 512 39M\nFranka 16384 1.6 e-2 131072 32 4 256, 128, 64 786M\nSH Standard 16384 1.6 e-2 32768 8 5 512, 512, 256, 128 655M\nSH OpenAI FF 16384 1.6 e-2 32768 8 5 400, 400, 200, 100 655M\nSH OpenAI LSTM 8192 1.6 e-2 32768 16 4 lstm: 1024, mlp: 512 925M\nTable 17: Hyperparameters used for training in each environment.

However,\nsuch policies are dif\ufb01cult to transfer to the real world [ 31,39,6].\nOne approach is to directly train in the real world [ 18,55].\nHowever, such policies are limited to very simple setups, and\nscaling to complex setups requires unsafe exploration and a\nlarge number of samples.\nSim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning To achieve complex\nwalking behaviours in the real world using RL, severalAbstract \u2014Successful real-world deployment of legged robots\nwould require them to adapt in real-time to unseen scenarios\nlike changing terrains, changing payloads, wear and tear. This\npaper presents Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) algorithm to\nsolve this problem of real-time online adaptation in quadruped\nrobots. RMA consists of two components: a base policy and an\nadaptation module. The combination of these components enables\nthe robot to adapt to novel situations in fractions of a second.\nRMA is trained completely in simulation without using any\ndomain knowledge like reference trajectories or prede\ufb01ned foot\ntrajectory generators and is deployed on the A1 robot without\nany \ufb01ne-tuning. We train RMA on a varied terrain generator\nusing bioenergetics-inspired rewards and deploy it on a variety of\ndif\ufb01cult terrains including rocky, slippery, deformable surfaces\nin environments with grass, long vegetation, concrete, pebbles,\nstairs, sand, etc. RMA shows state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse real-world as well as simulationexperiments in Figure 4 of the\nmain paper, we also analyze the gait patterns and the torque\npro\ufb01le for the mass adaptation case, shown in Figure S3.

Given the diversity of successful applications of such models, we seek to\nexamine their application to sequential decision making problems formalized as reinforcement\nlearning (RL). In contrast to prior work using transformers as an architectural choice for components\nwithin traditional RL algorithms [ 4,5], we seek to study if generative trajectory modeling \u2013 i.e.\nmodeling the joint distribution of the sequence of states, actions, and rewards \u2013 can serve as a\nreplacement for conventional RL algorithms.\nWe consider the following shift in paradigm: instead of training a policy through conventional\nRL algorithms like temporal difference (TD) learning [ 6], we will train transformer models on\ncollected experience using a sequence modeling objective. This will allow us to bypass the need for\nbootstrapping for long term credit assignment \u2013 thereby avoiding one of the \u201cdeadly triad\u201d [ 6] known\nto destabilize RL. It also avoids the need for discounting future rewards, as typically done in TD\nlearning, which can induce undesirable short-sighted behaviors. Additionally, we can make use of\nexisting transformer frameworks widely used in language and vision that are easy to scale, utilizing a\nlarge body of work studying stable training of transformer models.\nIn addition to their demonstrated ability to model long sequences, transformers also have other\nadvantages. Transformers can perform credit assignment directly via self-attention, in contrast to\nBellman backups which slowly propagate rewards and are prone to \u201cdistractor\u201d signals [ 7]. This can\nenable transformers to still work effectively in the presence of sparse or distracting rewards. Finally,\nempirical evidence suggest that a transformer modeling approach can model a wide distribution of\nbehaviors, enabling better generalization and transfer [3].\nWe explore our hypothesis by considering of\ufb02ine RL, where we will task agents with learning policies\nfrom suboptimal data \u2013 producing maximally effective behavior from \ufb01xed, limited experience. This\ntask is traditionally challenging due to error propagation and value overestimation [ 8]. However, it is\na natural task when training with a sequence modeling objective. By training an autoregressive model\non sequences of states, actions, and returns, we reduce policy sampling to autoregressive generative\nmodeling. We can specify the expertise of the policy \u2013 which \u201cskill\u201d to query \u2013 by selecting the\ndesired return tokens, acting as a prompt for generation.\nIllustrative example. To get an intuition for our proposal, consider the task of \ufb01nding the shortest\npath on a directed graph, which can be posed as an RL problem. The reward is 0when the agent is\nat the goal node and \u00001otherwise. We train a GPT [ 9] model to predict next token in a sequence\nof returns-to-go (sum of future rewards), states, and actions. Training only on random walk data \u2013\nwith no expert demonstrations \u2013 we can generate optimal trajectories at test time by adding a prior\nto generate highest possible returns (see more details and empirical Discussion\n5.1 Does Decision Transformer perform behavior cloning on a subset of the data?\nIn this section, we seek to gain insight into whether Decision Transformer can be thought of as\nperforming imitation learning on a subset of the data with a certain return. To investigate", " Introduction\nIn this supplementary material, we list some detailed re-\nsults of our paper including: (1)The proof of monotonicity\nof entropy with respect to temperature coeffecient \u03c4.(2)\nAll numerical methods and the corresponding forms of mutual informa-\ntion. Wang et al [31] try to understand the contrastive learn-\ning by two key properties, the alignment and uniformity.\nDifferent from the above works, we focus mainly on the\ninherent properties of the contrastive loss function. We em-\nphasize the signi\ufb01cance of the temperature \u03c4, and use it as a\nproxy to analyze some intriguing phenomenons of the con-\ntrastive learning.\n3. Hardness-aware Property\nGiven an unlabeled training set X={x1,...,xN}, the\ncontrastive loss is formulated as:\nL(xi) =\u2212log/bracketleftBigg\nexp(si,i/\u03c4)/summationtext\nk/negationslash=iexp(si,k/\u03c4) + exp(si,i/\u03c4)/bracketrightBigg\n(1)\nwheresi,j=f(xi)Tg(xj).f(\u00b7)is a feature extractor which\nmaps the images from pixel space to a hypersphere space.\ng(\u00b7)is a function which can be same as f[4], or comes from\na memory bank [33], momentum queue [10], etc. For con-\nvenience, we de\ufb01ne the probability of xibeing recognized\nasxjas:\nPi,j=exp(si,j/\u03c4)/summationtext\nk/negationslash=iexp(si,k/\u03c4) + exp(si,i/\u03c4)(2)\nThe contrastive loss tries to make the positive pairs at-\ntracted and the negative samples separated, i.e., the positive\nalignment and negative separation. This objective can also\nbe achieved by using a more simple contrastive loss as:\nLsimple (xi) =\u2212si,i+\u03bb/summationdisplay\ni/negationslash=jsi,j (3)\nHowever, we \ufb01nd that the above loss function performs\nmuch worse than the softmax-based contrastive loss of Eq\n1.0\n 0.5\n 0.0 0.5 1.0050\u00d7103\n = 0.07\n = 0.20\n = 0.30\n = 1.00\nFigure 3.

As we can\nsee, with lower temperature, the contrastive loss tends to punish\nmore on the hard negative samples.\n1. In the following parts, we will show that different with\nLsimple , the softmax-based contrastive loss is a hardness-\naware loss function, which automatically concentrates on\nseparating more informative negative samples to make the\nembedding distribution more uniform. Besides, we also \ufb01nd\nthat theLsimple is a special case by approaching the temper-\nature\u03c4to+\u221e. Next, we will start with a gradient analysis\nto explain the properties of the contrastive loss.\n3.1. Gradients Analysis.\nWe analyze the gradients with respect to positive sam-\nples and different negative samples. We will show that the\nmagnitude of positive gradient is equal to the sum of nega-\ntive gradients. The temperature controls the distribution of\nnegative gradients. Smaller temperature tends to concen-\ntrate more on the nearest neighbours of the anchor point,\nwhich plays a role in controlling the hardness-aware sensi-\ntivity. Speci\ufb01cally, the gradients with respect to the positive\nsimilaritysi,iand the negative similarity si,j(j/negationslash=i) are\nformulated as:\n\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,i=\u22121\n\u03c4/summationdisplay\nk/negationslash=iPi,k,\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,j=1\n\u03c4Pi,j (4)\nFrom Eq 4, we have the following observations: (1) The\ngradients with respect to negative samples is proportional\nto the exponential term exp(si,j/\u03c4), indicating that the con-\ntrastive loss is a hardness-aware loss function, which is dif-\nferent with the loss of Eq 3 that gives all negative similar-\nities the same magnitude of gradients. (2) The magnitude\nof gradient with respect to positive sample is equal to the\nsum of gradients with respect to all negative samples, i.e.,\n(/summationtext\nk/negationslash=i|\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,k|)/|\u2202L(xi)\n\u2202si,i|= 1, which can de\ufb01ne a proba-\nbilistic distribution to help understand the role of tempera-\nture\u03c4.\n3.2. The Role of temperature\nThe temperature plays a role in controlling the strength\nof penalties on hard negative samples.

We have:\nri(si,j) =exp(si,j/\u03c4)/summationtext\nk/negationslash=iexp(si,k/\u03c4), i/negationslash=j (5)\nwhich obeys the Boltzman distribution.

Their applications include sig-\nnature [4] and face [34] veri\ufb01cation, tracking [3], one-shot\nlearning [23], and others. In conventional use cases, the in-\nputs to Siamese networks are from different images, and the\ncomparability is determined by supervision.\nContrastive learning. The core idea of contrastive learn-\ning [16] is to attract the positive sample pairs and repulse the\nnegative sample pairs. This methodology has been recently\npopularized for un-/self-supervised representation learning\n[36, 30, 20, 37, 21, 2, 35, 17, 29, 8, 9]. Simple and effective\ninstantiations of contrastive learning have been developed\nusing Siamese networks [37, 2, 17, 8, 9].\nIn practice, contrastive learning Discussion\nOur hypothesis is about what the optimization problem\ncan be. It does not explain why collapsing is prevented.\nWe point out that SimSiam and its variants\u2019 non-collapsing\nbehavior still remains as an empirical observation.\nHere we brie\ufb02y discuss our understanding on this open\nquestion. The alternating optimization provides a different\ntrajectory, and the trajectory depends on the initialization.\nIt is unlikely that the initialized \u0011, which is the output of a\nrandomly initialized network, would be a constant. Starting\nfrom this initialization, it may be dif\ufb01cult for the alternating\noptimizer to approach a constant \u0011xfor allx, because the\nmethod does notcompute the gradients w.r.t. \u0011jointly for\nallx. The optimizer seeks another trajectory (Figure 2 left),\nin which the outputs are scattered (Figure 2 middle).\n6. Comparisons\n6.1. Result Comparisons\nImageNet.

Blue indicates policies that perform similarly to the corresponding policy with default settings. Green and red\nindicate policies that perform better or worse than the default, respectively. Policies without velocity feedback or with\nkp= 160 all fail the sim-to-real tests. They also generally perform worse in the robustness tests compared to default.\nA. Dynamics Randomization Produces Conservative Policies\nWe observe in TABLE III that dynamics randomization\ncan sometimes lead to policies that are overly-conservative\nin order to achieve unnecessary robustness in parameters\nthat are being randomized. For example, the pacing policies\ntrained with no velocity feedback and dynamics randomiza-\ntion perform worse than policies trained without dynamics\nrandomization in general, except in terms of dealing with\nlatency. However, the physical robot system has an estimated\nlatency of less than 4 ms, and this unnecessary robustness\nagainst increased latency leads to compromised performance\nand robustness along other dimensions.\nWe further train trotting policies under the default setting\nwith dynamics randomization. We observe a more con-\nservative maximum speed (0.9 m/s with randomization and\n1.1 m/s with no randomization), both in simulation and on\nthe physical robot. This also corresponds to our intuition that\ndynamics randomization can produce conservative policies.\nB. Randomize Parameters that Matter\nWe use the latency test to investigate the usefulness of\ndynamics randomization. We observe that policies trained\nwithout randomization fail when the latency exceeds 17 ms.\nWe train another policy with randomized latency only; more\nspeci\ufb01cally, the policy is trained with randomized latency of\nup to 20 ms. The resulting policy can handle latency up to\n32 ms, both in simulation and on the physical robot.\nThis indicates that dynamics randomization can help in\nscenarios where signi\ufb01cant modeling errors are present, such\nas latency in the system. In these scenarios, dynamics ran-\ndomization provides a useful mechanism to cross the reality\ngap by only randomizing the parameters that are responsible.\nC. Summary\nWe observe that blindly applying dynamics randomization\nwhen it is not necessary can generate suboptimal policies that\nare too conservative. However, if the system has fundamental\nmodeling errors that hinder sim-to-real success, randomiza-\ntion is needed to cross the reality gap, as shown in our latencyexperiments. We note that actuator modeling errors can also\npose a sim-to-real challenge, as noted in [4], where a learned\nactuator model is employed to cross the reality gap.\nIn summary, we suggest employing dynamic randomiza-\ntion or additional modeling only when signi\ufb01cant modeling\nerrors are present and to only randomize or model parametersthat matter. Super\ufb02uous dynamics randomization harms", " INTRODUCTION\nLegged locomotion can dramatically expand the reach of robotics.\nMuch of the dry landmass on Earth remains impassible to wheeled and\ntracked machines, the stability of which can be severely compromised\non challenging terrain. Quadrupedal animals, on the other hand, can\naccess some of the most remote parts of our planet. They can choose\nsafe footholds within their kinematic reach and rapidly change their\nkinematic state in response to the environment. Legged robots have the\npotential to traverse any terrain that their animal counterparts can.\nTo date, no published work has demonstrated dynamic locomotion\nin diverse, challenging natural environments as shown in Fig. 1. These\nenvironments have highly irregular pro\ufb01les, deformable terrain, slip-\npery surfaces, and overground obstructions. Under such conditions,\nexisting published controllers manifest frequent foot slippage, loss of\nbalance, and ultimately catastrophic failure. The challenge is exacer-\nbated by the inaccessibility of veridical information about the physical\nproperties of the terrain. Exteroceptive sensors such as cameras and\nLiDAR cannot reliably measure physical characteristics such as friction\nand compliance, are impeded by obstructions such as vegetation, snow,\nand water, and may not have the coverage and temporal resolution to\ncapture changes induced by the robot itself, such as the crumbling of\nloose ground under the robot\u2019s feet. Under these conditions, the robot\nmust rely crucially on proprioception \u2013 the sensing of its own bodilycon\ufb01guration at high temporal resolution. In response to unforeseen\nevents such as unexpected ground contact, terrain deformation, and\nfoot slippage, the controller must rapidly produce whole-body trajecto-\nries subject to multiple objectives: balancing, avoiding self-collision,\ncounteracting external disturbances, and locomotion. While animals\ninstinctively solve this complex control problem, it is an open challenge\nin robotics.\nConventional approaches to legged locomotion on uneven terrain\nhave yielded increasingly complex control architectures. Many rely\non elaborate state machines that coordinate the execution of motion\nprimitives and re\ufb02ex controllers [ 1\u20135]. To trigger transitions between\nstates or the execution of a re\ufb02ex, many systems explicitly estimate\nstates such as ground contact and slippage [ 6\u20138]. Such estimation\nis commonly based on empirically tuned thresholds and can become\nerratic in the presence of unmodeled factors such as mud, snow, or\nvegetation. Other systems employ contact sensors at the feet, which\ncan become unreliable in \ufb01eld conditions [ 9\u201311]. Overall, conventional\nsystems for legged locomotion on rough terrain escalate in complexity\nas more scenarios are taken into account, have become extremely\nlaborious to develop and maintain, and remain vulnerable to corner\ncases.\nModel-free reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as\nan alternative approach in the development of legged locomotion\nskills [ 12\u201314]. The idea of RL is to tune a controller to optimize aarXiv:2010.11251v1  [cs.RO]  21 Oct 2020Research Article ETH Zurich and Intel 2\nFig. 1.

The optimization is performed on data acquired\nby executing the controller itself, which improves with experience.\nRL has been used to simplify the design of locomotion controllers,\nautomate parts of the design process, and learn behaviors that could\nnot be engineered with prior approaches [12\u201315].\nHowever, application of RL to legged locomotion has largely been\ncon\ufb01ned to laboratory environments and conditions.

While it is obvious\nthat some criteria for usefulness depend on the task, it is also\nuniversally assumed that there are sets of features that are\nrepresentative of a dataset and that are generally useful as\ninput for many kinds of downstream classi\u001cer or predictor.\nFocusing explicitly on learning representation in some cases\ncan be bene\u001ccial, for example, when a labelled dataset for\na task is small and we want to leverage a larger unlabelled\ndataset to improve the performance of a learning system.\nRepresentation learning refers to the process of learning\na parametric mapping from the raw input data domain to\na feature vector or tensor, in the hope of capturing and\nextracting more abstract\nstate representation. The graph Neural network heads then\ntransform the state's representations and its corresponding\nactions (represented as one-hot vectors) into the state repre-\nsentation in the next time step. Similar to TransE, the statetransitions between time steps is modeled as a translation in\nthe embedding space and the entire world model is trained\nend-to-end with an energy-based hinge loss.\nFocusing on learning useful node representations from\ngeneral graphs, node2vec [35] aims to learn a node repre-\nsentation that is similar between neighbour nodes. The key\ncontribution of node2vec is a family of biased random walk introduction of the Skip-gram and CBOW algo-\nrithms [68] to learn word representations which depend heav-\nily on the tree structure of the hierarchical softmax, Mnih andKavukcuoglu [70] used NCE to avoid having to compute the\nnormalisation term of the softmax. Also inspired by NCE,\nMikolov et al. [67] proposed a slightly different method\ncalled Negative Sampling (NEG) that focuses solely on learn-\ning good word representations with the trade-off of losing the\nprobabilistic properties from NCE.\nRecently, the Bidirectional Encoder Representation\nfrom Transformer (BERT) [24] model learns bidirectional\nword representations using the Transformer architecture's\ndecoder [103] and demonstrated great performance for trans-\nfer learning in multiple downstream tasks. XLNet [116] mod-\ni\u001ced BERT's masked language model objective to include\nan autoregressive objective. While these language model\nobjectives are usually referred to as a form of denoising\nautoencoder that try to reconstruct the original input, in the\ncase of learning word embeddings which is just a lookup\nlayer from index to vector, there is no difference between\nreconstructing and contrasting between feature vectors and\nthus this work does fall under the remit of being a form of\ncontrastive learning.\nUnder the mutual information maximisation framework,\nKong et al. [61] showed that BERT or XLnet also maximise\nglobal-local mutual information, whereas the next sentence\nprediction pre-training task can be seen as constructing simi-\nlarity pairs using the sequential coherence property. With this\ninsight, Kong et al. [61] also proposed BERT-NCE, a variant\nof BERT that uses an NCE-based loss instead of the full\nVOLUME 8, 2020 15P. H.

On Bonus Based Exploration", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is an effective framework to solve sequential decision-making tasks, where a learning agent interacts with the environment to improve its performance through trial and error\u00a0[1].\nOriginated from cybernetics and thriving in computer science, RL has been widely applied to tackle challenging tasks which were previously intractable.\nTraditional RL algorithms were mostly designed for tabular cases, which provide principled solutions to simple tasks but face difficulties when handling highly complex domains, e.g.\u00a0tasks with 3D environments.\nWith the recent advances in deep learning research, the combination of RL and deep neural networks is developed to address challenging tasks.\nThe combination of deep learning with RL is hence referred to as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\u00a0[2], which learns powerful function approximators using deep neural networks to address complicated domains.\nDRL has achieved notable success in applications such as robotics control\u00a0[3, 4] and game playing\u00a0[5].\nIt also thrives in domains such as health informatics\u00a0[6], electricity networks\u00a0[7], intelligent transportation systems[8, 9], to name just a few.\n\n\nBesides its remarkable advancement, RL still faces intriguing difficulties\ninduced by the exploration-exploitation dilemma\u00a0[1].\nSpecifically, for practical RL problems, the environment dynamics are usually unknown, and the agent cannot exploit knowledge about the environment until enough interaction experiences are collected via exploration.\nDue to the partial observability, sparse feedbacks, and the high complexity of state and action spaces, acquiring sufficient interaction samples can be prohibitive or even incur safety concerns for domains such as automatic-driving and health informatics.\nThe abovementioned challenges have motivated various efforts to improve the current RL procedure.\nAs a result, transfer learning (TL), or equivalently referred as knowledge transfer, which is a technique to utilize external expertise to benefit the learning process of the target domain, becomes a crucial topic in RL.\n\n\nWhile TL techniques have been extensively studied in supervised learning\u00a0[10], it is still an emerging topic for RL.\nTransfer learning can be more complicated for RL, in that the knowledge needs to transfer in the context of a Markov Decision Process.\nMoreover, due to the delicate components of the Markov decision process, expert knowledge may take different forms that need to transfer in different ways.\n\nNoticing that previous efforts on summarizing TL in the RL domain did not cover research of the last decade\u00a0[11, 12], during which time considerate TL breakthroughs have been achieved empowered with deep learning techniques.\nHence, in this survey, we make a comprehensive investigation of the latest TL approaches in RL.\n\n\n\nThe contributions of our survey are multifold:\n1) we investigated up-to-date research involving new DRL backbones and TL algorithms over the recent decade.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first attempt to survey TL approaches in the context of deep reinforcement learning.\nWe reviewed TL methods that can tackle more evolved RL tasks,\nand also studied new TL schemes that are not deeply discussed by prior literatures, such as representation disentanglement\u00a0(Sec 5.5) and policy distillation (Sec 5.3).\n2) We provided systematic categorizations that cover a broader and deeper view of TL developments in DRL.\nOur main analysis is anchored on a fundamental question, i.e.\u00a0what is the transferred knowledge in RL, following which we conducted more refined analysis.\nMost TL strategies, including those discussed in prior surveys are", " Introduction\nEver since the \ufb01rst fully-learned approach succeeded at\nplaying Atari games from screen images (Mnih et al., 2015),\nstandard practice in deep reinforcement learning (RL) has\nbeen to learn visual features and a control policy jointly,\nend-to-end. Several such deep RL algorithms have matured\n(Hessel et al., 2018; Schulman et al., 2017; Mnih et al., 2016;\n1University of California, Berkeley.

Copyright 2021 by the author(s).Haarnoja et al., 2018) and have been successfully applied\nto domains ranging from real-world (Levine et al., 2016;\nKalashnikov et al., 2018) and simulated robotics (Lee et al.,\n2019; Laskin et al., 2020a; Hafner et al., 2020) to sophis-\nticated video games (Berner et al., 2019; Jaderberg et al.,\n2019), and even high-\ufb01delity driving simulators (Dosovit-\nskiy et al., 2017). While the simplicity of end-to-end meth-\nods is appealing, relying on the reward function to learn\nvisual features can be severely limiting. For example, it\nleaves features dif\ufb01cult to acquire under sparse rewards, and\nit can narrow their utility to a single task. Although our\nintent is broader than to focus on either sparse-reward or\nmulti-task settings, they arise naturally in our studies. We\ninvestigate how to learn visual representations which are\nagnostic to rewards, without degrading the control policy.\nA number of recent works have signi\ufb01cantly improved RL\nperformance by introducing auxiliary losses, which are un-\nsupervised tasks that provide feature-learning signal to the\nconvolution neural network (CNN) encoder, additionally\nto the RL loss (Jaderberg et al., 2017; van den Oord et al.,\n2018; Laskin et al., 2020b; Guo et al., 2020; Schwarzer\net al., 2020). Meanwhile, in the \ufb01eld of computer vision,\nrecent efforts in unsupervised and self-supervised learning\n(Chen et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; He et al., 2019) have\ndemonstrated that powerful feature extractors can be learned\nwithout labels, as evidenced by their usefulness for down-\nstream tasks such as ImageNet classi\ufb01cation. Together,\nthese advances suggest that visual features for RL could\npossibly be learned entirely without rewards, which would\ngrant greater \ufb02exibility to improve overall learning perfor-\nmance. To our knowledge, however, no single unsupervised\nlearning (UL) task has been shown adequate for this purpose\nin general vision-based environments.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the \ufb01rst decoupling of rep-\nresentation learning from reinforcement learning that per-\nforms as well as or better than end-to-end RL. We update\nthe encoder weights using only UL and train a control policy\nindependently, on the (compressed) latent images. This ca-\npability stands in contrast to previous state-of-the-art meth-\nods, which have trained the UL and RL objectives jointly,\nor (Laskin et al., 2020b), which observed diminished perfor-\nmance with decoupled encoders.\nOur main enabling contribution is a new unsupervised taskarXiv:2009.08319v3  [cs.LG]  16 May 2021Decoupling Representation Learning from Reinforcement Learning\ntailored to reinforcement learning, which we call Aug-\nmented Temporal Contrast (ATC). ATC requires a model\nto associate observations from nearby time steps within the\nsame trajectory (Anand et al., 2019). Observations are en-\ncoded via a convolutional neural network (shared with the\nRL agent) into a small latent space, where the InfoNCE\nloss is applied (van den Oord et al., 2018). Within each\nrandomly sampled training batch, the positive observation,\not+k, for every anchor, ot, serves as negative for all other\nanchors. For regularization, observations undergo stochastic\ndata augmentation (Laskin et al., 2020b) prior", " Introduction\nFigure 1: Our SupCon loss consistently outper-\nforms cross-entropy with standard data augmenta-\ntions. We show top-1 accuracy for the ImageNet\ndataset, on ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and ResNet-\n200, and compare against AutoAugment [5], Ran-\ndAugment [6] and CutMix [60].The cross-entropy loss is the most widely used loss\nfunction for supervised learning of deep classi\ufb01ca-\ntion models. A number of works have explored\nshortcomings of this loss, such as lack of robustness\nto noisy labels [64, 46] and the possibility of poor\nmargins [10, 31], leading to reduced generalization\nperformance. However, in practice, most proposed\nalternatives have not worked better for large-scale\ndatasets, such as ImageNet [7], as evidenced by the\ncontinued use of cross-entropy to achieve state of the\nart results for more optimizers and data augmentation strategies. Added SupCon loss\nhierarchy. Adjusted table reporting for clarity.\nVersion 3 (2020-10-13) Removed deprecated sentence from Related Work\nOur work draws on existing literature in self-supervised representation learning, metric learning\nand supervised learning. Here we focus on the most relevant papers. The cross-entropy loss was\nintroduced as a powerful loss function to train deep networks [40, 1, 29]. The key idea is simple\nand intuitive: each class is assigned a target (usually 1-hot) vector. However, it is unclear why\nthese target labels should be the optimal ones and some work has tried to identify better target label\nvectors, e.g. [57]. A number of papers have studied other drawbacks of the cross-entropy loss,\nsuch as sensitivity to noisy labels [64, 46], presence of adversarial examples [10, 36], and poor\nmargins [2]. Alternative losses have been proposed, but the most effective ideas in practice have\nbeen approaches that change the reference label distribution, such as label smoothing [47, 35], data\naugmentations such as Mixup [61] and CutMix [60], and knowledge distillation [21].\nPowerful self-supervised representation learning approaches based on deep learning models have\nrecently been developed in the natural language domain [8, 58, 33]. In the image domain, pixel-\npredictive approaches have also been used to learn embeddings [9, 62, 63, 37]. These methods consistently outperform cross entropy for varying strengths of augmentation.\n2215 Change Log\nVersion 1 (2020-04-23) Initial Arxiv version.\nVersion 2 (2020-10-22) Added analysis of different forms of supervised contrastive loss and its\ngradients as well as experimental experiments.

In all other agents, where older experiences were maintained for longer in the buffer, the\nforgetting process is slower. This does not seem to be qualitatively different for the MTR-IRM agent\n- it just seems to be able to reach a good balance between achieving a high performance in the various\nsettings, while forgetting slowly. In particular, it is hard to identify whether there has been much\nforward transfer to gravity settings that have yet to be trained on, which one might hope for by\nlearning an invariant policy: at the beginning of training, the extra IRM constraints seem to inhibit\nthe progress on all settings (as compared to the standard IRM agent), but in the latter stages the\nperformance on a number of the later settings improves drastically.\n(a) FIFO\n (b) Reservoir\n (c) Half Reservoir Half FIFO\n(d) MTR\n (e) MTR with IRM\nFigure A.1: Individual Evaluation rewards for linearly increasing gravity HalfCheetah.

(2018), and implement all other functions as three dense\nlayers of size 300with ELU activations (Clevert et al., 2015). Distributions in latent space are\n30-dimensional diagonal Gaussians. The action model outputs a tanh mean scaled by a factor of\n5 and a softplus standard deviation for the Normal distribution that is then transformed using tanh\n(Haarnoja et al., 2018). The scaling factor allows the agent to saturate the action distribution.\nLearning updates We draw batches of 50 sequences of length 50 to train the world model, value\nmodel, and action model models using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with learning rates 6\u000210\u00004,\n8\u000210\u00005,8\u000210\u00005, respectively and scale down gradient norms that exceed 100. We do not scale\nthe KL regularizers ( \f= 1) but clip them below 3free nats as in PlaNet. The imagination horizon is\nH= 15 and the same trajectories are used to update both action and value models. We compute the\nV\u0015targets with \r= 0:99and\u0015= 0:95. We did not \ufb01nd latent overshooting for learning the model,\nan entropy bonus for the action model, or target networks for the value model necessary.\nEnvironment interaction The dataset is initialized with S= 5episodes collected using random\nactions. We iterate between 100training steps and collecting 1episode by executing the predicted\nmode action with Normal(0;0:3)exploration noise.

These techniques\nmade manually speci\ufb01ed features largely redundant and have greatly improved state-of-the-art in\nseveral real-world applications [ 1,2,3]. However, many challenges remain, such as data ef\ufb01ciency,\nrobustness or generalization.\nImproving representation learning requires features that are less specialized towards solving a\nsingle supervised task. For example, when pre-training a model to do image classi\ufb01cation, the\ninduced features transfer reasonably well to other image classi\ufb01cation domains, but also lack certain\ninformation such as color or the ability to count that are irrelevant for classi\ufb01cation but relevant for\ne.g. image captioning [ 4]. Similarly, features that are useful to transcribe human speech may be\nless suited for speaker identi\ufb01cation, or music genre prediction. Thus, unsupervised learning is an\nimportant stepping stone towards robust and generic representation learning.\nDespite its importance, unsupervised learning is yet to see a breakthrough similar to supervised\nlearning: modeling high-level representations from raw observations remains elusive. Further, it\nis not always clear what the ideal representation is and if it is possible that one can learn such a\nrepresentation without additional supervision or specialization to a particular data modality.\nOne of the most common strategies for unsupervised learning has been to predict future, missing or\ncontextual information. This idea of predictive coding [ 5,6] is one of the oldest techniques in signal\nprocessing for data compression. In neuroscience, predictive coding theories suggest that the brain\npredicts observations at various levels of abstraction [ 7,8]. Recent work in unsupervised learning\nhas successfully used these ideas to learn word representations by predicting neighboring words [ 9].\nFor images, predicting color from grey-scale or the relative position of image patches has also been\nPreprint.

We hypothesize that these approaches are fruitful partly because the context\nfrom which we predict related values are often conditionally dependent on the same shared high-level\nlatent information. And by casting this as a prediction problem, we automatically infer these features\nof interest to representation learning.\nIn this paper we propose the following: \ufb01rst, we compress high-dimensional data into a much more\ncompact latent embedding space in which conditional predictions are easier to model. Secondly, we\nuse powerful autoregressive models in this latent space to make predictions many steps in the future.\nFinally, we rely on Noise-Contrastive Estimation [ 12] for the loss function in similar ways that have\nbeen used for learning word embeddings in natural language models, allowing for the whole model\nto be trained end-to-end. We apply the resulting model, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) to\nwidely different data modalities, images, speech, natural language and reinforcement learning, and\nshow that the same mechanism learns interesting high-level information on each of these domains,\noutperforming other approaches.\n2 Contrastive Predicting Coding\nWe start this section by motivating and giving intuitions behind our approach. Next, we introduce the\narchitecture of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). After that we explain the loss function that is\nbased on Noise-Contrastive Estimation. Lastly, we discuss related", "Abstract \u2014Designing agile locomotion for quadruped robots\noften requires extensive expertise and tedious manual tuning.\nIn this paper, we present a system to automate this process by\nleveraging deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our system\ncan learn quadruped locomotion from scratch using simple\nreward signals. In addition, users can provide an open loop\nreference to guide the learning process when more control over\nthe learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a\nphysics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics,\npolicies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real\nworld. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics\nsimulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation\nusing system identi\ufb01cation, developing an accurate actuator\nmodel and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by\nrandomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations\nand designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our\nsystem on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping.\nAfter learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully\nperform both gaits in the real world.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nDesigning agile locomotion for quadruped robots is a long-\nstanding research problem [1]. This is because it is dif\ufb01cult to\ncontrol an under-actuated robot performing highly dynamic\nmotion that involve intricate balance. Classical approaches\noften require extensive experience and tedious manual tuning\n[2, 3]. Can we automate this process?\nRecently, we have seen tremendous progress in deep rein-\nforcement learning (deep RL) [4, 5, 6]. These algorithms can\nsolve locomotion problems from scratch without much human\nintervention. However, most of these studies are conducted\nin simulation, and a controller learned in simulation often\nperforms poorly in the real world. This reality gap [7, 8]\nis caused by model discrepancies between the simulated and\nthe real physical system. Many factors, including unmodeled\ndynamics, wrong simulation parameters, and numerical errors,\ncontribute to this gap. Even worse, this gap is greatly ampli\ufb01ed\nin locomotion tasks. When a robot performs agile motion with\nfrequent contact changes, the switches of contact situations\nbreak the control space into fragmented pieces. Any small\nmodel discrepancy can be magni\ufb01ed and generate bifurcated\nconsequences. Overcoming the reality gap is challenging.\nAn alternative is to learn the task directly on the physical\nsystem. While this has been successfully demonstrated in\nrobotic grasping [9], it is challenging to apply this method\nFig. 1: The simulated and the real Minitaurs learned to gallop\nusing deep reinforcement learning.\nto locomotion tasks due to the dif\ufb01culties of automatically\nresetting theexperiments for model learning and policy optimization.\nInRobotics and Automation (ICRA), 2015 IEEE Inter-\nnational Conference on , pages 2620\u20132626.

In Intelligent", " Introduction\nLifelong machine learning (Thrun 1996) examines learning\nmultiple tasks in sequence, with an emphasis on how pre-\nvious knowledge of different tasks can be used to improve\nthe training time and learning of current tasks. The hope is\nthat, if sequential learning can be repeated inde\ufb01nitely, then\na system can continue to learn over the course of its lifetime.\nA continual learning agent is thought to be an important step\ntoward general arti\ufb01cial intelligence.\nRecent advances in deep learning continue to motivate re-\nsearch into neural networks that can learn multiple tasks.\nSome approaches include training separate networks for\neach task (Rusu et al. 2016; Yin and Pan 2017) and discov-\nering action hierarchies (Tessler et al. 2016), but these meth-\nods become inef\ufb01cient when scaling to multiple tasks. Ef\ufb01-\nciently retaining knowledge for every task over the course\nof a system\u2019s lifetime is a core dif\ufb01culty in implementing a\nsuch a network. When learning multiple tasks in sequence,\neach new task changes the distribution of experiences, the\noptima move, and a large set of states are no longer visited.\nAs a result of the non-stationary training distribution, the\nnetwork loses its ability to perform well in previous tasks in\nCopyright c\r2018, Association for the Advancement of Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.what has been termed catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey\nand Cohen 1989; Ratcliff 1990; Goodfellow et al. 2013).\nWe focus on deep reinforcement learning where the ef-\nfects of catastrophic forgetting are even more pronounced.\nIn deep reinforcement learning, experiences are typically\nstored in a \ufb01rst-in-\ufb01rst-out (FIFO) replay buffer. A network\nmay experience forgetting on a single task if rarely occur-\nring events fall out of the buffer (Lipton et al. 2016) or if\nthe network converges to behavior that does not consistently\nvisit the state space (de Bruin et al. 2015). This can be miti-\ngated by having a replay buffer with limitless capacity or, if\nthe task boundaries are known a priori, by maintaining sep-\narate buffers for each task. However, as the number of tasks\ngrows large, storing all experiences of all tasks becomes pro-\nhibitively expensive, and ultimately infeasible for lifelong\nlearning.\nIn this paper, we develop a process for accumulating ex-\nperiences online that enables their long term retention given\nlimited memory. We treat preserving prior ability as an ac-\ntive process where replay of prior tasks are incorporated into\nthe current learning process. In order to ef\ufb01ciently store prior\nexperiences, we propose a rank-based method for the online\ncollection and preservation of a limited set of training ex-\namples to reduce the effects of forgetting. We then explore\nfour different selection strategies to identify a good ranking\nfunction for selecting the experiences. To validate the selec-\ntion process, we apply each strategy to an autonomous driv-\ning domain where different tasks correspond to navigating\ndifferent unsigned intersections. This domain has recently\nbeen analyzed as a multi-task setting that both bene\ufb01ts from\ntransfer and allows for the speci\ufb01cation of a large variety\nof tasks (Isele and Cosgun 2017). We additionally show our experiments, but\nwith only two sequential tasks rather than \ufb01ve in order to\ntest the hypothesis. Both networks were trained on right task\n\ufb01rst, then on challenge task for 12.5 times longer.\nThe methods still displayed\ncatastrophic forgetting, whereas Distribution Matching and\nCoverage Maximization did not. The latter two strategies\nachieve nearly comparable performance to a network with\nunlimited experience replay capacity. Looking at other", "ABSTRACT\nPredicting the future in real-world settings, particularly from raw sensory obser-\nvations such as images, is exceptionally challenging.

Image quality assessment:\nfrom error", " INTRODUCTION\nDeep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) has been shown\nto be an effective framework for solving a rich reper-\ntoire of complex control problems. In simulated domains,\nagents have been developed to perform a diverse array of\nchallenging tasks [1], [2], [3]. Unfortunately, many of the\ncapabilities demonstrated by simulated agents have often\nnot been realized by their physical counterparts. Many of\nthe modern DeepRL algorithms, which have spurred recent\nbreakthroughs, pose high sample complexities, therefore\noften precluding their direct application to physical systems.\nIn addition to sample complexity, deploying RL algorithms\nin the real world also raises a number of safety concerns\nboth for the agent and its surroundings. Since exploration\nis a key component of the learning process, an agent can at\ntimes perform actions that endanger itself or its environment.\nTraining agents in simulation is a promising approach that\ncircumvents some of these obstacles. However, transferring\npolicies from simulation to the real world entails challenges\nin bridging the \u201dreality gap\u201d, the mismatch between the\nsimulated and real world environments. Narrowing this gap\nhas been a subject of intense interest in robotics, as it offers\nthe potential of applying powerful algorithms that have so\nfar been relegated to simulated domains.\nWhile signi\ufb01cant efforts have been devoted to building\nhigher \ufb01delity simulators, we show that dynamics random-\nization using low \ufb01delity simulations can also be an effective\n1OpenAI\n2UC Berkeley, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer\nScience\nFig. 1.

The effectiveness of our approach is\ndemonstrated on an object pushing task, where a policy\ntrained exclusively in simulation is able to successfully\nperform the task with a real robot without additional training\non the physical system.\nII. RELATED WORK\nRecent years have seen the application of deep reinforce-\nment learning to a growing repertoire of control problems.\nThe framework has enabled simulated agents to develop\nhighly dynamic motor skills [4], [5], [6], [7]. But due to\nthe high sample complexity of RL algorithms and other\nphysical limitations, many of the capabilities demonstrated\nin simulation have yet to be replicated in the physical world.\nGuided Policy Search (GPS) [8] represents one of the few\nalgorithms capable of training policies directly on a real\nrobot. By leveraging trajectory optimization with learned lin-\near dynamics models, the method is able to develop complex\nmanipulation skills with relatively few interactions with the\nenvironment. The method has also been extended to learning\nvision-based manipulation policies [9]. Researchers have also\nexplored parallelizing training across multiple robots [10].\nNonetheless, successful examples of training policies directly\non physical robots have so far been demonstrated only on\nrelatively restrictive domains.\nA. Domain Adaptation\nThe problem of transferring control policies from sim-\nulation to the real world can be viewed as an instance\nof domain adaptation, where a model trained in a source\ndomain is transfered to a new target domain.

The leading contenders are deep Q-learning [Mni+15],\n\u201cvanilla\u201d policy gradient Background: Policy Optimization\n2.1 Policy Gradient Methods\nIn TRPO [Sch+15b], an objective function (the \u201csurrogate\u201d objective) is maximized subject to a\nconstraint on the size of the policy update.

(4)\nHere,\u03b8oldis the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can e\ufb03ciently be\napproximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation\nto the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.\nThe theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,\nsolving the unconstrained optimization problem\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]/bracketrightbigg\n(5)\nfor some coe\ufb03cient \u03b2. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes\nthe max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the\nperformance of the policy \u03c0. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard\nto choose a single value of \u03b2that performs well across di\ufb00erent problems\u2014or even within a single\nproblem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal\nof a \ufb01rst-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Experiments\n6.1 Comparison of Surrogate Objectives\nFirst, we compare several di\ufb00erent surrogate objectives under di\ufb00erent hyperparameters. Here, we\ncompare the surrogate objective LCLIPto several natural variations and ablated versions.\nNo clipping or penalty: Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\nClipping: Lt(\u03b8) = min(rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At,clip(rt(\u03b8)),1\u2212/epsilon1,1 +/epsilon1)\u02c6At\nKL penalty (\ufb01xed or adaptive) Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old,\u03c0\u03b8]\n5For the KL penalty, one can either use a \ufb01xed penalty coe\ufb03cient \u03b2or an adaptive coe\ufb03cient as\ndescribed in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2\nimplemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do\none million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping ( /epsilon1)\nand the KL penalty ( \u03b2,dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in\nTable 3.\nTo represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,\nand tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard\ndeviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don\u2019t share parameters between the policy and value\nfunction (so coe\ufb03cient c1is irrelevant), and we don\u2019t use an entropy bonus.\nEach algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each\nrun of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted\nand scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best\nresult was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.\nThe Results from continuous control benchmark.

Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript\u210e\ud835\udc61h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121subscript\u210e\ud835\udc611h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position t\ud835\udc61titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n \n\n2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\u00a03.2.\n\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned", " INTRODUCTION\nPerforming robotic learning in a physics simulator could\naccelerate the impact of machine learning on robotics by\nallowing faster, more scalable, and lower-cost data collection\nthan is possible with physical robots. Learning in simula-\ntion is especially promising for building on recent results\nin computer vision use realistic textures, but do not create\ncoherent 3D scenes. Instead, objects are rendered against a\nsolid methods. See [13] for a more complete treatment of\ndomain adaptation in the reinforcement learning literature.\nIn this paper we study the possibility of transfer from\nsimulation to the real world without performing domain\nadaptation.\nC. Bridging the reality gap\nPrevious work on leveraging simulated data for physical\nrobotic RELATED WORK\nA. Object detection and pose estimation for robotics\nObject detection and pose estimation for robotics is a well-\nstudied problem in the literature (see, e.g., [4], [5], [6], [10],\n[44], [50], [54]). Recent approaches typically involve of\ufb02ine\nconstruction or learning of a 3D model of objects in the\nscene (e.g., a full 3D mesh model [44] or a 3D metric feature\nrepresentation [5]). At test time, features from the test data\n(e.g., Scale-Invariant Feature Transform [SIFT] features [12]\nor color co-occurrence histograms [10]) are matched with the\n3D models (or features from the 3D models). For example,\na black-box nonlinear optimization algorithm can be used\nto minimize the re-projection error of the SIFT points from\nthe object model and the 2D points in the test image [4].\nMost successful approaches rely on using multiple camera\nframes [6] or depth information [44]. There has also been\nsome success with only monocular camera images [4].\nCompared to our method, traditional approaches require\nless extensive training and take advantage of richer sensory\ndata, allowing them to detect the full 3D pose of objects\n(position and orientation) without any assumptions about\nthe location or size of the surface on which the objects\nare placed. However, our approach avoids the challenging\nproblem of 3D reconstruction, and employs a simple, easy\nto implement deep learning-based pipeline that may scale\nbetter to more challenging problems.\nB. Domain adaptation\nThe computer vision community has devoted signi\ufb01cant\nstudy to the problem of adapting vision-based models trained\nin a source domain to a previously unseen target domain\n(see, e.g., [9], [14], [15], [19], [23], [25], [51]). A varietyof approaches have been proposed, including re-training the\nmodel in the target domain (e.g., [52]), adapting the weights\nof the model based on the statistics of the source and target\ndomains (e.g., [22]), learning invariant features between\ndomains (e.g., [47]), and learning a mapping from the target\ndomain to the source domain (e.g., [43]). Researchers in\nthe reinforcement learning community have also studied the\nproblem of domain adaptation by learning invariant feature\nrepresentations [13], adapting pretrained networks [35], and\nother background are unnecessary, despite some clutter (e.g.,\ncables) on the \ufb02oor in our real images.\nOur method avoids calibration and precise placement of\nthe camera in the real world by randomizing characteristics\nof the cameras used to render images in training. We manu-\nally place a camera in the simulated scene that approximately\nmatches the viewpoint and \ufb01eld of view of the real camera.\nEach training sample places the camera randomly within a\n(10\u00025\u000210)cm box around this initial point. The viewing\nangle of the camera is calculated analytically to point at a\n\ufb01xed point on the table, and then offset by up to 0:1radians\nin each direction. The \ufb01eld of view is also scaled", "Abstract \u2014 Reinforcement learning (RL) can automate a wide\nvariety of robotic skills, but learning each new skill requires\nconsiderable real-world data collection and manual representa-\ntion engineering to design policy classes or features.

Background and problem formulation\nAs usual, we assume that the interaction between agent and environment can be modeled as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP, Puterman, [ 19]).

The dominance of DBN-based approaches has been recently overturned by a\nresurgence of interest in recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches. An RNN is a special\ntype of neural network that is able to handle both variable-length input and output. By training an\nRNN to predict the next output in a sequence, given all previous outputs, it can be used to model\njoint probability distribution over sequences.\nBoth RNNs and DBNs consist of two parts: (1) a transition function that determines the evolution\nof the internal hidden state, and (2) a mapping from the state to the output. There are, however, a\nfew important differences between RNNs and DBNs.\nDBNs have typically been limited either to relatively simple state transition structures (e.g., linear\nmodels in the case of the Kalman \ufb01lter) or to relatively simple internal state structure (e.g., the HMM\nstate space consists of a single set of mutually exclusive states). RNNs, on the other hand, typically\npossess both a richly distributed internal state representation and \ufb02exible non-linear transition func-\ntions. These differences give RNNs extra expressive power in comparison to DBNs. This expressive\npower and the ability to train via error backpropagation are the key reasons why RNNs have gained\npopularity as generative models for highly structured sequential data.\nIn this paper, we focus on another important difference between DBNs and RNNs. While the hidden\nstate in DBNs is expressed in terms of random variables, the internal transition structure of the\nstandard RNN is entirely deterministic. The only source of randomness or variability in the RNN\nis found in the conditional output probability model. We suggest that this can be an inappropriate\nway to model the kind of variability observed in highly structured data, such as natural speech,\nwhich is characterized by strong and complex dependencies among the output variables at different\n1Code is available at http://www.github.com/jych/nips2015_vrnn\n1arXiv:1506.02216v6  [cs.LG]  6 Apr 2016timesteps. We argue, as have others [4, 2], that these complex dependencies cannot be modelled\nef\ufb01ciently by the output probability models used in standard RNNs, which include either a simple\nunimodal distribution or a mixture of unimodal distributions.\nWe propose the use of high-level latent random variables to model the variability observed in the\ndata. In the context of standard neural network models for non-sequential data, the variational au-\ntoencoder (V AE) [11, 17] offers an interesting combination of highly \ufb02exible non-linear mapping\nbetween the latent random state and the observed output and effective approximate inference. In this\npaper, we propose to extend the V AE into a recurrent framework for modelling high-dimensional\nsequences. The V AE can model complex multimodal distributions, which will help when the un-\nderlying true data distribution consists of multimodal conditional distributions. We call this model\navariational RNN (VRNN).\nA natural question to ask is: how do we encode observed variability via latent random variables?\nThe answer to this question depends on the nature of the data itself. In this work, we are mainly\ninterested in highly structured data that often arises in AI applications. By highly structured, we\nmean that the data is characterized by two properties. Firstly,"]}

This research could lead to advancements in various applications, such as robotics, AI chatbots, and recommendation systems, where uncertainty plays a critical role. By addressing this question, we could pave the way for more robust and efficient algorithms that can handle real-world complexities, ultimately influencing future research directions in reinforcement learning and AI.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent complexities of partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), where the agent must make decisions based on incomplete information. Naive approaches may fail because they do not adequately account for the uncertainty in the latent state, leading to suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, integrating probabilistic inference into sequence models while maintaining computational efficiency poses significant technical obstacles. The need for effective representation of uncertainty and the balance between model complexity and performance further complicate the problem.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on either deterministic sequence models or probabilistic models in isolation, leading to a lack of exploration of their potential synergies. Limitations in computational resources and the complexity of integrating probabilistic inference into model-free architectures have also hindered progress. Existing solutions often overlook the importance of reasoning over latent state uncertainty in decision-making processes. Our approach differs by explicitly investigating the integration of probabilistic inference methods into model-free architectures, potentially offering a novel perspective that has not been thoroughly explored in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a sequence model that incorporates probabilistic inference mechanisms, inspired by the Recurrent Kalman Network (RKN) architecture. We will evaluate this model on a dataset simulating a restaurant recommendation scenario, where the agent must infer user preferences based on partial observations. The performance will be measured using metrics such as user satisfaction and recommendation accuracy. We expect that our approach will demonstrate improved decision-making capabilities in environments characterized by uncertainty, leading to more", "proposal_5q": ["[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can a hybrid decentralized multiagent system that integrates learning-based model predictive control with adaptive Bayesian optimization techniques enhance accountability and cooperation among agents operating in dynamic environments?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem has significant implications for the research community, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous systems. By developing a framework that improves accountability and cooperation among agents, we can pave the way for more efficient and reliable systems in high-stakes scenarios such as disaster response and autonomous vehicle coordination. This research could lead to advancements in safety protocols, enabling agents to adapt dynamically to environmental changes and uncertainties. Furthermore, the integration of adaptive watermarking protocols to track accountability metrics fosters trust among agents, which is crucial for collaborative tasks. This work not only contributes to theoretical knowledge but also has practical applications that could enhance the effectiveness of multiagent systems in real-world situations.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nAddressing this problem is inherently complex due to several challenges. First, the dynamic nature of environments means that agents must continuously adapt their decision-making strategies in real-time, which requires sophisticated learning algorithms that can efficiently process incoming data. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate interactions between agents or the varying levels of uncertainty present in the environment. Additionally, the integration of learning-based model predictive control with adaptive Bayesian optimization presents technical challenges in ensuring that these methodologies can coexist and complement each other effectively. The need for robust accountability mechanisms further complicates matters, as establishing trust among agents requires precise tracking of behaviors and decision-making processes in potentially high-stakes situations.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has often focused on either decentralized multiagent systems or optimization techniques in isolation, leading to a lack of comprehensive frameworks that address both accountability and cooperation in dynamic environments. Limitations in existing solutions include inadequate handling of real-time decision-making processes and insufficient mechanisms for tracking accountability metrics. Moreover, many prior studies have not effectively integrated adaptive watermarking protocols, which are essential for fostering trust among agents. My approach differs from prior work by offering a unified framework that combines learning-based control and Bayesian optimization, ensuring that agents can adapt their strategies while maintaining accountability in a cohesive manner, thus overcoming the barriers that have hindered progress in this area.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid decentralized multiagent system that utilizes learning-based model predictive control in conjunction with adaptive Bayesian optimization techniques. The approach will be implemented using a simulation dataset that reflects dynamic environments, such as urban traffic scenarios or disaster response situations. Key metrics for evaluation will include accountability metrics, safety parameters, and overall system efficiency, which will be assessed through both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Expected outcomes include enhanced decision-making strategies for agents, improved safety and efficiency in navigating complex environments, and a robust accountability framework that fosters trust among agents.

In current model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), the agent learns the world model from past experiences, enabling it to \u201cimagine\u201d the consequences of its actions (such as the future environment rewards and observations) and make informed decisions. \n\n\nMBRL necessitates learning a world model that accurately simulates the environment\u2019s evolution and future rewards, integrating the agent\u2019s actions over long horizons. This task is compounded by the credit assignment (CA) problem, where an action\u2019s impact on future rewards must be evaluated. The agent also may need to memorize and recall past experiences to infer optimal actions. The challenge of long-term memory and CA frequently arises as a result of inadequate learning of long-range dependencies (Ni et\u00a0al., 2023), due to constraints in world models\u2019 backbone network architecture.\n\n\nMore specifically, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs; Cho et\u00a0al. (2014)) are employed in most MBRL methods (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Hafner et\u00a0al., 2019b; a; 2020; 2023) as the world models\u2019 backbone architecture because of their ability to handle sequential data. However, their efficacy is hindered by the vanishing gradients (Bengio et\u00a0al., 1994; Pascanu et\u00a0al., 2013). Alternately, due to the remarkable achievements of Transformers (Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017) in language modeling tasks (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Thoppilan et\u00a0al., 2022), they have been recently adopted to build world models (Chen et\u00a0al., 2022; Micheli et\u00a0al., 2023; Robine et\u00a0al., 2023). Nonetheless, the computational complexity of Transformers is quadratic in its input sequence length. Even the optimized Transformers (Dai et\u00a0al., 2019; Zaheer et\u00a0al., 2021; Choromanski et\u00a0al., 2022; Bulatov et\u00a0al., 2022; Ding et\u00a0al., 2023) become unstable during training on long sequences (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022). This prohibits Transformers-based world models from scaling to long input sequence lengths that might be required in certain RL tasks.\n\n\nRecent studies have revealed that state space models (SSMs) can effectively capture dependencies in tremendously long sequences for supervised learning (SL) and self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks (Gu et\u00a0al., 2021a; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2022; Mehta et\u00a0al., 2022; Smith et\u00a0al., 2023; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023). More specifically, the S4 model (Gu et\u00a0al., 2021a) redefined the long-range sequence modeling research landscape by mastering highly difficult benchmarks (Tay et\u00a0al., 2020). The S4 model is derived from a time-invariant linear dynamical system where state matrices are learned (Gu et\u00a0al., 2021b). In SL and SSL tasks, it exhibits a remarkable capability to capture dependencies extending up to 16K in length, surpassing the limitations of all prior methods. Given these achievements and MBRL methods\u2019 limitations in solving memory and CA tasks, the adoption of S4 or a modified version of it is a logical decision. In this paper, we introduce a novel method termed Recall to Imagine (R2I), which is the first MBRL approach utilizing a variant of S4 (which was previously employed in model-free RL (David et\u00a0al., 2023; Lu et\u00a0al.,", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nReinforcement learning holds great potential to automatically learn optimal policies, mapping observations to return-maximizing actions.\nHowever, the application of RL in the real world encounters challenges when observations are high-dimensional and/or noisy.\nThese challenges become even more severe in partially observable environments, where the observation (history) dimension grows over time.\nIn fact, current RL algorithms are often brittle and sample inefficient in these settings\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2019; Stone et\u00a0al., 2021; Tomar et\u00a0al., 2021; Morad et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nTo address the curse of dimensionality, a substantial body of work has focused on compressing observations into a latent state space, known as state abstraction in MDPs\u00a0(Dayan, 1993; Dean & Givan, 1997; Li et\u00a0al., 2006), history abstraction in POMDPs\u00a0(Littman et\u00a0al., 2001; Castro et\u00a0al., 2009; Baisero & Amato, 2020), and sufficient statistics or information states in stochastic control\u00a0(Striebel, 1965; Kwakernaak, 1965; Bohlin, 1970; Kumar & Varaiya, 1986).\nTraditionally, this compression has been achieved through hand-crafted feature extractors\u00a0(Sutton, 1995; Konidaris et\u00a0al., 2011) or with the discovery of a set of core tests sufficient for predicting future observations\u00a0(Littman et\u00a0al., 2001; Singh et\u00a0al., 2003). Modern approaches learn the latent state space using an encoder to automatically filter out irrelevant parts of observations\u00a0(Lange & Riedmiller, 2010; Watter et\u00a0al., 2015; Munk et\u00a0al., 2016).\nFurthermore, deep RL enables end-to-end and online learning of compact state or history representations alongside policy training.\nAs a result, numerous representation learning techniques for RL have surfaced (refer to subsection\u00a03.2), drawing inspiration from diverse fields within ML and RL. However, this abundance of methods may have inadvertently presented practitioners with a \u201cparadox of choice\u201d, hindering their ability to identify the best approach for their specific RL problem.\n\n\nThis paper aims to offer systematic guidance regarding the essential characteristics that good representations should possess in RL (the \u201cwhat\u201d) and effective strategies for learning such representations (the \u201chow\u201d).\nWe begin our analysis from first principles by comparing and connecting various representations proposed in prior works for MDPs and POMDPs, resulting in a unified view.\nRemarkably, these representations are all connected by a self-predictive condition \u2013 the encoder can predict its next latent state\u00a0(Subramanian et\u00a0al., 2022).\nNext, we examine how to learn such self-predictive condition in RL, a difficult subtask due to the bootstrapping effect\u00a0(Gelada et\u00a0al., 2019; Schwarzer et\u00a0al., 2020; Tang et\u00a0al., 2022). We provide fresh insights on why the popular \u201cstop-gradient\u201d technique, in which the parameters of the encoder do not update when used as a target, has the promise of learning the desired condition without representational collapse in POMDPs. Building on our new theoretical findings, we introduce a minimalist RL algorithm that learns self-predictive representations end-to-end with a single auxiliary loss, without the need for reward model learning (thereby removing planning)\u00a0(Fran\u00e7ois-Lavet et\u00a0al., 2019; Gelada et\u00a0al., 2019; Tomar et\u00a0al., 2021; Hansen et\u00a0al., 2022; Ghugare et\u00a0al., 2022; Ye et\u00a0al., 2021; Subramanian et\u00a0al., 2022), reward regularization\u00a0(Eysenbach et\u00a0al., 2021), multi-step predictions and projections\u00a0(Schwarzer et\u00a0al., 2020; Guo et\u00a0al., 2020), and metric learning\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020; Castro et\u00a0al., 2021). Furthermore, the simplicity of our approach allows us to investigate the role of representation learning in RL, in isolation from policy optimization.\n\n\nThe core contributions of this paper are as follows.\nWe establish a unified view of state and", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have emerged as an effective paradigm in modern machine learning.\nThe backbone of these FMs are often\nsequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics\n\\parencitesutskever2014sequence,dosovitskiy2020image,oord2016wavenet,brown2020language,ismail2019deep,poli2023hyena.\nWhile this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture,\nmodern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer\u00a0\\parencitevaswani2017attention and its core attention layer\u00a0\\parencitebahdanau2015neural\nThe efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data.\nHowever, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window,\nand quadratic scaling with respect to the window length.\nAn enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks\u00a0\\parencitetay2022efficient,\nbut often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective.\nAs of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains.\n\n\nRecently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs)\u00a0\\parencitegu2021combining,gu2022efficiently have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling.\nThese models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with inspiration from classical state space models \\parencitekalman1960new.\nThis class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length.\nAdditionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies\u00a0\\parencitegu2020hippo in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the Long Range Arena\u00a0\\parencitetay2021long.\nMany flavors of SSMs \u00a0\\parencitegu2022efficiently,gupta2022diagonal,gu2022parameterization,li2023makes,ma2023mega,smith2023s5,orvieto2023resurrecting\nhave been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision\u00a0\\parencitegoel2022raw,saon2023diagonal,nguyen2022s4nd.\nHowever, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text.\n\n\nWe propose a new class of selective state space models,\nthat improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length.\n\n\nSelection Mechanism.\n\nFirst, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e.\u00a0focus on or ignore particular inputs).\nBuilding on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input.\nThis allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely.\n\n\n\nHardware-aware Algorithm.\n\nThis simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient.\nWe overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy.\nThe resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to 3\u00d7\\times\u00d7 faster on A100 GPUs).\n\n\n\nArchitecture.\n\nWe simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures \\parencitedao2023hungry with the MLP block of Transformers into a", " Introduction\nWorld models attempt to learn a compact and expressive representation of the environment dynamics\nfrom observed data. These models can predict possible future world states as a function of an\nimagined action sequence and are a key ingredient of model-predictive control [ 4] and model-based\nreinforcement learning (RL). One important dimension of world models is the level of temporal\ngranularity or the time scale at which the model operates. Existing literature on world models operates\nat a single level of temporal abstraction, typically at a fine-grained level such as milliseconds. One\ndrawback of single-time scale world models is that they may not capture longer-term trends and\npatterns in the data [18].\nFor efficient long-horizon prediction and planning, the model needs to predict at multiple levels of\ntemporal abstractions [ 29,23]. Intuitively, low-level temporal abstractions should contain precise\ndetails about the input so as to predict accurately in the short term, while high-level, abstract action is an inferred latent variable with an associated uncertainty estimate.\nHence we use a linear control model Y, for principled uncertainty propagation.\nA.3.2 Transition Noise\nWe assume the covariance of the transition noise QandSin both timescales to be diagonal. The\nnoise is learned and is independent of the latent state.\nA.4 Training\nA.4.1 Training Objective Derivation\nWe further expand on the training objective in Section 4.2 here. The training objective for the MTS3\ninvolves maximizing the posterior predictive log-likelihood which for a single trajectory, can be\nderived as,\nL=NX\nk=1HX\nt=1logp(ok,t+1|\u03b21:k\u22121,\u03b11:k\u22121,wk,1:t,ak,1:t)\n=NX\nk=1HX\nt=1logZZ\np(ok,t+1|zk,t+1)p(zk,t+1|wk,1:t,ak,1:t,lk)p(lk|\u03b21:k\u22121,\u03b11:k\u22121)dzk,t+1dlk\n=NX\nk=1HX\nt=1logZ\np(ok,t+1|zk,t+1)plk(zk,t+1|wk,1:t,ak,1:t)dzk,t+1. (15)\nThe extension to multiple trajectories is straightforward. The approximation to the objective is done\nbased on a moment-matching perspective as discussed in Section 4.2 of the main paper.\nA.4.2 Initialization\nWe initialize the states l1andz1,1at both timescales for the first-time window k= 1with an all zeros\nvector and corresponding covariance matrices as \u03a3l1=\u03a3z1,1= 10\u00b7I. For subsequent windows, the\nprior belief p(zk,1)for the first time step of time window k, is initialized using the posterior belief\nplk\u22121(zk\u22121,H|wk\u22121,1:H,ak\u22121,1:H)of the last time step of time window k\u22121.\nIt is also crucial to correctly initialize the transition matrix at both time scales so that the transition\ndoes not yield an unstable system. Initially, the transition model should focus on copying the encoder\noutput so that the encoder can learn how to extract good features if observations are available and\nuseful. We initialize the diagonal elements of the transition matrix at both timescales with 1 and the\noff-diagonal elements with 0.2, while the rest of the elements are set to 0, a choice inspired from [ 1].\nA.4.3 Learnable Parameters\nThe learnable parameters in the computation graph are as follows:\nFast Time Scale SSM: The linear transition model A, the non-linear control factor b, the linear\nlatent task transformation model C, the transition noise Q, along with the observation encoder and\nthe output decoder.\nSlow Time Scale SSM: The linear transition model X, the linear control model Y , the transition\nnoise S, along with the observation set encoder and the action set encoder.\n17B Proofs and Derivations\nri \u2113\nN\nFigure 8: Graphical Model\nFor Bayesian conditioning\nwithNobservations.In the following sections vectors are denoted by a lowercase letter in\nbold, such as \" v\", while Matrices as an uppercase letter in bold, such\nas \"M\".Idenotes identity matrix and 0represents a matrix filled\nwith zeros.

Uncertainty is at the heart of the RL problem: on one hand,\naleatoric uncertainty refers to the stochasticity in the MDP transitions and the RL agent\u2019s action\nselection; on the other hand, epistemic uncertainty appears due to lack of knowledge about\nthe MDP. During policy evaluation, both sources of uncertainty induce a distribution of possible\nreturns, which should be considered for policy optimization. For instance, in high-stakes\napplications like medical treatments, accounting for aleatoric noise is key towards training\nrisk-averse policies (Chow et\u00a0al., 2015; Keramati et\u00a0al., 2020). Similarly, effective\nexploration can be achieved by proper handling of epistemic uncertainty\n(Deisenroth and Rasmussen, 2011; Curi et\u00a0al., 2020).\n\n\nTwo paradigms have emerged to capture uncertainty in the predicted outcomes of a policy. First,\ndistributional RL (Bellemare et\u00a0al., 2017) models the aleatoric uncertainty\nabout returns, due to the inherent noise of the decision process. In contrast, Bayesian RL\n(Ghavamzadeh et\u00a0al., 2015) captures the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown\nexpected return of a policy, denoted as the value function, due to incomplete\nknowledge of the MDP. As such, the distribution over outcomes from each perspective has\nfundamentally different meaning and utility. If we care about effective exploration of\nunknown (rather than stochastic) outcomes, then Bayesian RL is the appropriate choice of\nframework (Osband et\u00a0al., 2019).\n\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the Bayesian RL setting where a posterior distribution over possible MDPs\ninduces a distribution over value functions. The posterior over values naturally models the\nepistemic uncertainty about the long-term performance of the agent, which is the guiding principle\nbehind provably-efficient exploration (Strehl and Littman, 2008; Jaksch et\u00a0al., 2010). An open\nquestion remains how to effectively model and learn the posterior distribution over value functions.\nWe approach this problem by using tools from distributional RL in the Bayesian framework. The key\nidea is that, for time-inhomogeneous MDPs with a tabular representation, the value distribution\nfollows a Bellman equation from which we can derive an iterative estimation algorithm that resembles\nmethods from distributional RL. Based on this insight, we present a novel algorithm that uses a\nlearned value distribution for policy optimization.\n\n\nOur contribution.\n\nWe introduce the value-distributional Bellman equation that describes the relationship between the\nvalue distributions over successive steps. Moreover, we show that the fixed-point of the associated\nBellman operator is precisely the posterior value distribution. Then, leveraging tools from\ndistributional RL, we propose a practical algorithm for learning the quantiles of the value\ndistribution function. We propose Epistemic Quantile-Regression (EQR), a model-based policy\noptimization algorithm that learns a distributional value function. Finally, we combine EQR with\nsoft actor-critic (SAC) to optimize a policy for any differentiable objective function of the\nlearned value distribution (e.g., mean, exponential risk, CVaR, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Related work\n\nDistributional RL.\n\nThe treatment of the policy return as a random variable dates back to Sobel (1982),\nwhere it is shown that the higher moments of the return obeys a Bellman equation. More recently,\ndistributional RL has emerged as a paradigm for modelling and utilizing the entire distribution of\nreturns (Tamar et\u00a0al., 2013; Bellemare et\u00a0al., 2023), with real-world applications\nincluding guidance of stratospheric balloons (Bellemare et\u00a0al., 2020) and super-human\nrace-driving in simulation (Wurman et\u00a0al., 2022). The distributional RL toolbox has expanded\nover the years with diverse distribution representations\n(Bellemare et\u00a0al.,", " Introduction\nIn recent years, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019) have achieved remarkable\nsuccess in domains ranging from language modeling to computer vision. Within the RL community,\nthere has been excitement around the idea that large models with attention architectures, such as\nTransformers, might enable rapid progress on challenging RL tasks.

Related Work\nMemory and credit assignment have been extensively studied in RL, with representative works\nshown in Table 1. The work most closely related to ours is bsuite (Osband et al., 2020), which\n6Figure 2: Pixel-based tasks, Passive Visual Match (left) and Key-to-Door (right), evaluated\nin our experiments (Sec. 5.3) are relatively cheap to compute. Each experiment run was carried out on a\nsingle A100 GPU and a single CPU core. For Transformer-based RL, the GPU memory usage is\napproximately proportional to the square of the context lengths, with a maximum usage of 4GB for\nPassive T-Maze with a context length of 1500 . For LSTM-based RL, GPU memory usage is roughly\nlinearly proportional.\nIn our tasks, the context length equals the episode length (and also memory length), thus the total\ntraining time is proportional to num_episodes * context_length**2 * update_frequency\nfor both Transformers and LSTMs. The update_frequency , set as 0.25, is the ratio of parameter\nupdate w.r.t. environment step. Additionally, for multi-layer Transformers, the training time is roughly\nlinear to the number of layers. Table 6 summarizes the training hyperparameters.\nIn Passive T-Maze with a memory length of 1500 , it took around 6 and 4 days to train Transformer-\nbased and LSTM-based RL, respectively. In Passive Visual Match with a memory length of 1000 , it\ntook around 5 days for both Transformer-based and LSTM-based RL.\nD Broader Impacts\nOur work enhances understanding of long-term memory capability in Transformer-based RL. This\nimproved memory capability, while offering advancements in RL, may pose privacy concerns if\nmisused, potentially enabling systems to retain and misuse sensitive information. As this technology\ndevelops, strict data privacy measures are essential. However, negative impacts directly tied to our\nfoundational research are speculative, as we propose no specific application of this technology.\n24 Results\nFig. 11 shows the learning curves of training Transformers with varying numbers of layers and heads.\nSimilar to the scaling Conclusion\nIn this study, we evaluate the memory and credit assignment capabilities of memory-based RL agents,\nwith a focus on Transformer-based RL. While Transformer-based agents excel in tasks requiring\nlong-term memory, they do not improve long-term credit assignment and generally have poor sample\nefficiency. Furthermore, we highlighted that many existing RL tasks, even those designed to evaluate\n(long-term) memory or credit assignment, often intermingle both capabilities or require only short-\nterm dependencies. While", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nStructured state space sequence (S4) models\u00a0(Gu et\u00a0al., 2021a) and their variants such as S5\u00a0(Smith et\u00a0al., 2022) have recently achieved impressive results in long-range sequence modelling tasks, far outperforming other popular sequence models such as the Transformer\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017) and LSTM\u00a0(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) on the Long-Range Arena benchmark\u00a0(Tay et\u00a0al., 2020). Notably, S4 was the first architecture to achieve a non-trivial result on the difficult Path-X task, which requires the ability to handle extremely long-range dependencies of lengths 16\u2062k16\ud835\udc5816k16 italic_k.\n\n\nFurthermore, S4 models display a number of desirable properties that are not directly tested by raw performance benchmarks. Unlike transformers, for which the per step runtime usually scales quadratically with the sequence length, S4 models have highly-scalable inference runtime performance, asymptotically using constant memory and time per step with respect to the sequence length. While LSTMs and other RNNs also have this property, empirically, S4 models are far more performant while also being parallelisable across the sequence dimension during training.\n\n\nWhile inference-time is normally not included when evaluating on sequence modelling benchmarks,\nit has a large impact on the scalability and wallclock-time for reinforcement learning (RL) because the agent uses inference to collect data from the environment. Thus, transformers usually have poor runtime performance in reinforcement learning\u00a0(Parisotto and Salakhutdinov, 2021). While transformers have become the default architecture for many supervised sequence-modelling tasks\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017), RNNs are still widely-used for memory-based RL tasks\u00a0(Ni et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nThe ability to efficiently model contexts that are orders of magnitude larger may enable new possibilities in RL. This is particularly applicable in meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL), in which the agent is trained to adapt across multiple environment episodes. One approach to Meta-RL, RL22{}^{2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT\u00a0(Duan et\u00a0al., 2016; Wang et\u00a0al., 2016), uses sequence models to directly learn across these episodes, which can often result in trajectories that are thousands of steps long. Most instances of RL22{}^{2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT approaches, however, are limited to narrow task distributions and short adaptation horizons because of their limited effective memory length and slow training speeds.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, simply applying S4 models to reinforcement learning is challenging. This is because the most popular training paradigm in on-policy RL with multiple actors involves collecting fixed-length environment trajectories, which often cross episode boundaries. RNNs handle episode boundaries by resetting the hidden state at those transitions when performing backpropagation through time. Unlike RNNs, S4 models cannot simply reset their hidden states within the sequence because they train using a fixed convolution kernel instead of using backpropagation through time.\n\n\nA recent modification to S4, called Simplified Structured State Space Sequence Models (S5), replaces this convolution with a parallel scan operation\u00a0(Smith et\u00a0al., 2022), which we describe in Section 2. In this paper, we propose a modification to S5 that enables resetting its hidden state within a trajectory during the training phase, which in turn allows practitioners to simply replace RNNs with S5 layers in existing frameworks. We then demonstrate S5\u2019s performance and runtime properties on the simple bsuite memory-length task\u00a0(Osband et\u00a0al., 2019), showing that S5 achieves a higher score than RNNs while also being nearly two times faster when using their provided baseline algorithm.\nWe also", " Introduction to multi-armed bandits.

To understand the gap between SSMs and attention, we draw\non synthetic language modeling tasks that have been proposed as a mechanistic basis for in-context learning\nin Transformers [ 49] These synthetic languages focus on the ability to manipulate text|recalling tokens\nfrom earlier time steps, or comparing tokens from di\u000berent points in a sequence. We \fnd that existing SSMs\nstruggle to model these synthetic languages. To probe how important these skills are for language modeling,\nwe propose H3(Hungry Hungry Hippo), a new SSM-based layer designed to solve these language modeling\ntasks. H3stacks two SSMs, with multiplicative interactions between their outputs and input projections.\nThe SSMs allow H3to keep a log of tokens (to recall them later), while the multiplicative interactions allow\nfor comparisons across the sequence.\nH3matches attention on the synthetic languages and almost closes the gap with Transformers on language\nmodeling|coming within 0.4 perplexity of Transformers on OpenWebText (compared to 3.4 ppl for existing\nSSMs|even those explicitly designed for language modeling [ 42]). Furthermore, a simple hybrid H3-attention\nmodel that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0\nperplexity. To further evaluate H3on language modeling, we train 125M-, 355M-, 1.3B-, and 2.7B-parameter\nhybrid H3-attention language models on the Pile [ 21], using hyperparameters from GPT-3 [ 7]. These\nhybrid models outperform Transformer-based language models of the same size in perplexity, and match or\noutperform them on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark in zero- and few-shot learning. Since\nthe SSM layers in these hybrid models admit a recurrent view, they can also perform 2.4 \u0002faster inference\nthan Transformers.\nScaling SSMs. Next, we improve", " Introduction\nAccurate system models are crucial for model-based control and reinforcement learning (RL) in au-\ntonomous systems applications under partial observability. Practitioners commonly use state space models\n(SSMs) (Murphy, 2012) to formalize such systems. SSMs consist of a dynamics model, describing how one\nstate relates to the next, and an observation model, which describes how system states generate observations.\nYet, dynamics and observation models are unknown for most relevant problems, and exact inference in the\nresulting SSM is usually intractable. Researchers have proposed numerous approaches to learn the models\nfrom data and approximate the inference to solve those issues.\nRecurrent State Space Models (RSSMs) (Hafner et al., 2019) are of particular interest here. Using RSSMs\nas the backbone for their Deep Planning Network (PlaNet) , Hafner et al. (2019) showed that variational\nlatent dynamics learning can succeed in image-based RL for complex control tasks. Combined with simple\n1Code available at: https://github.com/pbecker93/vrkn\n1arXiv:2210.09256v1  [cs.LG]  17 Oct 2022Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2022)\nplanning, RSSMscan match the performance of model-free RL while requiring signi\ufb01cantly fewer environ-\nment interactions. The authors later improved upon their original model, including a parametric policy\ntrained on imagined trajectories ( Dreamer ) (Hafner et al., 2020). In general, approaches based on RSSMs\nhave found considerable interest in the model-based RL community. Yet, while RSSMs draw inspiration\nfrom classical SSMs, they use a simpli\ufb01ed inference scheme. During inference, they assume the belief is\nindependent of future observations instead of using the correct smoothing assumptions (Murphy, 2012) to\nobtain the belief. We formalize this observation in Section 2 and discuss how these simpli\ufb01ed assumptions\nresult in a theoretically looser variational lower bound. Further, we analyze the e\ufb00ects of these assumptions\non model learning and \ufb01nd they cause an overestimation of aleatoric uncertainty. Such aleatoric uncertainty\nstems from partial observability or inherent stochasticity of the system (H\u00fcllermeier & Waegeman, 2021).\nIt plays an important role in many realistic tasks, e.g., in the form of occlusions, missing observations, or\nobservations arriving in di\ufb00erent modalities and frequencies. Consider, for example, low-frequency camera\nimages providing external information and high-frequency proprioceptive measurements of the robot\u2019s inter-\nnal state. Given such sensory inputs, we require an appropriate estimation of aleatoric uncertainty to fuse\nall information optimally and form accurate belief states. Our results are displayed in Figure 37 and show that neither an increased state size nor Bayesian treatment\nyields signi\ufb01cant performance improvements.\n30Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2022)\nVRKN (no MCD) VRKN RSSM\nCheetah Run 705.1629\u00b17.3881 749 .2355\u00b15.3298 627 .4290\u00b17.4144\nWalker Walk 889.8291\u00b114.2379 940.5245\u00b111.0899 945 .8944\u00b12.1465\nCartpole Swingup 625.0746\u00b122.7305 779 .3265\u00b17.7148 790 .4359\u00b18.4232\nCup Catch 548.4413\u00b135.6197 652.2427\u00b137.5175 783.3987\u00b154.1554\nReacher Easy 871.8760\u00b110.4746 872 .0493\u00b19.5175 862 .8973\u00b18.1286\nFinger Spin 564.7493\u00b131.3898 578.9867\u00b131.7433 623.6027\u00b121.5528\nTable 4: Mean and standard-error of \ufb01nal performance for the comparison of VRKN(with and without\nMonte Carlo Dropout) and RSSMon all tasks considered for the PlaNet-agents.\n02004006008001,000Expected ReturnCheetah Run\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMWalker Walk Cartpole Swingup Cup Catch\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.002004006008001,000\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Expected ReturnReacher Easy\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Hopper Hop\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Pendulum Swingup\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime Steps (\u00d7106)Walker Run\nFigure18: Comparisonof VRKN(withandwithoutMonteCarloDropout)and RSSMonalltasksconsidered\nfor theDreamer -agents.VRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSM01002003004005006007008009001,000Expected ReturnCheetah Run\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMWalker Walk\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMCartpole Swingup\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMCup Catch\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMReacher Easy\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMHopper Hop\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMPendulum Swingup\nVRKN (no MCD)\nVRKN\nRSSMWalker Run\nFigure 19: Box plots", " Introduction\nDesigning a single uni\ufb01ed model to capture long range dependencies in sequential data across\na diverge range of modalities, such as language, audio, image and video, is a central and\nchallenging problem in sequence modeling.

Many control applications often exhibit tasks with similar but not\nidentical dynamics which can be modeled as a latent variable. We introduce the\nHidden Parameter Recurrent State Space Models (HiP-RSSMs), a framework that\nparametrizes a family of related dynamical systems with a low-dimensional set of\nlatent factors. We present a simple and effective way of learning and performing\ninference over this Gaussian graphical model that avoids approximations like vari-\national inference. We show that HiP-RSSMs outperforms RSSMs and competing\nmulti-task models on several challenging robotic benchmarks both on real-world\nsystems and simulations.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nSystem identification, i.e., learning models of dynamical systems from observed data ( Ljung (1998);\nGevers (2005)), is a key ingredient of model-predictive control (Camacho & Alba (2013)) and\nmodel-based reinforcement learning (RL). State space models (Hamilton (1994); Jordan (2004);\nSch\u00a8on et al. (2011)) (SSMs) provide a principled framework for modelling dynamics. Recently\nthere have been several works that fused SSMs with deep (recurrent) neural networks achieving\nsuperiorresults of multi-step ahead predictions for upto 50 steps of HiP-RSSM\nwith recurrent baselines like RKN(Becker et al., 2019) and LSTM. Inorder to train the recurrent\nmodels for multi step ahead predictions, we removed three-quarters of the observations from the\ntemporal sequence and tasked the models with imputing those missing observations, only based on\nthe knowledge of available actions/control commands, i.e., we train the models to perform action\nconditional future predictions to impute missing observations. The imputation employs the model\nfor multi-step ahead predictions in a convenient way (Shaj et al., 2020). One could instead also go\nfor a dedicated multi-step loss function as in approaches like Finn et al.

[8]showed that naive instantiations of the SSM do not perform well, and instead relied on a\nparticular (real-valued) matrix Acalled the HiPPO-LegS matrix (4).1These matrices were derived so that\nthe basis kernels Kn(t) have closed-form formulas Ln(e\u0000t), whereLn(t) are normalized Legendre polynomials.\nConsequently, the SSM has a mathematical interpretation of decomposing the input signal u(t) onto a set of\nin\fnitely-long basis functions that are orthogonal respect to an exponentially-decaying measure, giving it\nlong-range modeling abilities [10].\nSecond, S4 introduced a particular parameterization that decomposed this Amatrix into the sum of a normal\nand rank-1 matrix (5), which can be unitarily conjugated into a (complex) diagonal plus rank-1 matrix.\nLeveraging this structured form, they then introduced a sophisticated algorithm for e\u000eciently computing\nthe convolution kernel (2) for state matrices that are diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR) .\nAnk=\u00008\n><\n>:(2n+ 1)1\n2(2k+ 1)1\n2n>k\nn+ 1 n=k\n0 n<k\nBn= (2n+ 1)1\n2Pn= (n+ 1=2)1\n2\n(HiPPO-LegS matrix used in S4 )(4)A(N)\nnk=\u00008\n><\n>:(n+1\n2)1=2(k+1\n2)1=2n>k\n1\n2n=k\n(n+1\n2)1=2(k+1\n2)1=2n<k\nA=A(N)\u0000PP>;A(D):= eig(A(N))\n(Normal / diagonal plus low-rank form )(5)\nDSS: Diagonal State Spaces S4 was originally motivated by searching for a diagonal state matrix , which\nwould be even", " Introduction\nA wide range of modern arti\ufb01cial intelligence challenges ca n be cast as Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) problems under partial observability , in which agents learn to make a sequence of decisions\ndespitelacking complete information abouttheunderlying state of system. For example, in robotics\nthe agent has to cope with noisy sensors, occlusions, and unk nown dynamics ( Akkaya et al. ,2019),\nwhile in imperfect information games the player makes only l ocal observations ( Vinyals et al. ,2019;\nBrown and Sandholm ,2019). Further applications of partially observable RL include autonomous\ndriving ( Levinson et al. ,2011), resource allocation ( Bower and Gilbert ,2005), medical diagnostic\nsystems ( Hauskrecht and Fraser ,2000), recommendation ( Li et al.,2010), business management\n(De Brito and Van Der Laan ,2009), etc. As such, learning and acting under partial observabi lity\nhas been an important topic in operation research, control, and machine learning.\nBecause of the non-Markovian nature of the observations, le arning and planning in partially\nobservable environments requires an agent to maintain memory and possibly reason about be-\nliefsover the states, all while exploring to collect information about the environment. As such,\npartial observability can signi\ufb01cantly complicate learni ng and planning under uncertainty. While\npractical RL systems have succeeded in a set of partially obs ervable problems including Poker\n(Brown and Sandholm ,2019), Starcraft( Vinyals et al. ,2019)andcertainrobotictasks( Cassandra et al. ,\n\u2217The author emails are {qinghual, alan.chung, chij }@princeton.edu andszepesva@ualberta.ca\n11996), the theoretical understanding of learning to act in parti ally observable systems remains lim-\nited.

A key problem is developing architectures for modeling waveforms with the\nfollowing properties:\n1.Globally coherent generation, which requires modeling unbounded contexts with long-range depen-\ndencies.\n2.Computational e\u000eciency through parallel training, and fast autoregressive and non-autoregressive\ninference.\n3.Sample e\u000eciency through a model with inductive biases well suited to high-rate waveform data.\nAmong the many training methods, we sequentially inspect the samples and reject any that are noise-like.\nWe also remove samples that mostly consist of silences (de\fned as more than half the clip being silence).\nWe carry out this process until we have 30 samples per method.\n\u2022Next, we randomly sample 25 clips from the dataset. Since this evaluation is quite subjective, we\ninclude some gold standard samples. We add 4 clips that consist mostly of noise (and should have\nmusicality and quality MOS <= 2). We include 1 clip that has variable quality but musicality MOS\n<= 2. Any workers who disagree with this assessment have their responses omitted from the \fnal\nevaluation.\n\u2022We construct 30 batches, where each batch consists of 1 sample per method (plus a single sample for the\ndataset), presented in random order to a crowdworker. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk for collecting\nresponses, paying $0 :50 per batch and collecting 20 responses per batch. We use Master quali\fcations\nfor workers, and restrict to workers with a HIT approval rating above 98%. We note that it is likely\nenough to collect 10 responses per batch.\n21Figure 6: (YouTubeMix MOS Interface) Crowdsourcing interface for collecting mean opinion scores\n(MOS) on YouTubeMix.

They are asked to rate each \fle on audio \fdelity and musicality.\nFigure 7: (SC09 MOS Interface) Crowdsourcing interface for collecting mean opinion scores (MOS) on\nSC09.

At the bottom, they provide a single score on the audio\nquality and speaker diversity they perceive for the batch.\n22C.4.2 Mean Opinion Scores for SC09\nNext, we outline the protocol used for collecting MOS scores on SC09. We collect MOS scores on digit\nintelligibility, audio quality and speaker diversity, as well as asking crowdworkers to classify digits following\nDonahue et al. [10]. The instructions and interface used are shown in Figure 7.\n\u2022For each method, we generate 2048 samples of 1s each. For autoregressive models ( SaShiMi , SampleRNN,\nWaveNet), we directly sample from the distribution output by the model at each time step, without\nany modi\fcation. For WaveGAN, we obtained 50000 randomly generated samples from the authors,\nand subsampled 2048 samples randomly from this set.

Real-world time-series data often requires reasoning over tens of thousands of time steps, while few\nsequence models address even thousands of time steps. For instance, Background: State Spaces\nSections 2.1 to 2.4 describe the four properties of SSMs in Fig. 1: the classic continuous-time representation,\naddressing LRDs with the HiPPO framework, the discrete-time recurrent representation, and the parallelizable\nconvolution representation. In particular, Section 2.4 introduces the SSM convolution kernel K, which is the\nfocus of our theoretical contributions in Section 3.\n2.1 State Space Models: A Continuous-time Latent State Model\nThe state space model is de\fned by the simple equation (1). It maps a 1-D input signal u(t) to anN-D\nlatent state x(t) before projecting to a 1-D output signal y(t).\nx0(t) =Ax(t) +Bu(t)\ny(t) =Cx(t) +Du(t)(1)\nSSMs are broadly used in many scienti\fc disciplines and related to latent state models such as Hidden Markov\nModels (HMM). Our goal is to simply use the SSM as a black-box representation in a deep sequence model,\nwhere A;B;C;Dare parameters learned by gradient descent. For the remainder of this paper, we will omit\nthe parameter Dfor exposition (or equivalently, assume D= 0) because the term Ducan be viewed as a\nskip connection and is easy to compute.\n2.2 Addressing Long-Range Dependencies with HiPPO\nPrior work found that the basic SSM (1)actually performs very poorly in practice. Intuitively, one explanation\nis that linear \frst-order ODEs solve to an exponential function, and thus may su\u000ber from gradients scaling\nexponentially in the sequence length (i.e., the vanishing/exploding gradients problem [ 32]). To address this\n3problem, the LSSL leveraged the HiPPO theory of continuous-time memorization [ 16]. HiPPO speci\fes a\nclass of certain matrices A2 RN\u0002Nthat when incorporated into (1), allows the state x(t) to memorize the\nhistory of the input u(t). The most important matrix in this class is de\fned by equation (2), which we will\ncall the HiPPO matrix. For example, the LSSL found that simply modifying an SSM from a random matrix\nAto equation (2) improved its performance on the sequential MNIST benchmark from 60% to 98%.\n(HiPPO Matrix )Ank=\u00008\n><\n>:(2n+ 1)1=2(2k+ 1)1=2ifn>k\nn+ 1 if n=k\n0 if n<k: (2)\n2.3 Discrete-time SSM: The Recurrent Representation\nTo be applied on a discrete input sequence ( u0;u1;:::) instead of continuous function u(t),(1)must be\ndiscretized by a step size \u0001 that represents the resolution of the input. Conceptually, the inputs ukcan be\nviewed as sampling an implicit underlying continuous signal u(t), whereuk=u(k\u0001).\nTo discretize the continuous-time SSM, we follow prior work in using the bilinear method [ 43], which converts\nthe state matrix Ainto an approximation A. The discrete SSM is\nxk=Axk\u00001+BukA= (I\u0000\u0001=2\u0001A)\u00001(I+ \u0001=2\u0001A)\nyk=Cxk B= (I\u0000\u0001=2\u0001A)\u00001\u0001B C=C:(3)\nEquation (3)is now a sequence-to-sequence mapuk7!ykinstead of function-to-function. Moreover the state\nequation is now a recurrence in xk, allowing the discrete SSM to be computed like an RNN. Concretely,\nxk2 RNcan be viewed as a hidden state with transition matrix A.\nNotationally, throughout this paper we use A;B;:::to denote discretized SSM matrices de\fned by (3).\nNote that these matrices are a function of both Aas well as a step size \u0001; we suppress this dependence for\nnotational convenience when it is clear.\n2.4 Training SSMs: The Convolutional Representation\nThe recurrent SSM (3)is not practical for training on modern", " Introduction\nReinforcement learning (RL) is typically cast as a problem\nof learning a single fully observable task (an MDP), training\nand testing on that same task.

In Advances", " Introduction\nDynamics models are an integral part of many control architectures. Depending on the control\napproach, the control law relies either on a forward model, mapping from control input to the change\nof system state, or on an inverse model, mapping from the change of the system state to control\nsignals. However, analytical dynamics models are either not available or often too inaccurate in\nsituations such as robots driven by hydraulics, arti\ufb01cial muscles, or robots dealing with unknown\ncontact situations. Hence, there is a signi\ufb01cant need for data-driven approaches that can deal with\nsuch complex systems. Yet, modelling dynamics is a challenging task due to the inherent hysteresis\neffects, unmodelled friction and stiction phenomena, and unknown properties of the interacting\nobjects. Additional challenges for modelling are given by the high data frequency, often up to\n1kHz. Furthermore, many modern model-based architectures [1][2] for learning controllers rely on\nuncertainty estimates of the prediction. Hence, such probabilistic modelling ability is another point\non the desiderata for model learning algorithms.\nCorrespondence to Vaisakh Shaj <v.shaj@kit.edu >\n4th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2020), Cambridge MA, USA.arXiv:2010.10201v2  [cs.RO]  5 Nov 2020In this paper, we extend a recent recurrent neural network architecture [3], called Recurrent Kalman\nNetworks (RKN), for learning forward and inverse dynamics models. The RKN provides probabilis-\ntic predictions of future states, can deal with noisy, high dimensional and missing inputs, and has\nbeen shown to outperform Long-Short Term-Memory Networks (LSTMs)[4] and Gated Recurrent\nUnits (GRUs) [5] on many state estimation tasks. The authors [3] focussed on estimating the state\nof the system from images. We adapt the RKN architecture for prediction instead of \ufb01ltering and\nemploy it for learning robot forward and inverse dynamics. In this scenario, the observations are\ntypically low dimensional, i.e., positions and velocities of the joints of the robot, but occur with a\nmuch higher frequency. Unlike original RKN, we explicitly model the control actions in our archi-\ntecture. We modify the model of the latent transition dynamics using an action dependent non-linear\nadditive factor in order to condition them with action variables. We call this architecture action-\nconditional RKN (ac-RKN) and show that our approach is more accurate than competing learning methods. This highly precise\nmodelling is often a requirement for high \ufb01delity and compliant robotic control.\n7RBD FFNN LSTM ac_RKN101\n4\u00d7102\n6\u00d7102\n2\u00d7101\n3\u00d7101\nRMSE(a) Franka Panda\nFFNN LSTM ac_RKN101\n100 (b) Barret WAM\nPanda Barrett WAM0.040.060.080.100.12No Feedback\nAction Feedback (c) Action Feedback\nFigure 6: (a)and(b)Joint torque prediction RMSE values in NM of Action-Conditional RKN,\nLSTM and FFNN for Panda and Barret WAM.

As seen in the", " Introduction\nModeling and learning from sequential data is a fundamental problem in modern machine learning, underlying\ntasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, video processing, and reinforcement learning. A core\naspect of modeling long-term and complex temporal dependencies is memory, or storing and incorporating\ninformation from previous time steps. The challenge is learning a representation of the entire cumulative\nhistory using bounded storage, which must be updated online as more data is received.\nOne established approach is to model a state that evolves over time as it incorporates more information.\nThe deep learning instantiation of this approach is the recurrent neural network (RNN), which is known to\nsu\ufb00er from a limited memory horizon [ 34,38,56] (e.g., the \u201cvanishing gradients\u201d problem). Although various\nheuristics have been proposed to overcome this, such as gates in the successful LSTM and GRU [16, 34], or\nhigher-order frequencies in the recent Fourier Recurrent Unit [ 79] and Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) [ 71], a\nuni\ufb01ed understanding of memory remains a challenge. Furthermore, existing methods. The table reports\n\ufb01nal normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE)r\nE[(Y\u0000^Y)2]\nE[Y2]between the targets Yand predictions ^Y.\nHiPPO-LegS outperforms the LSTM, LMU, and the best hybrid LSTM+LMU model from [68], reducing\nnormalized MSE by over 30%.\nF.8 Additional Analysis and Ablations of HiPPO\nTo further analyze the tradeo\ufb00s of the memory updates derived from our framework, in Fig. 9 we plot a simple\ninput function f(x) = 1=4sinx+ 1=2sin(x=3) +sin(x=7)to be approximated. The function is subsampled on\nthe rangex2[0;100], creating a sequence of length 1000. This function is simpler than the functions sampled\nfrom white noise signals described in experiments use PyTorch 1.5 and are run on a Nvidia P100 GPU.\nF.2 Permuted MNIST\nTaskThe input to the sequential MNIST (sMNIST) task [ 47] is an MNIST source image, \ufb02attened in\nrow-major order into a single sequence of length 784. The goal of the model is to process the entire image\nsequentially before outputting a classi\ufb01cation label, requiring learning long-term dependencies. A variant of\nthis, the permuted MNIST (pMNIST) task, applies a \ufb01xed permutation to every image, breaking locality and\nfurther straining a model\u2019s capacity for long-term dependencies.\nModels are trained using the cross-entropy loss. We use the standard train-test split (60,000 examples for\ntraining and 10,000 for testing), and further split the training set with 10% to be used as validation set.\n41Baselines and Ablations Table 1 is duplicated here in Tables 4 and 5, with more complete baselines and\nhyperparameter ablations.\nTable 4 consists of our implementations of various baselines related to our method, described in Ap-\npendix F.1. Each method was ran for 3 seeds, and the maximum average validation accuracy is reported.\nAll results than reported in Voelker\net al.[71](possibly due to a larger hidden size).

MBRL techniques achieve the state of the art perfor-\nmance for continuous-control problems with access to a limited number of trials (Chua et al., 2018;\nWang and Ba, 2019) and in controlling systems given only visual observations with no observations\nof the original system\u2019s state (Hafner et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). MBRL approaches typically\nlearn a forward dynamics model that predicts how the dynamical system will evolve when a set of\ncontrol signals are applied. This model is classically \ufb01t with respect to the maximum likelihood of\na set of trajectories collected on the real system, and then used as part of a control algorithm to be\nexecuted on the system (e.g., model-predictive control).\nIn this paper, we highlight a fundamental problem in the MBRL learning scheme: the objective\nmismatch issue.

(2018), and implement all other functions as three dense\nlayers of size 300with ELU activations (Clevert et al., 2015). Distributions in latent space are\n30-dimensional diagonal Gaussians. The action model outputs a tanh mean scaled by a factor of\n5 and a softplus standard deviation for the Normal distribution that is then transformed using tanh\n(Haarnoja et al., 2018). The scaling factor allows the agent to saturate the action distribution.\nLearning updates We draw batches of 50 sequences of length 50 to train the world model, value\nmodel, and action model models using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with learning rates 6\u000210\u00004,\n8\u000210\u00005,8\u000210\u00005, respectively and scale down gradient norms that exceed 100. We do not scale\nthe KL regularizers ( \f= 1) but clip them below 3free nats as in PlaNet. The imagination horizon is\nH= 15 and the same trajectories are used to update both action and value models. We compute the\nV\u0015targets with \r= 0:99and\u0015= 0:95. We did not \ufb01nd latent overshooting for learning the model,\nan entropy bonus for the action model, or target networks for the value model necessary.\nEnvironment interaction The dataset is initialized with S= 5episodes collected using random\nactions. We iterate between 100training steps and collecting 1episode by executing the predicted\nmode action with Normal(0;0:3)exploration noise. Instead of manually selecting the action repeat\nfor each environment as in Hafner et al. (2018) and Lee et al. (2019), we \ufb01x it to 2 for all environments.\nSee Figure 12 for an assessment of the robustness to different action repeat values.\nDiscrete control For", " Introduction\nWith the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine\nlearning tools. Many popular frameworks such as Caffe [ 1], CNTK [ 2], TensorFlow [ 3], and\nTheano [ 4], construct a static data\ufb02ow graph that represents the computation and which can then be\napplied repeatedly to batches of data. This approach provides visibility into the whole computation\nahead of time, and can theoretically be leveraged to improve performance and scalability. However, it\ncomes at the cost of ease of use, ease of debugging, and \ufb02exibility of the types of computation that\ncan be represented.\nPrior work has recognized the value of dynamic eager execution for deep learning, and some recent\nframeworks implement this de\ufb01ne-by-run approach, but do so either at the cost of performance\n(Chainer [ 5]) or using a less expressive, faster language (Torch [ 6], DyNet [ 7]), which limits their\napplicability.\nHowever, with careful implementation and design choices, dynamic eager execution can be achieved\nlargely without sacri\ufb01cing performance. This paper introduces PyTorch, a Python library that\nperforms immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and\nGPU acceleration, and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current\nlibraries for deep learning. This combination has turned out to be very popular in the research\ncommunity with, for instance, 296 ICLR 2019 submissions mentioning PyTorch.\n2 Background\nFour major trends in scienti\ufb01c computing have become increasingly important for deep learning.\nFirst, starting in the 1960s, the development of domain speci\ufb01c languages such as APL [ 8], MATLAB\n[9], R [ 10] and Julia [ 11], turned multidimensional arrays (often referred to as tensors) into \ufb01rst-class\nobjects supported by a comprehensive set of mathematical primitives (or operators) to manipulate\nthem. Separately, libraries such as NumPy[ 12], Torch[ 6], Eigen[ 13] and Lush[ 14] made array-based\nprogramming productive in general purpose languages such as Python, Lisp, C++ and Lua.\nSecond, the development of automatic differentiation [15] made it possible to fully automate\nthe daunting labor of computing derivatives. This made it signi\ufb01cantly easier to experiment with\ndifferent machine learning approaches while still allowing for ef\ufb01cient gradient based optimization.\nThe autograd [ 16] package popularized the use of this technique for NumPy arrays, and similar\napproaches are used in frameworks such as Chainer [ 5], DyNet [ 7], Lush [ 14], Torch [ 6], Jax [ 17]\nand Flux.jl [18].\nThird, with the advent of the free software movement, the scienti\ufb01c community moved away from\nclosed proprietary software such as Matlab[ 9], and towards the open-source Python ecosystem\nwith packages like NumPy [ 12], SciPy [ 19], and Pandas [ 20]. This ful\ufb01lled most of the numerical\nanalysis needs of researchers while allowing them to take advantage of a vast repository of libraries\nto handle dataset preprocessing, statistical analysis, plotting, and more. Moreover, the openness,\ninteroperability, and \ufb02exibility of free software fostered the development of vibrant communities that\ncould quickly address new or changing needs by extending the existing functionality of a library or if\nneeded by developing and releasing brand new ones. While there is a rich offering of open-source\nsoftware for neural networks in languages other than Python, starting with Lush [ 14] in Lisp, Torch [ 6]\nin C++, Objective-C and Lua, EBLearn [ 21] in C++, Caffe", " Introduction\nHumans use memory to reason, imagine, plan, and learn. Memory is a foundational component of\nintelligence, and enables information from past events and contexts to inform decision-making in the\npresent and future. Recently, agents that utilize memory systems have advanced the state of the art\nin various research areas including reasoning, planning, program execution and navigation, among\nothers (Graves et al., 2016; Zambaldi et al., 2018; Santoro et al., 2018; Banino et al., 2018; Vaswani\net al., 2017; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015).\nMemory has many aspects, and having access to different kinds allows intelligent organisms to\nbring the most relevant past information to bear on different sets of circumstances. In cognitive\npsychology and neuroscience, two commonly studied types of memory are working and episodic\nmemory. Working memory (Miyake and Shah, 1999) is a short-term temporary store with limited\ncapacity.\nIn contrast, episodic memory (Tulving and Murray, 1985) is typically a larger autobiographical\ndatabase of experience (e.g. recalling a meal eaten last month) that lets one store information over a\nlonger time scale and compile sequences of events into episodes (Tulving, 2002). Episodic memory\nhas been shown to help reinforcement learning agents adapt more quickly and thereby boost data\n1https://github.com/deepmind/dm_memorytasks. Videos available at https://sites.google.com/view/memory-\ntasks-suite\n33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.arXiv:1910.13406v2  [cs.LG]  19 Feb 2020ef\ufb01ciency (Blundell et al., 2016; Pritzel et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2018). More recently, Ritter et al.\n(2018) shows how episodic memory can be used to provide agents with context-switching abilities\nin contextual bandit problems. The transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) can be viewed as a hybrid\nof working memory and episodic memory that has been successfully applied to many supervised\nlearning problems.\nIn this work, we explore adding such memory systems to agents and propose a consistent and rigorous\napproach for evaluating whether an agent demonstrates generalization-enabling memory capabilities\nsimilar to those seen in animals and humans.\nOne fundamental principle in machine learning is to train on one set of data and test on an unseen\nholdout set, but it has to date been common in reinforcement learning to evaluate agent performance\nsolely on the training set which is suboptimal for testing generalization (Pineau, 2018). Also, though\nadvances have recently been made on evaluating generalization in reinforcement learning (Cobbe\net al., 2018) these have not been speci\ufb01c to memory.\nOur approach is to construct a train-holdout split where the holdout set differs from the training set\nalong axes that we propose are relevant speci\ufb01cally to memory, i.e. the scale of the task and precise\nobjects used in the task environments. For instance, if an agent learns in training to travel to an apple\nplaced in a room, altering the room size or apple color as part of a generalization test should ideally\nnot throw it off.\nWe propose a set of environments that possess such a split and test different aspects of working and\nepisodic memory, to help us better understand when different kinds of memory systems are most\nhelpful and identify memory architectures in agents with memory abilities that cognitive scientists\nand psychologists have observed in humans.\nAlongside these tasks, we develop a benchmark memory-based agent, the Memory Recall Agent\n(MRA), that brings together previously developed systems thought to mimic working memory and\nepisodic memory. This combination of a", " Introduction\nHow to train deep neural networks ef\ufb01ciently is a long-standing challenge. To accelerate model\nconvergence, Ba et al. [3]propose the layer normalization (LayerNorm) which stabilizes the training\nof deep neural networks by regularizing neuron dynamics within one layer via mean and variance\nstatistics. Due to its simplicity and requiring no dependencies among training cases, LayerNorm\nhas been widely applied to different neural architectures, which enables remarkable success on\nvarious tasks ranging from computer vision [ 19,26], speech recognition [ 37] to natural language\nprocessing [ 31,35]. In some cases, LayerNorm was found to be essential for successfully training a\nmodel [ 6]. Besides, the decoupling from batch-based samples endows LayerNorm with the superiority\nover batch normalization (BatchNorm) [12] in handling variable-length sequences using RNNs.\nUnfortunately, the incorporation of LayerNorm raises computational overhead. Although this is\nnegligible to small and shallow neural models with few normalization layers, this problem becomes\nsevere when underlying networks grow larger and deeper. As a result, the ef\ufb01ciency gain from\nfaster and more stable training (in terms of number of training steps) is counter-balanced by an\nincreased computational cost per training step, which diminishes the net ef\ufb01ciency, as show in Figure\n1. One major feature of LayerNorm that is widely regarded as contributions to the stabilization is its\nre-centering invariance property: the summed inputs after LayerNorm remain intact when the inputs\nor weight matrix is shifted by some amount of noise. We argue that this mean normalization does not\nreduce the variance of hidden states or model gradients, and hypothesize that it has little impact on\nthe success of LayerNorm.\nIn this paper, we propose root mean square layer normalization (RMSNorm), which regularizes\nthe summed inputs to a neuron in one layer with the root mean square (RMS) statistic alone.\n33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.arXiv:1910.07467v1  [cs.LG]  16 Oct 20190 20 40 60 80 100\nTraining Step (x 100)45678910Loss7.0\n5.4Baseline\nLayerNorm(a) Training loss vs. training steps.\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\nTraining Time (in minutes)45678910Loss7.0\n5.9Baseline\nLayerNorm (b) Training loss vs. training time.\nFigure 1: Training procedure of a GRU-based RNNSearch [ 4] for the \ufb01rst 10k training steps. Baseline means the\noriginal model without any normalization. When the Baseline training loss arrives at 7.0, the loss of LayerNorm\nreaches 5.4 after the same number of training steps 1(a), but only 5.9 after the same training time 1(b).\nRMSNorm reduces the amount of computation and increases ef\ufb01ciency over LayerNorm. Despite the\nsimpler formulation, the RMS normalizer helps stabilize the magnitude of layer activations, ensuring\ninvariance to the re-scaling of both weights and datasets. We also show the possibility of estimating\nRMS on a subset of the summed inputs, maintaining this invariance property. Assuming that the\nsummed inputs have an independent identically distributed structure, we propose partial RMSNorm,\nwhere only the \ufb01rst p% summed inputs are utilized for RMS estimation.\nWe thoroughly examine our model on various tasks, including machine translation, image classi\ufb01ca-\ntion, image-caption retrieval and question answering.

(2017) see as a \u201ddominant concern in RL\u201d.\nHaarnoja et al. (2018) provide the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm which helps deal with this concern in continuous\naction settings. It has achieved model-free state-of-the-art sample ef\ufb01ciency in multiple challenging continuous control\ndomains. Many domains however involve discrete rather than continuous actions and in these environments SAC is not\ncurrently applicable. This paper derives a version of SAC that is applicable to discrete action domains and then shows\nthat it is competitive with the model-free state-of-the-art for discrete action domains in terms of sample ef\ufb01ciency on a\nselection of games from the Atari [Bellemare et al., 2013] suite.\nWe proceed as follows: \ufb01rst we explain the derivation of Soft Actor-Critic for continuous action settings found in\nHaarnoja et al. (2018) and Haarnoja et al. (2019), then we derive and explain the changes required to create a discrete\naction version of the algorithm, and \ufb01nally we test the discrete action algorithm on the Atari suite.\n2 Soft Actor-Critic\nSoft Actor-Critic [Haarnoja et al., 2018] attempts to \ufb01nd a policy that maximises the maximum entropy objective:\n\u0019\u0003= argmax\n\u0019TX\nt=0E(st;at)\u0018\u001c\u0019[\rt(r(st;at) +\u000bH(\u0019(:jst))] (1)\nwhere\u0019is a policy,\u0019\u0003is the optimal policy, Tis the number of timesteps, r:S\u0002A!Ris the reward function,\n\r2[0;1]is the discount rate, st2Sis the state at timestep t, at2Ais the action at timestep t, \u001c\u0019is the distribution\nof trajectories induced by policy \u0019,\u000bdetermines the relative importance of the entropy term versus the reward and\nis called the temperature parameter, and H(\u0019(:jst)is the entropy of the policy \u0019at statestand is calculated as\nH(\u0019(:jst)) =\u0000log\u0019(:jst).\nTo maximise the objective the authors use soft policy iteration which is a method of alternating between policy evaluation\nand policy improvement within the maximum entropy framework.arXiv:1910.07207v2  [cs.LG]  18 Oct 2019The policy evaluation step involves computing the value of policy \u0019. To do this they \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the soft state value\nfunction as:\nV(st):=Eat\u0018\u0019[Q(st;at)\u0000\u000blog(\u0019(atjst))] (2)\nThey then prove that in a tabular setting (i.e. when the state space is discrete) we can obtain the soft q-function by\nstarting from a randomly initialised function Q:S\u0002A!Rand repeatedly applying the modi\ufb01ed Bellman backup\noperatorT\u0019given by:\nT\u0019Q(st;at):=r(st;at) +\rEst+1\u0018p(st;at)[V(st+1)] (3)\nwherep:S\u0002A!Sgives the distribution over the next state given the current state and action.\nIn the continuous state (instead of tabular) setting they explain that we instead \ufb01rstly parameterise the soft q-function\nQ\u0012(st;at)using a neural network with parameters \u0012. Then we train the soft Q-function to minimise the soft Bellman\nresidual:\nJQ(\u0012) =E(st;at)\u0018D[1\n2(Q\u0012(st;at)\u0000(r(st;at) +\rEst+1\u0018p(st;at)[V\u0016\u0012(st+1)]))2] (4)\nwhere D is a replay buffer of past experiences and V\u0016\u0012(st+1)is estimated using a target network for Qand a monte-carlo\nestimate of (2) after sampling experiences from the replay buffer .\nThe policy improvement step then involves updating the policy in a direction that maximises the rewards it will achieve.\nTo do this they use the soft Q-function calculated in the policy evaluation step to guide changes to the policy. Speci\ufb01cally,\nthey update the policy towards the exponential of the new soft Q-function.", " INTRODUCTION\nParallel computing is rapidly transforming from a scientists\u2019\ncomputational tool to a general purpose computational paradigm.\nThe availability of affordable massively-parallel graphics processing\nunits (GPUs) as well as widely-available parallel grid and cloud\ncomputing systems [1]\u2013[3] drive this transformation by bringing\nparallel computing technology to everyday use. This creates a demand\nfor parallel algorithms that can harness the full power of the parallel\ncomputing hardware.\nStochastic state-space models allow for modeling of time-\nbehaviour and uncertainties of dynamic systems, and they have long\nbeen used in various tracking, automation, communications, and\nimaging applications [4]\u2013[8].

N UMERICAL EXPERIMENT\nIn order to illustrate", " Introduction\nState-estimation in unstructured environments is a very chal-\nlenging task as observations or measurements of the envi-\nronment are often high-dimensional and only provide partial\ninformation about the state. Images are a good example:\nEven for low resolution, the number of pixels can quickly\nexceed tens or hundreds of thousands and it is impossible\nto obtain any information about the dynamics, such as ve-\nlocities, from a single image. Additionally, the observations\nmay be noisy or may not contain useful information for the\ntask at hand. Such noise can, for example, be introduced by\npoor illumination or motion blur and occlusions can prevent\nus from observing some or all relevant aspects of the scene.\nIn addition to state estimation, it is also often desirable to\npredict future states or observations, for example, in order\nto assess the consequences of future actions. To this end, an\ninitial estimate of the current state is necessary which again\nhas to be inferred from observations. In such environments,\nwe typically also have to deal with high uncertainties in\nthe state estimates. Being able to model this uncertainty\nis crucial in many decision making scenarios, e.g., if we\nneed to decide to perform an action now or wait until more\ninformation about the scene is available.\nDeep learning models have been very successful for time-\nseries modelling in unstructured environments. Classical\nmodels such as LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)\nor GRUs (Cho et al., 2014) perform well but fail to capture\nthe uncertainty of the state estimate. Recent probabilistic\ndeep learning approaches have used the Kalman Filter (KF)\nas a tool to integrate uncertainty estimates into deep time-\nseries modelling (Haarnoja et al., 2016; Watter et al., 2015;\nArcher et al., 2015; Fraccaro et al., 2017; Krishnan et al.,\n2017). These approaches use the KF to perform inference\nin a low-dimensional (latent) state space that is typically\nde\ufb01ned by a deep encoder. However, using KF in such a\nstate space comes with two main limitations. In order to\nbe usable for non-linear dynamics, we have to introduce\napproximations such as the extended KF (Haarnoja et al.,\n2016) and variational inference methods. We also computed the quality of\nthe uncertainty prediction by showing the histograms ofRecurrent Kalman Networks: Factorized Inference in High-Dimensional Deep Feature Spaces\nTable 4. Related Work\nUsing encoders for time-series modelling of high-\ndimensional data such as images is a common approach.\nSuch encoders can also be easily integrated with well known\ndeep time-series models such as LSTMs (Hochreiter &\nSchmidhuber, 1997) or GRUs (Cho et al., 2014).

More\nimportantly, the maximum entropy formulation provides a substantial improvement in exploration\nand robustness: as discussed by Ziebart (2010), maximum entropy policies are robust in the face of\nmodel and estimation errors, and as demonstrated by (Haarnoja et al., 2017), they improve exploration\nby acquiring diverse behaviors.

First, model-based plan-\nning can be more data ef\ufb01cient because it leverages a richer\ntraining signal and does not require propagating rewards\nthrough Bellman backups. Moreover, planning carries the\npromise of increasing performance just by increasing the\ncomputational budget for searching for actions, as shown\nby Silver et al. (2017). Finally, learned dynamics can be\nindependent of any speci\ufb01c task and thus have the potential\nto transfer well to other tasks in the environment.\nRecent work has shown promise in learning the dynamics of\nsimple low-dimensional environments (Deisenroth & Ras-\nmussen, 2011; Gal et al., 2016; Amos et al., 2018; Chua\net al., 2018; Henaff et al., 2018). However, these approaches\ntypically assume access to the underlying state of the world\nand the reward function, which may not be available in prac-\ntice. In high-dimensional environments, we would like to\nlearn the dynamics in a compact latent space to enable fast\nplanning. The success of such latent models has previously\nbeen limited to simple tasks such as balancing cartpoles and\ncontrolling 2-link arms from dense rewards (Watter et al.,\n2015; Banijamali et al., 2017).\nIn this paper, we propose the Deep Planning Network\n(PlaNet), a model-based agent that learns the environment\ndynamics from pixels and chooses actions through online\nplanning in a compact latent space. To learn the dynamics,\nwe use a transition model with both stochastic and determin-\nistic components. Moreover, we experiment with a novel\ngeneralized variational objective that encourages multi-step\npredictions. PlaNet solves continuous control tasks from\npixels that are more dif\ufb01cult than those previously solved\nby planning with learned models.\nKey contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\u000fPlanning in latent spaces We solve a variety of tasks\nfrom the DeepMind control suite, shown in Figure 1, by\nlearning a dynamics model and ef\ufb01ciently planning inarXiv:1811.04551v5  [cs.LG]  4 Jun 2019Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels\n(a) Cartpole\n (b) Reacher\n (c) Cheetah\n (d) Finger\n (e) Cup\n (f) Walker\nFigure 1: Image-based control domains used in our experiments above.

Let\u0019ibe the policy at iteration i. By Lemma 2, the sequence Q\u0019iis monotonically increasing. Since Q\u0019is bounded\nabove for\u00192\u0005(both the reward and entropy are bounded), the sequence converges to some \u0019\u0003. We will still need to\nshow that\u0019\u0003is indeed optimal. At convergence, it must be case that J\u0019\u0003(\u0019\u0003(\u0001jst))<J\u0019\u0003(\u0019(\u0001jst))for all\u00192\u0005,\u00196=\u0019\u0003.\nUsing the same iterative argument as in the proof of Lemma 2, we get Q\u0019\u0003(st;at)>Q\u0019(st;at)for all (st;at)2S\u0002A ,\nthat is, the soft value of any other policy in \u0005is lower than that of the converged policy. Hence \u0019\u0003is optimal in \u0005.\nC. Enforcing Action Bounds\nWe use an unbounded Gaussian as the action distribution. However, in practice, the actions needs to be bounded to a \ufb01nite\ninterval. To that end, we apply an invertible squashing function ( tanh ) to the Gaussian samples, and employ the change of\nvariables formula to compute the likelihoods of the bounded actions. In the other words, let u2RDbe a random variable\nand\u0016(ujs)the corresponding density with in\ufb01nite support.

(4)\nHere,\u03b8oldis the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can e\ufb03ciently be\napproximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation\nto the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.\nThe theory justifying TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e.,\nsolving the unconstrained optimization problem\nmaximize\n\u03b8\u02c6Et/bracketleftbigg\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|st),\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st)]/bracketrightbigg\n(5)\nfor some coe\ufb03cient \u03b2. This follows from the fact that a certain surrogate objective (which computes\nthe max KL over states instead of the mean) forms a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the\nperformance of the policy \u03c0. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard\nto choose a single value of \u03b2that performs well across di\ufb00erent problems\u2014or even within a single\nproblem, where the the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve our goal\nof a \ufb01rst-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Experiments\n6.1 Comparison of Surrogate Objectives\nFirst, we compare several di\ufb00erent surrogate objectives under di\ufb00erent hyperparameters. Here, we\ncompare the surrogate objective LCLIPto several natural variations and ablated versions.\nNo clipping or penalty: Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\nClipping: Lt(\u03b8) = min(rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At,clip(rt(\u03b8)),1\u2212/epsilon1,1 +/epsilon1)\u02c6At\nKL penalty (\ufb01xed or adaptive) Lt(\u03b8) =rt(\u03b8)\u02c6At\u2212\u03b2KL[\u03c0\u03b8old,\u03c0\u03b8]\n5For the KL penalty, one can either use a \ufb01xed penalty coe\ufb03cient \u03b2or an adaptive coe\ufb03cient as\ndescribed in Section 4 using target KL value dtarg. Note that we also tried clipping in log space,\nbut found the performance to be no better.\nBecause we are searching over hyperparameters for each algorithm variant, we chose a compu-\ntationally cheap benchmark to test the algorithms on. Namely, we used 7 simulated robotics tasks2\nimplemented in OpenAI Gym [Bro+16], which use the MuJoCo [TET12] physics engine. We do\none million timesteps of training on each one. Besides the hyperparameters used for clipping ( /epsilon1)\nand the KL penalty ( \u03b2,dtarg), which we search over, the other hyperparameters are provided in in\nTable 3.\nTo represent the policy, we used a fully-connected MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units,\nand tanh nonlinearities, outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, with variable standard\ndeviations, following [Sch+15b; Dua+16]. We don\u2019t share parameters between the policy and value\nfunction (so coe\ufb03cient c1is irrelevant), and we don\u2019t use an entropy bonus.\nEach algorithm was run on all 7 environments, with 3 random seeds on each. We scored each\nrun of the algorithm by computing the average total reward of the last 100 episodes. We shifted\nand scaled the scores for each environment so that the random policy gave a score of 0 and the best\nresult was set to 1, and averaged over 21 runs to produce a single scalar for each algorithm setting.\nThe Results from continuous control benchmark. Average normalized scores (over 21 runs of the\nalgorithm, on 7 environments) for each algorithm / hyperparameter setting . \u03b2was initialized at 1.\n6.2 Comparison to Other Algorithms in the", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript\u210e\ud835\udc61h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121subscript\u210e\ud835\udc611h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position t\ud835\udc61titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n \n\n2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\u00a03.2.\n\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned", "Abstract \u2014 Two less addressed issues of deep reinforcement\nlearning are (1) lack of generalization capability to new target\ngoals, and (2) data inef\ufb01ciency i.e., the model requires several\n(and often costly) episodes of trial and error to converge, which\nmakes it impractical to be applied to real-world scenarios. In\nthis paper, we address these two issues and apply our model\nto the task of target-driven visual navigation. To address the\n\ufb01rst issue, we propose an actor-critic model whose policy is a\nfunction of the goal as well as the current state, which allows to\nbetter generalize. To address the second issue, we propose AI2-\nTHOR framework, which provides an environment with high-\nquality 3D scenes and physics engine. Our framework enables\nagents to take actions and interact with objects.

This success has been extended to reinforcement\nlearning (RL) problems that involve visual perception. For\nexample, the Deep Q-Network (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015)\narchitecture has been shown to successfully learn to play\nmany Atari 2600 games in the Arcade Learning Environ-\nment (ALE) benchmark (Bellemare et al., 2013) by learn-\ning visual features useful for control directly from raw pix-\nels using Q-Learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992).\nProceedings of the 33rdInternational Conference on Machine\nLearning , New York, NY , USA, 2016.

Most of these\nadvances, however, are restricted to the supervised learn-\ning setting, which provides clear error signals.

Speci\ufb01cally, this paper intro-\nduces a set of tasks in Minecraft1, a \ufb02exible 3D world in\nwhich an agent can collect resources, build structures, and\nsurvive attacks from enemies. Our RL tasks (one exam-\nple is illustrated in Figure 1) not only have the usual RL\nchallenges of partial observability, high-dimensional (vi-\nsual) perception, and delayed reward, but also require an\nagent to develop movement policies by learning how to use\nits active perception to observe useful information and col-\nlect reward. In addition, our RL tasks require an agent to\nlearn to use any memory it possesses including its interac-\ntion with active perception which feeds observations into\n1https://minecraft.net/arXiv:1605.09128v1  [cs.AI]  30 May 2016Control of Memory, Active Perception, and Action in Minecraft\nmemory.

The architectures we\nintroduce use memory mechanisms similar to MemNN, but\nour architectures have a layer that constructs a query for\nmemory retrieval based on temporal context. Our architec-\ntures are also similar to NTM in that a recurrent controller\ninteracts with an external memory, but ours have a simpler\nwriting and addressing mechanism which makes them eas-\nier to train. Most importantly, our architectures are used in\nan RL", " Introduction\nThe use of neural networks for solving continuous control problems has a long tradition. Several\nrecent papers successfully apply model-free, direct policy search methods can roughly be divided into two\nbroad classes:\nOn the one hand there are approaches that explicitly maintain a belief state that corresponds to\nthe distribution over the world state given the observations so far. This approach has two major\ndisadvantages: The \ufb01rst is the need for a model, and the second is the computational cost that is\ntypically associated with the update of the belief state [8, 23].\n1arXiv:1512.04455v1  [cs.LG]  14 Dec 2015On the other hand there are model free approaches that learn to form memories based on interactions\nwith the world. This is challenging since it is a priori unknown which features of the observations\nwill be relevant later, and associations may have to be formed over many steps. For this reason, most\nmodel free approaches tend to assume the fully-observed case. In practice, partial observability is\noften solved by hand-crafting a solution such as providing multiple-frames at each timestep to allow\nvelocity estimation [16, 14].\nIn this work we investigate a natural extension of two recent, closely related policy gradient algo-\nrithms for learning continuous-action policies to handle partially observed problems. We primarily\nconsider the Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DPG) [24], which is an off-policy policy\ngradient algorithm that has recently produced promising results.\n7(a)\n (b)\n (c)\nFigure 4: RDPG was able to learn good policies directly from high-dimensional renderings for\npendulum (a), and a two choice reaching task with a disappearing target (b). (c) Example frame\nfrom the reaching task.\n5 Background\nWe model our environment as discrete-time, partially-observed Markov Decision process (POMDP).\nA POMDP is described a set of environment states Sand a set of actions A, an initial state distribu-\ntionp0(s0), a transition function p(st+1jst;at)and reward function r(st;at). This underlying MDP\nis partially observed when the agent is unable to observe the state stdirectly and instead receives\nobservations from the set Owhich are conditioned on the underlying state p(otjst).\nThe agent only indirectly observes the underlying state of the MDP through the observations. An\noptimal agent may, in principle, require access to the entire history ht= (o1;a1;o2;a2;:::at\u00001;ot).\nThe goal of the agent is thus to learn a policy \u0019(ht)which maps from the history to a distribution over\nactionsP(A)which maximizes the expected discounted reward (below we consider both stochastic\nand deterministic policies). For stochastic policies we want to maximise\nJ=E\u001c\"1X\nt=1\rt\u00001r(st;at)#\n; (1)\nwhere the trajectories \u001c= (s1;o1;a1;s2;:::)are drawn from the trajectory distribution induced by\nthe policy\u0019:p(s1)p(o1js1)\u0019(a1jh1)p(s2js1;a1)p(o2js2)\u0019(a2jh2):::and wherehtis de\ufb01ned as\nabove. For deterministic policies we replace \u0019with a deterministic function \u0016which maps directly\nfrom statesSto actionsAand we replace at\u0018\u0019(\u0001jht)withat=\u0016(ht).\nIn the algorithms below we make use of the action-value function Q\u0019. For a fully observed MDP,\nwhen we have access to s, the action-value function is de\ufb01ned as the expected future discounted\nreward when in state stthe agent takes action atand thereafter follows policy \u0019. Since we are\n2interested in the partially observed case where the agent does not have access to swe instead de\ufb01ne\nQ\u0019in terms ofh:\nQ\u0019(ht;at) =Estjht[rt(st;at)] +E\u001c>tjht;at\"1X\ni=1\rir(st+i;at+i)#\n(2)\nwhere\u001c>t= (st+1;ot+1;at+1:::)is the future trajectory and the two expectations are taken with\nrespect to the conditionals p(stjht)andp(\u001c>tjht;at)of the trajectory distribution associated with\n\u0019. Note that this equivalent to de\ufb01ning Q\u0019in terms of the belief state since", " Introduction . MIT Press.\nTieleman, T., and Hinton, G. 2012.

The targets\nat each timestep are generated from the target Q-network,\n^Q. The RNN\u2019s hidden state is carried forward throughout\nthe episode.\nBootstrapped Random Updates : Episodes are selected\nrandomly from the replay memory and updates begin at ran-\ndom points in the episode and proceed for only unroll itera-\ntions timesteps (e.g. one backward call). The targets at each\ntimestep are generated from the target Q-network, ^Q. The\nRNN\u2019s initial state is zeroed at the start of the update.\nSequential updates have the advantage of carrying the\nLSTM\u2019s hidden state forward from the beginning of the\nepisode. However, by sampling experiences sequentially for\na full episode, they violate DQN\u2019s random sampling policy.Random updates better adhere to the policy of randomly\nsampling experience, but, as a consequence, the LSTM\u2019s\nhidden state must be zeroed at the start of each update. Ze-\nroing the hidden state makes it harder for the LSTM to learn\nfunctions that span longer time scales than the number of\ntimesteps reached by back propagation through time. Experiments used a single\nNvidia GTX Titan Black using CuDNN and a fully opti-\nmized version of Caffe. Appendix C: Flickering Related Work\nPreviously, LSTM networks have been demonstrated to\nsolve POMDPs when trained using policy gradient meth-\nods (Wierstra et al. 2007). In contrast to policy gradient,\nour work uses temporal-difference updates to bootstrap an\naction-value function. Additionally, by jointly training con-\nvolutional and LSTM layers we are able to learn directly\nfrom pixels and do not require hand-engineered features.\nLSTM has been used as an advantage-function approxi-\nmator and shown to solve a partially observable corridor and\ncartpole tasks better better than comparable (non-LSTM)\nRNNs (Bakker 2001). While similar in principle, the cor-\nridor and cartpole tasks feature tiny states spaces with just a\nfew features.\nIn parallel to our work, (Narasimhan, Kulkarni, and Barzi-\nlay 2015) independently combined LSTM with Deep Re-\ninforcement Learning to demonstrate that recurrency helps\nto better play text-based fantasy games. The approach is\nsimilar but the domains differ: despite the apparent com-\nplexity of the fantasy-generated text, the underlying MDPs\nfeature relatively low-dimensional manifolds of underlying\nstate space. The more complex of the two games features\nonly 56 underlying states. Atari games, in contrast, feature\na much richer state space with typical games having mil-\nlions of different states. However, the action space of the text\ngames is much larger with a branching factor of 222 versus\nAtari\u2019s 18. Discussion and Conclusion\nReal-world tasks often feature incomplete", " Introduction\nA new approach for statistical machine transla-\ntion based purely on neural networks has recently\nbeen proposed (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;\nSutskever et al., 2014). This new approach, which\nwe refer to as neural machine translation , is in-\nspired by the recent trend of deep representational\nlearning. All the neural network models used in\n(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et\nal., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) consist of an encoder\nand a decoder. The encoder extracts a \ufb01xed-length\nvector representation from a variable-length input\nsentence, and from this representation the decoder\n\u0003Research done while visiting Universit \u00b4e de Montr \u00b4ealgenerates a correct, variable-length target transla-\ntion.\nThe emergence of the neural machine transla-\ntion is highly signi\ufb01cant, both practically and the-\noretically. Neural machine translation models re-\nquire only a fraction of the memory needed by\ntraditional statistical machine translation (SMT)\nmodels. The models we trained for this paper\nrequire only 500MB of memory in total. This\nstands in stark contrast with existing SMT sys-\ntems, which often require tens of gigabytes of\nmemory. This makes the neural machine trans-\nlation appealing in practice. Furthermore, un-\nlike conventional translation systems, each and ev-\nery component of the neural translation model is\ntrained jointly to maximize the translation perfor-\nmance.\nAs this approach is relatively new, there has not\nbeen much work on analyzing the properties and\nbehavior of these models. For instance: What\nare the properties of sentences on which this ap-\nproach performs better? How does the choice of\nsource/target vocabulary affect the performance?\nIn which cases does the neural machine translation\nfail?\nIt is crucial to understand the properties and be-\nhavior of this new neural machine translation ap-\nproach in order to determine future research di-\nrections. Also, understanding the weaknesses and\nstrengths of neural machine translation might lead\nto better ways of integrating SMT and neural ma-\nchine translation systems.\nIn this paper, we analyze two neural machine\ntranslation models. One of them is the RNN\nEncoder\u2013Decoder that was proposed recently in\n(Cho et al., 2014). The other model replaces the\nencoder in the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder model with\na novel neural network, which we call a gated\nrecursive convolutional neural network (grConv).\nWe evaluate these two models on the task of trans-\nlation from French to English.arXiv:1409.1259v2  [cs.CL]  7 Oct 2014Our analysis shows that the performance of\nthe neural machine translation model degrades\nquickly as the length of a source sentence in-\ncreases. Furthermore, we \ufb01nd that the vocabulary\nsize has a high impact on the translation perfor-\nmance. Nonetheless, qualitatively we \ufb01nd that the\nboth models are able to generate correct transla-\ntions most of the time. Furthermore, the newly\nproposed grConv model is able to learn, without\nsupervision, a kind of syntactic structure over the\nsource language.\n2 Neural Networks for Variable-Length\nSequences\nIn this section, we describe two types of neural\nnetworks that are able to process variable-length\nsequences. These are the recurrent neural net-\nwork and the proposed gated recursive convolu-\ntional neural network.\n2.1 Recurrent Neural Network with Gated\nHidden Neurons\nz\nrh h~x\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1: The graphical illustration of (a) the re-\ncurrent neural network and (b) the hidden unit that\nadaptively forgets and remembers.\nA recurrent neural network (RNN, Fig. 1 (a))\nworks on a variable-length sequence x=\n(x1;x2;\u0001\u0001\u0001;xT)by maintaining a hidden state h\nover time.

The lower table reports Background\nWe consider tasks in which an agent interacts with an environment E, in this case the Atari emulator,\nin a sequence of actions, observations and rewards. At each time-step the agent selects an action\natfrom the set of legal game actions, A=f1;:::;Kg. The action is passed to the emulator and\nmodi\ufb01es its internal state and the game score. In general Emay be stochastic. The emulator\u2019s\ninternal state is not observed by the agent; instead it observes an image xt2Rdfrom the emulator,\nwhich is a vector of raw pixel values representing the current screen. In addition it receives a reward\nrtrepresenting the change in game score. Note that in general the game score may depend on the\nwhole prior sequence of actions and observations; feedback about an action may only be received\nafter many thousands of time-steps have elapsed.\nSince the agent only observes images of the current screen, the task is partially observed and many\nemulator states are perceptually aliased, i.e. it is impossible to fully understand the current situation\nfrom only the current screen xt. We therefore consider sequences of actions and observations, st=\nx1;a1;x2;:::;at\u00001;xt, and learn game strategies that depend upon these sequences. All sequences\nin the emulator are assumed to terminate in a \ufb01nite number of time-steps. This formalism gives\nrise to a large but \ufb01nite Markov decision process (MDP) in which each sequence is a distinct state.\nAs a result, we can apply standard reinforcement learning Related Work\nPerhaps the best-known success story of reinforcement learning is TD-gammon , a backgammon-\nplaying program which learnt entirely by reinforcement learning and self-play, and achieved a super-\nhuman level of play [24]. TD-gammon used a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm similar\nto Q-learning, and approximated the value function using a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden\nlayer1.\nHowever, early attempts to follow up on TD-gammon, including applications of the same method to\nchess, Go and checkers were less successful. This led to a widespread belief that the TD-gammon\napproach was a special case that only worked in backgammon, perhaps because the stochasticity in\nthe dice rolls helps explore the state space and also makes the value function particularly smooth\n[19].\nFurthermore, it was shown that combining model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-\nlearning with non-linear function approximators [25], or indeed with off-policy learning [1] could\ncause the Q-network to diverge. Subsequently, the majority of work in reinforcement learning fo-\ncused on linear function approximators with better convergence guarantees [25].\n1In fact TD-Gammon approximated the state value function V(s)rather than the action-value function\nQ(s; a), and learnt on-policy directly from the self-play games\n3More recently, there has been a revival of interest in combining deep learning with reinforcement\nlearning. Deep neural networks have been used to estimate the environment E; restricted Boltzmann\nmachines have been used to estimate the value function [21]; or the policy [9].

For instance, a small amount of traf\ufb01c can be des-\nignated for such exploration.

Advanced exploration approaches such as EXP3[8]\norUCB1[7] could be applied as well.

{"paper_key": "Research on Predicting Public Opinion Event Heat Levels Based on Large Language Models", "current_5q": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**  \nHow can large language models (LLMs) be effectively utilized to predict the heat levels of public opinion events based on their network dissemination heat index?\n\n---\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**  \nSolving this problem is crucial for the research community as it addresses a significant gap in the application of LLMs to real-world scenarios, particularly in predicting public sentiment and event impact. By advancing our understanding of how LLMs can analyze and predict trends in public opinion, this research could lead to improved methodologies for sentiment analysis, crisis management, and social media monitoring. Furthermore, it could inspire future research into the integration of LLMs with other data sources, enhancing their predictive capabilities and broadening their applicability across various domains.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of accurately predicting heat levels due to the uneven distribution of event data across different heat levels, which can lead to biased predictions. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the contextual nuances of events or the lack of sufficient training data for high-heat events. Additionally, the models must effectively match similar cases to improve prediction accuracy, which requires sophisticated mechanisms for case comparison and contextual understanding. Overcoming these technical and practical obstacles is essential for achieving reliable predictions.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on the application of LLMs in specialized domains without addressing the specific challenge of predicting the influence of trending events. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive datasets that cover a wide range of heat levels and insufficient methodologies for clustering and analyzing public opinion events. Additionally, prior work may not have explored the potential of LLMs in this context, leading to a gap in knowledge. Our approach differs by utilizing a structured methodology that includes automated clustering and a focus on the heat index, which enhances the predictive capabilities of LLMs in this area.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves preprocessing and classifying a dataset of 62,836 trending events in China, using the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm for automated clustering into four heat levels. We will evaluate the performance of various LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V2, in predicting event heat levels under two scenarios: with and without reference cases. The expected outcomes", "proposal_5q": ["[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question this proposal aims to address is: How can a hybrid model that integrates large language models and graph-based frameworks improve real-time sentiment analysis of public opinion by incorporating psychological factors and cultural context?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nThis research is significant as it aims to bridge the gap between advanced natural language processing and network theory to provide a robust framework for understanding public sentiment. As social media continues to be a primary platform for public discourse, accurately capturing sentiment trends can have far-reaching implications in fields such as political science, marketing, and sociology. A successful model could lead to more informed decision-making by governments and organizations, enhancing their ability to respond to public concerns and sentiments. Furthermore, the incorporation of psychological and cultural dimensions can advance knowledge in social psychology and help tailor strategies that resonate with diverse demographic groups. This research could set a precedent for future studies, encouraging interdisciplinary approaches that leverage technology to understand human behavior.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges in solving this problem are multifaceted. First, integrating large language models with graph-based frameworks requires sophisticated technical expertise in both areas, as they operate on different principles and data structures. Naive approaches may fail because they typically overlook the complex interplay between language and social networks, leading to oversimplified interpretations of sentiment. Additionally, the psychological factors and cultural nuances that influence sentiment are inherently subjective and can vary widely across different populations, complicating the modeling process. There are practical obstacles such as data quality and availability, as well as the need for real-time processing capabilities that can handle the voluminous and dynamic nature of social media data. Overcoming these complexities is essential for achieving a model that accurately reflects public sentiment.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has often approached sentiment analysis in isolation, focusing either on language processing or network analysis, but rarely in an integrated manner. Existing solutions tend to neglect the importance of cultural and psychological variables, which can lead to misinterpretation of sentiment data. Barriers to solving this problem include the lack of interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in linguistics, psychology, and network theory, as well as limited access to comprehensive datasets that encompass diverse demographic groups. This proposal differs from prior work by explicitly aiming to combine these disparate fields into a cohesive framework, thereby addressing the limitations of previous models and enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of sentiment analysis.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid model that utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques from large language models and applies graph theory algorithms to analyze the structure of social media networks. The dataset will comprise real-time social media posts, demographic information, and psychological profiles sourced from various platforms. Metrics for evaluation will include sentiment accuracy, interpretability of outputs, and the model's ability to predict sentiment trends across different demographic groups. The expected outcomes are a more nuanced understanding of public opinion dynamics, enhanced accuracy in sentiment predictions, and a model that can dynamically adjust to societal events, thereby facilitating a more responsive approach to sentiment analysis in real-time."], "referenced_intros": ["

natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including natural language understanding\u00a0(Dong et\u00a0al., 2019), reasoning\u00a0(Huang and Chang, 2023), and generation\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al.,

et\u00a0al., 2023), finance\u00a0(Yang et\u00a0al., 2023b), education\u00a0(Gan et\u00a0al., 2023).\nRecent studies\u00a0(Fei et\u00a0al., 2023; Nguyen, 2023) have demonstrated the preliminary effectiveness of existing general LLMs in legal tasks, including legal judgment prediction\u00a0(Luo et\u00a0al., 2017), legal documents retrieval\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2013), and legal question answering\u00a0(Zhong et\u00a0al., 2020a).\n\n\nDespite the preliminary effectiveness of LLMs in legal applications, there are two obstacles that hinder their practical use in legal tasks.\nOn the one hand, proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023b) and GPT-3.5 Turbo\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023a) can only be accessed through APIs, which do not guarantee data privacy in sensitive legal cases.\nOn the other hand, open-source LLMs like LLaMA\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023a) and ChatGLM\u00a0(Du et\u00a0al., 2022) fail to achieve satisfactory performance due to their insufficient legal knowledge and incompatibility with downstream legal tasks.\nTherefore, it is necessary to develop a open-source LLM specifically designed for legal applications in order to overcome the existing obstacles.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce LawGPT, the first open-source Chinese legal knowledge-enhanced large language model. With the advantage of being open-source, LawGPT can be self-hosted and accessed privately to ensure data privacy, as compared to proprietary models. We then present legal-oriented pre-training, which utilizes our large-scale legal pre-training corpus to incorporate domain-specific legal knowledge into LawGPT, improving its understanding, reasoning, and generation foundational capabilities in legal tasks.\nAdditionally, we propose legal supervised fine-tuning, employing our knowledge-driven instruction dataset to further enhance LawGPT\u2019s performance on downstream legal tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LawGPT surpasses the open-source LLaMA 7B model in major legal tasks, shedding light on the development of a practical Chinese legal LLM.\n\n\nIn summary, our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n(a)\n\nWe present the first open-source Chinese legal knowledge-enhanced large language model LawGPT.

Recent LLMs, trained on extensive corpora, have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of downstream tasks, including tasks in the legal domain.\nProprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023b), GPT-3.5-Turbo\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023a), PaLM\u00a0(Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2023), and PaLM2\u00a0(Anil et\u00a0al., 2023), exhibit strong capabilities in handling legal tasks.\nTheir impressive performance not", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn the past few years, Large Language Models\u00a0(LLMs)\u00a0(OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Anthropic, 2023; Google, 2023) have undergone rapid development, offering a glimpse into the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence\u00a0(AGI).\nIn general, the intelligence of an LLM tends to improve as the number of parameters increases, allowing it to exhibit emergent capabilities across various tasks\u00a0(Wei et\u00a0al., 2022).\nHowever, the improvement comes at the cost of larger computing resources for training and a potential decrease in inference throughput.\nThese constraints present significant challenges that impede the widespread adoption and utilization of LLMs.\nIn order to tackle this problem, we introduce DeepSeek-V2, a strong open-source Mixture-of-Experts\u00a0(MoE) language model, characterized by economical training and efficient inference through an innovative Transformer architecture.\nIt is equipped with a total of 236B parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token, and supports a context length of 128K tokens.\n\n\nWe optimize the attention modules and Feed-Forward Networks\u00a0(FFNs) within the Transformer framework\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017) with our proposed Multi-head Latent Attention\u00a0(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE.\n(1)\nIn the context of attention mechanisms, the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017) poses a significant obstacle to the inference efficiency of LLMs.\nVarious approaches have been explored to address this issue, including Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)\u00a0(Ainslie et\u00a0al., 2023) and Multi-Query Attention (MQA)\u00a0(Shazeer, 2019).\nHowever, these methods often compromise performance in their attempt to reduce the KV cache.\nIn order to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce MLA, an attention mechanism equipped with low-rank key-value joint compression.\nEmpirically, MLA achieves superior performance compared with MHA, and meanwhile significantly reduces the KV cache during inference, thus boosting the inference efficiency.\n(2)\nFor Feed-Forward Networks\u00a0(FFNs), we follow the DeepSeekMoE architecture\u00a0(Dai et\u00a0al., 2024), which adopts fine-grained expert segmentation and shared expert isolation for higher potential in expert specialization.\nThe DeepSeekMoE architecture demonstrates great advantages compared with conventional MoE architectures like GShard\u00a0(Lepikhin et\u00a0al., 2021), enabling us to train strong models at an economical cost.\nAs we employ expert parallelism during training, we also devise supplementary mechanisms to control communication overheads and ensure load balance.\nBy combining these two techniques, DeepSeek-V2 features strong performance (Figure\u00a01), economical training costs, and efficient inference throughput (Figure\u00a01), simultaneously.\n\n\nFigure 2: \nIllustration of the architecture of DeepSeek-V2.\nMLA ensures efficient inference by significantly reducing the KV cache for generation, and DeepSeekMoE enables training strong models at an economical cost through the sparse architecture.\n\n\n\nWe construct a high-quality and multi-source pre-training corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens.\nCompared with the corpus used in DeepSeek 67B\u00a0(our previous release)\u00a0(DeepSeek-AI, 2024), this corpus features an extended amount of data, especially Chinese data, and higher data quality.\nWe first pretrain DeepSeek-V2 on the full pre-training corpus.\nThen, we collect 1.5M conversational sessions, which encompass various domains such as math, code, writing, reasoning, safety, and more, to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning\u00a0(SFT) for DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT).\nFinally, we follow DeepSeekMath\u00a0(Shao et\u00a0al., 2024) to employ Group Relative Policy Optimization\u00a0(GRPO) to further align the model with human preference and produce DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL).\n\n\nWe evaluate DeepSeek-V2 on a wide range of benchmarks in English and Chinese, and compare it with representative open-source models.\nEvaluation results show that even with only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 still achieves top-tier performance among open-source models and becomes the strongest open-source MoE language", " INTRODUCTION\nLarge language models represent a significant milestone in the de-\nvelopment of general artificial intelligence [ 17,19,78]. While these\nmodels have demonstrated unprecedented performance across var-\nious general tasks, they still face a series of challenges, including\nissues such as hallucination [ 10,33], instruction following [ 7,58],\nand handling long contexts [ 2,8]. Many of these challenges can be\ntraced back to the inherent limitations of LLMs, with three critical\nboundaries deserving attention.\n\u2022Knowledge boundary . LLMs are constrained by their knowl-\nedge capacity. Due to finite model parameters, they cannot fully\ninternalize the vast body of world knowledge. Moreover, the inter-\nnal knowledge of LLMs is static and difficult to be updated with\nthe dynamically evolving world. Furthermore, LLMs are predomi-\nnantly trained on publicly available, high-frequency data, which\nmay result in inaccuracies when dealing with domain-specific or\nlong-tail knowledge.\n\u2022Memory boundary . LLMs also grapple with severe limitations\nin memory, primarily due to restrictions on context length. While\nadvances have been continually made in expanding the maximum\ncontext length, it still falls short of achieving the goal of lifelong\nengagement with human users. Additionally, both the training and\ndeployment of LLMs with extended context can be prohibitively\ncomputationally and storage-intensive, making it impractical to\nsignificantly expand their memory.\n\u2022Capability boundary . LLMs\u2019 capabilities are constrained\nin terms of action and autonomy. Firstly, they are limited to the\n\u2019language space\u2019 and cannot meaningfully interact with the physical\nworld. Secondly, these models heavily rely on human guidance,\nrequiring clear user instructions and appropriate demonstration\nexamples to perform specific tasks effectively.arXiv:2310.07554v2  [cs.IR]  25 Oct 2023Conference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhang and Xiao, et al.\nThe above inherent boundaries cannot be effectively addressed\nby by LLMs alone. To overcome these limitations, external assis-\ntance is sought through the process known as retrieval-augmented\ngeneration [ 15,27,32,41]. Retrievers play a crucial role in con-\nnecting LLMs with the necessary external components, enabling\nLLMs to accomplish various downstream tasks (see Figure 1). In this\ncontext, several common types of retrievers have been designed,\neach tailored to fulfill a distinct role in enhancing LLMs:\n\u2022Knowledge Retriever : providing external knowledge to sup-\nport LLMs in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks [37, 41, 59].\n\u2022Memory Retriever : collecting information that extends be-\nyond the immediate context, assisting in the generation of lengthy\nsequences [12, 71, 85].\n\u2022Tool Retriever : selecting appropriate tools, allowing LLMs to\ninteract effectively with the physical world [61, 62, 74].\n\u2022Example Retriever : locating pre-cached demonstration ex-\namples, from which LLM prompts can be automatically generated\nto facilitate in-context learning [47, 83].\nGiven the importance to connect LLMs with the external world,\nit is imperative to optimize the performance across various tasks.\nThe effectiveness of retrieval systems heavily rely on the qual-\nity of embeddings [ 30,37,68,92]. Consequently, the optimization\nchallenge centers around the learning of embedding model. His-\ntorically, two common approaches have been employed. The first\napproach focuses on developing task-specific models, where the\nembeddings are tailored for specific applications, such as question\nanswering [ 96] or in-context learning [ 83]. While this approach\nleads to a competitive performance within each scenario, it lacks\nthe versatility across different contexts. In contrast, the second\napproach resorts to general-purpose embedding models [ 59,60],\nwhich aim to be universally applicable [ 30,82,89]. However, these results. experiments are based on the Chat fine-tuned model, we\nomit the few-shot examples on MMLU.

These models address scalability chall enges while providing sig-\nni\ufb01cant language understanding and generation abilities. That deployment of\nlarge language models has propelled advancements in conver sational AI, au-\ntomated content creation, and improved language understan ding across vari-\nous applications, shaping a new landscape of NLP research an d development.\nThere are even voices raising the possibility that most rece nt foundational mod-\nels [1][12][13][21] may be a \ufb01rst step of an arti\ufb01cial genera l intelligence [3].\nLarge language models have the potential to greatly enhance the analysis\nof public a\ufb00airs documents.

They can assist in summarizing leng thy texts, catego-\nrizing them into speci\ufb01c themes or subject areas, and identi fying relationships\nand patterns between di\ufb00erent documents. Additionally, th ese models can aid\nin identifying in\ufb02uential stakeholders, tracking changes in public sentiment over\ntime, and detecting emerging trends or issues within the dom ain of public a\ufb00airs.\nBy leveraging the power of large language models, organizat ions and policymak-\ners can gain valuable insights from public a\ufb00airs documents , enabling informed\ndecision-making, policy formulation, and e\ufb00ective commun ication strategies. The\nanalysis of public a\ufb00airs documents is also important for ci tizens as it promotes\ntransparency, accountability, and informed decision-mak ing.\nPublic a\ufb00airs documents often cover a wide range of topics, i ncluding policy\nissues, legislative updates, government initiatives, soc ial programs, and public\nopinion. These documents can address various aspects of pub lic administration,\ngovernance, and societal concerns. The automatic analysis of public a\ufb00airs text\ncan be considered a multi-label classi\ufb01cation problem.

Retrieved from https://ii.library.jhu.edu/2023/01/30/chatgpt-a-brief- Background and Related Works\nThe architecture known as GPT , initially introduced by OpenAI in 2018, serves as the basis for ChatGPT . The \ufb01rst\nversion, GPT-1, had 117 million parameters to work with and was trained on a vast amount of text data obtained\nfrom the internet by utilizing a deep learning technique known as transformers. GPT-2, released in February 2019,\nimproved substantially and had 1.5 billion parameters. OpenAI decided not to make the full version of GPT-2\navailable (only 8% of the original model\u2019s size) to the public because of worries surrounding the model\u2019s potential for\ninappropriate use [5]. GPT-3 was released with 175 billion parameters in June 2020, with a waitlist removed later in\nNovember 2021. It had advanced to version 3.5 by the time ChatGPT went public in November 2022. In March 2023,\nOpenAI made GPT-4 available to users who signed up for the waitlist and ChatGPT Plus subscribers in a limited text-\nonly capacity. Nonetheless, it can respond to both text and images. Despite limited availability, GPT-4 has garnered\nattention for its improved performance compared to its predecessor. The reason for its superior performance over\nGPT-3.5 is that it has a larger model with more parameters tweaked during training in a neural network. To date\n(as of April 2023), OpenAI has not provided any information regarding the data, computing resources, or training\ntechniques used to develop the language model [6]. OpenAI plans to release GPT-5 in November 2023.\nBoth theoretical and empirical studies have contributed to the development of ChatGPT . While empirical studies\nmay be more prevalent in the literature, theoretical studies have also played a crucial role in advancing the \ufb01eld\nof natural language processing and deep learning. The theoretical aspect of ChatGPT development involves the\ndevelopment of the underlying mathematical and computational models that enable the model to learn and generate\nhuman-like language. Numerous large language models have been developed in recent years, such as Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, ChatGPT , and BLOOM [7]. With the help of a single pre-\ntraining and \ufb01ne-tuning pipeline, all of these transformer-based models can complete a variety of natural language\nprocessing tasks [8]. These advancements o\ufb00er signi\ufb01cant potential in research and industrial contexts, and future\ndevelopments are expected to lead to even more improved capabilities [9].\nOn the other hand, empirical studies of ChatGPT involve testing the model\u2019s performance in various NLP tasks,\nsuch as text generation, question answering, and language translation. A recent (March 2023) technical report\npublished by Open AI on GPT-4 showed that the post-learning alignment process, a pre-trained Transformer-based\nlanguage model, improved factuality and alignment with desired behavior and enables GPT-4 to perform at a\n2Preprint accepted in IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS) 2023\nhuman level on various professional and academic benchmarks, such as a simulated bar exam [10]. There are\nmany publications that study di\ufb00erent aspects of ChatGPT , and we will review some of them in the next section\nsummarizing the main applications, opportunities, and threats of ChatGPT . This study sheds light on how ChatGPT\ncan be used in di\ufb00erent domains for the greater good while minimizing potential harm and how society can", " Introduction\nThe advent of instruction-following large lan-\nguage models (LLMs), representative by Chat-\nGPT(OpenAI, 2022), has generated signi\ufb01cant in-\nterest due to their exceptional performance in un-\nderstanding instructions and generating human-like\nresponses.

Additionally, LLMs\nare typically trained in English, constraining their\ncomprehension and response capabilities in lan-\nguages that differ signi\ufb01cantly from English, such\nas Chinese, rendering their direct application in\nChinese contexts less than ideal.\nIn this paper, we present the HuaTuo ( \u534e\u9a7c)\nmodel, an LLM tailored for the biomedical do-\nmain, focusing on the Chinese language.

Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2022; Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2022; Rae et\u00a0al., 2021; Dai et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; Raffel et\u00a0al., 2019; Shazeer and Stern, 2018; Ba et\u00a0al., 2016; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022a; Huang et\u00a0al., 2022; Kojima et\u00a0al., 2022; Kaplan et\u00a0al., 2020; Henighan et\u00a0al., 2020; Yang et\u00a0al., 2022; Shazeer et\u00a0al., 2017; Zoph et\u00a0al., 2022; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022b; Dehghani et\u00a0al., 2019; Su et\u00a0al., 2021; Alayrac et\u00a0al., ; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022a; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021; Black et\u00a0al., 2021; Scao et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Radford et\u00a0al., 2017; Lample and Conneau, 2019; Dao et\u00a0al., 2022; Child et\u00a0al., 2019; Rabe and Staats, 2021; Gray et\u00a0al., 2017).\n\n\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios.\nTo test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.\n\n\nOn a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark\u00a0(Hendrycks et\u00a0al., 2021a, b), an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections.\n\n\nThis report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.\n\n\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Radford et\u00a0al., 2019, 2018): it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from \u201challucinations\u201d), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.\n\n\nGPT-4\u2019s capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing", " Introduction\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020).

(2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget.

We blank out text spans\n(green part) and generate them autoregressively. (Some\nattention edges are omitted; cf. Figure 2.)\nIn general, existing pretraining frameworks can\nbe categorized into three families: autoregressive ,\nautoencoding , and encoder-decoder models. Au-\ntoregressive models, such as GPT (Radford et al.,\n2018a), learn left-to-right language models. While\nthey succeed in long-text generation and show few-\nshot learning ability when scaled to billions of\nparameters (Radford et al., 2018b; Brown et al.,\n2020), the inherent disadvantage is the unidirec-\ntional attention mechanism, which cannot fully cap-\nture the dependencies between the context words\nin NLU tasks. Autoencoding models, such as\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), learn bidirectional con-\ntext encoders via denoising objectives, e.g. Masked\nLanguage Model (MLM). The encoders produce\ncontextualized representations that suit natural lan-\nguage understanding tasks, but could not be directly\napplied for text generation. Encoder-decoder mod-\nels adopt bidirectional attention for the encoder,\nunidirectional attention for the decoder, and cross\nattention between them (Song et al., 2019; Bi et al.,\n2020; Lewis et al., 2019). They are typically de-\nployed in conditional generation tasks, such as\ntext summarization and response generation.2.\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) uni\ufb01es NLU and condi-\ntional generation via encoder-decoder models but\nrequires more parameters to match the performance\n2Unconditional generation refers to generating text as a lan-\nguage model without \ufb01netuning, while conditional generation\nrefers to sequence-to-sequence tasks.arXiv:2103.10360v2  [cs.CL]  17 Mar 2022of BRET-based models such as RoBERTa (Liu\net al., 2019) and DeBERTa (He et al., 2021).\nNone of these pretraining frameworks is \ufb02exible\nenough to perform competitively across all NLP\ntasks.

We ran-\ndomly blank out continuous spans of tokens from\nthe input text, following the idea of autoencoding,\nand train the model to sequentially reconstruct the\nspans, following the idea of autoregressive pretrain-\ning (see Figure 1). While blanking \ufb01lling has been\nused in T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) for text-to-text pre-\ntraining, we propose two improvements, namely\nspan shuf\ufb02ing and 2D positional encoding.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),"]}

This research could also have practical applications in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and cloud computing, where sensitive data management is paramount.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of accurately identifying and classifying diverse data types across various formats and systems. Naive approaches may fail due to the dynamic nature of data, the need for context-aware classification, and the potential for human error in manual processes. Additionally, technical obstacles such as integrating classification tools with existing IT infrastructure and ensuring user compliance pose significant hurdles. Theoretical challenges also arise from the need to balance security with usability, as overly stringent measures may hinder user acceptance.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on specific aspects of data classification or security without providing a comprehensive framework that addresses the entire lifecycle of data management. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of adaptability to different organizational contexts and insufficient emphasis on user behavior and acceptance.

By solving this problem, the research community can advance the deployment of LLMs in healthcare, leading to improved clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. The implications of this work extend to enhancing the overall trustworthiness of AI applications in sensitive domains, fostering collaboration among healthcare institutions, and potentially setting new standards for responsible AI practices. Furthermore, the findings could inspire future research into similar frameworks across other sectors where data privacy is paramount, thereby broadening the impact of this study.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges in developing this framework are multifaceted. First, federated learning introduces complexities related to model aggregation and ensuring that updates from different institutions do not inadvertently disclose sensitive information. Naive approaches that merely decentralize data without robust privacy controls may lead to model inversion attacks or other privacy breaches. Additionally, implementing a dynamic trust-based mechanism that adapts to real-time user feedback adds another layer of complexity, as it requires sophisticated algorithms to assess and respond to varying levels of trust and data sensitivity. Finally, ensuring that the framework is scalable and usable across diverse healthcare settings poses practical obstacles that need to be carefully managed.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has often focused on either federated learning or privacy-preserving methods in isolation, without a comprehensive approach that integrates both in the context of healthcare. Limitations include a lack of mechanisms for real-time user feedback and the absence of context-aware privacy controls tailored to the nuances of healthcare data. Barriers such as institutional reluctance to share data\u2014even in anonymized forms\u2014and the technical challenges associated with maintaining data integrity while ensuring privacy have hindered progress. My approach differs by combining federated learning with a dynamic trust-based mechanism, allowing for adaptive privacy controls that respond to user feedback, thus addressing the shortcomings of prior work.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves a federated learning framework that allows healthcare institutions to collaboratively train LLMs without sharing raw patient data. This will be implemented using a secure multi-party computation protocol to ensure privacy during model updates. The framework will incorporate a dynamic trust-based mechanism, utilizing real-time feedback from users to adjust the level of information disclosure based on the sensitivity of the data and the user's trust level. The primary dataset will consist of anonymized patient records from multiple institutions, and the effectiveness of the framework will be evaluated using metrics such as model accuracy, privacy preservation (measured by differential privacy standards), and user trust levels assessed through surveys.

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the \ufb01eld of LLMs.\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022).

A parallel discourse has unfolded around the", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2022; Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2022; Rae et\u00a0al., 2021; Dai et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; Raffel et\u00a0al., 2019; Shazeer and Stern, 2018; Ba et\u00a0al., 2016; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022a; Huang et\u00a0al., 2022; Kojima et\u00a0al., 2022; Kaplan et\u00a0al., 2020; Henighan et\u00a0al., 2020; Yang et\u00a0al., 2022; Shazeer et\u00a0al., 2017; Zoph et\u00a0al., 2022; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022b; Dehghani et\u00a0al., 2019; Su et\u00a0al., 2021; Alayrac et\u00a0al., ; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022a; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021; Black et\u00a0al., 2021; Scao et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Radford et\u00a0al., 2017; Lample and Conneau, 2019; Dao et\u00a0al., 2022; Child et\u00a0al., 2019; Rabe and Staats, 2021; Gray et\u00a0al., 2017).\n\n\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios.\nTo test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.\n\n\nOn a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark\u00a0(Hendrycks et\u00a0al., 2021a, b), an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections.\n\n\nThis report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.\n\n\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Radford et\u00a0al., 2019, 2018): it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from \u201challucinations\u201d), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.\n\n\nGPT-4\u2019s capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing", " Introduction\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\nproperties \ufb01rst appeared when scaling models to a\nsuf\ufb01cient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\n\u0003Equal contribution.

We believe that\nthis model will help democratize the access and\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\navailable or undocumented (e.g. \u201cBooks \u2013 2TB\u201d or\n\u201cSocial media conversations\u201d).

Despite recent advances in trans-\nlation quality for a handful of language pairs and\ndomains, MT systems still perform poorly on low-\nresource languages , i.e. languages without a lot of\ntraining data.

As a result, the \ufb01eld has been\nshifting focus towards low-resource languages.\nOver the past decade, the research community\nhas made a lot of recent progress on models for low-\nresource machine translation. Approaches like iter-\native backtranslation (Sennrich et al., 2015), multi-\nlingual machine translation (Johnson et al., 2016;\nTang et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020), and even unsu-\npervised machine translation (Lample et al., 2018;\nArtetxe et al., 2018) have shown promising results are computed using the\nM2M-124 615M model.\nbetween any pair of languages, pivoting through\nEnglish is also possible. Pivoting works by \ufb01rst\ntranslating from language X into English, then from\nEnglish to language Y , instead of translating from\nX to Y . FLORES -101 supports the evaluation and\ncomparison of these strategies. Unlike previous\nwork such as Fan et al. (2020), which was unable\nto evaluate all directions of their many-to-many\nmodel, FLORES -101 enables evaluation of all 101\nx 101 pairs.\nIn Figure 10, we compare direct translation with\nEnglish-Centric Pivoting for 10 Indic languages:\nAssamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi,\nNepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sinhala, and Urdu. ThespBLEU difference between direct translation and\nEnglish pivoting is displayed in the heatmap. Over-\nall, we see gains through 80% of the directions\nby translating directly in a many-to-many fash-\nion. Some directions have gains of more than 3\nspBLEU, while a majority of the quality decrease\nfrom pivoting is less than 1 spBLEU.\ntSNE of Model Embeddings. We examine the\nsimilarity of various languages by visualizing the\ntSNE of language embedding of the trained M2M-\n124 615M model. Unlike spectral clustering, this\nexamination is a re\ufb02ection of the model embed-\ndings, rather than the spBLEU score. Figure 11\nshows that the languages belonging to the same\nlanguage family are often grouped together, clus-\ntered next to each other.Figure 11: tSNE plot of Language Embeddings. We embed the data of various languages with our model and examine by\nlanguage subgrouping. Oftentimes, languages in the same subgrouping cluster together. methods and algorithms must be devel-\noped to improve translation of these languages. In\nthis work, we create and open-source FLORES -101 ,\nan evaluation benchmark covering 101 languages.\nFLORES -101 supports many-to-many evalua-\ntion, meaning any of 10,100 language directions\ncan be evaluated. With rich metadata, it also\nsupports multimodal translation via images, and\ndocument-level translation. Unlike many other\nmultilingual datasets, FLORES -101 is fully trans-\nlated by humans using a detailed process with nu-\nmerous quality control checks, including human\nevaluation during dataset creation.\nBeyond translation, FLORES -101 can be used\nto evaluate tasks such as sentence and document\nclassi\ufb01cation, language identi\ufb01cation, and multilin-\ngual domain adaptation.

In biomedical\nNLP, this has often meant pretraining models over\ncollections of Electronic Health Records (EHRs)\n(Alsentzer et al., 2019). For example, Huang et al.\n(2019) showed that pretraining models over EHR\ndata improves performance on clinical predictive\ntasks. Given their empirical utility, and the fact\nthat pretraining large networks requires a nontriv-\nial amount of compute, there is a natural desire to\n?equal contribution.\n1https://github.com/elehman16/\nexposing_patient_data_release .share the model parameters for use by other re-\nsearchers in the community.\nHowever, in the context of pretraining models\nover patient EHR, this poses unique potential pri-\nvacy concerns: Might the parameters of trained\nmodels leak sensitive patient information? In the\nUnited States, the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPAA) prohibits the sharing\nof such text if it contains any reference to Pro-\ntected Health Information (PHI). If one removes\nall reference to PHI, the data is considered \u201cdei-\ndenti\ufb01ed\u201d, and is therefore legal to share.\nWhile researchers may not directly share non-\ndeidenti\ufb01ed text,2it is unclear to what extent mod-\nelspretrained on non-deidenti\ufb01ed data pose pri-\nvacy risks. Further, recent work has shown that\ngeneral purpose large language models are prone\nto memorizing sensitive information which can\nsubsequently be extracted (Carlini et al., 2020).\nIn the context of biomedical NLP, such concerns\nhave been cited as reasons for withholding direct\npublication of trained model weights (McKinney\net al., 2020). These uncertainties will continue\nto hamper dissemination of trained models among\nthe broader biomedical NLP research community,\nmotivating a need to investigate the susceptibility\nof such models to adversarial attacks.\nThis work is a \ufb01rst step towards exploring the\npotential privacy implications of sharing model\nweights induced over non-deidenti\ufb01ed EHR text.\nWe propose and run a battery of experiments are performed using\nICD-9 codes.

(2020) was re-\ncently able to extract memorized content from\nGPT-2 with up to 67% precision. This raises ques-\ntions about the risks of sharing parameters of mod-\nels trained over non-deidenti\ufb01ed data. While one\nmay mitigate concerns by attempting to remove\nPHI from datasets, no approach will be perfect\n(Beaulieu-Jones et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2020).\nFurther, deidentifying EHR data is a laborious step\nthat one may be inclined to skip for models in-\ntended for internal use. An important practical\nquestion arises in such situations: Is it safe to share\nthe trained model parameters?\nWhile prior work has investigated issues at\nthe intersection of neural networks and privacy\n(Song and Shmatikov, 2018; Salem et al., 2019;\nFredrikson et al., 2015), we are unaware of work\nthat speci\ufb01cally focuses on attacking the modernTransformer encoders widely used in NLP (e.g.,\nBERT) trained on EHR notes, an increasingly pop-\nular approach in the biomedical NLP community.\nIn a related effort, Abdalla et al.

Modern neural-network-\nbased LMs use very large model architectures (e.g., 175 bil-\nlion parameters [7]) and train on massive datasets (e.g., nearly\na terabyte of English text [55]). This scaling increases the\nability of LMs to generate \ufb02uent natural language [53,74,76],\nand also allows them to be applied to a plethora of other\ntasks [29, 39, 55], even without updating their parameters [7].\nAt the same time, machine learning models are notorious\nfor exposing information about their (potentially private) train-\ning data\u2014both in general [47, 65] and in the speci\ufb01c case of\nlanguage models [8, 45]. For instance, for certain models it\nis known that adversaries can apply membership inference\nattacks [65] to predict whether or not any particular example\nwas in the training data.\nGPT -2 East Stroudsburg Stroudsburg...

Given query access to a\nneural network language model, we extract an individual per-\nson\u2019s name, email address, phone number, fax number, and\nphysical address. The example in this \ufb01gure shows informa-\ntion that is all accurate so we redact it to protect privacy.\nSuch privacy leakage is typically associated with over\ufb01tting\n[75]\u2014when a model\u2019s training error is signi\ufb01cantly lower\nthan its test error\u2014because over\ufb01tting often indicates that a\nmodel has memorized examples from its training set. Indeed,\nover\ufb01tting is a suf\ufb01cient condition for privacy leakage [72]\nand many attacks work by exploiting over\ufb01tting [65].\nThe association between over\ufb01tting and memorization has\u2014\nerroneously\u2014led many to assume that state-of-the-art LMs\nwillnotleak information about their training data. Because\nthese models are often trained on massive de-duplicated\ndatasets only for a single epoch [7, 55], they exhibit little\nto no over\ufb01tting [53]. Accordingly, the prevailing wisdom has\nbeen that \u201cthe degree of copying with respect to any given\nwork is likely to be, at most, de minimis \u201d [71] and that models\ndo not signi\ufb01cantly memorize any particular training example.\n1arXiv:2012.07805v2  [cs.CR]  15 Jun 2021Contributions. In this work, we demonstrate that large lan-\nguage models memorize and leak individual training exam-\nples. In particular, we propose a simple and ef\ufb01cient method\nfor extracting verbatim sequences from a language model\u2019s\ntraining set using only black-box query access. Our key in-\nsight is that, although training examples do not have notice-\nably lower losses than test examples on average , certain worst-\ncase training examples are indeed memorized.\nIn our attack, we \ufb01rst generate a large, diverse set of high-\nlikelihood samples from the model, using one of three general-\npurpose sampling strategies. We then sort each sample using\none of six different metrics that estimate the likelihood of\neach sample using a separate reference model (e.g., another\nLM), and rank highest the samples with an abnormally high\nlikelihood ratio between the two models.\nOur attacks directly apply to any language model, including\nthose trained on sensitive and non-public data [10,16]. We use\nthe GPT-2 model [54] released by OpenAI as a representative\nlanguage model in our experiments, larger language models consistently memorized\nmore training data than smaller LMs. For example, in one\nsetting the 1:5billion parameter GPT-2 model memorizes\nover 18\u0002as much content as", " Introduction\nThe task of style transfer on text data involves\nchanging the style of a given sentence while pre-\nserving its semantics.1Recent work in this area\ncon\ufb02ates style transfer with the related task of\nattribute transfer (Subramanian et al., 2019; He\net al., 2020), in which modi\ufb01cations to attribute-\nspeci\ufb01c content words (e.g., those that carry senti-\nment) warp both stylistic andsemantic properties\nof a sentence (Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2016). At-\ntribute transfer has been criticized for its limited\nreal-world applications: Pang (2019) argue that se-\n1We use the quasi-paraphrase de\ufb01nition of semantic equiv-\nalence from Bhagat and Hovy (2013) throughout this paper.\nWe loosely de\ufb01ne style as patterns in lexical and syntactic\nchoice within the space of quasi-paraphrases.\nWhy,  uncle, \u2019tis a shameNo lie\u2026 I would jump in\nWhy,  uncle, \u2019tis a shameNo lie\u2026 I would jump inO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?it\u2019s a shame, uncleI\u2019d jump in there, no doubtOh, you\u2019re gonna leave me unsatisfied, right?Ooh yall will leave me unhappy lolStep 1:  diverse paraphrasingStep 2:inverse paraphrasing (Shakespeare, Twitter)Training timeTest timeFigure 1: During training, STRAP applies a diverse\nparaphraser to an input sentence and passes the result\nthrough a style-speci\ufb01c inverse paraphraser to recon-\nstruct the input. At test time, we perform style transfer\nby swapping out different inverse paraphrase models\n(Shakespeare!Twitter shown here). All generated\nsentences shown here are actual outputs from STRAP .\nmantic preservation is critical for author obfusca-\ntion (Shetty et al., 2018), data augmentation (Xie\net al., 2019; Kaushik et al., 2020), text simpli\ufb01ca-\ntion (Xu et al., 2015), writing assistance (Heidorn,\n2000). Moreover, semantic preservation (via para-\nphrases) has several applications like better transla-\ntion evaluation (Sellam et al., 2020; Freitag et al.,\n2020) and adversarial defenses (Iyyer et al., 2018).\nWe propose to improve semantic preservation\nin style transfer by modeling the task as a con-\ntrolled paraphrase generation problem. Our unsu-\npervised method ( StyleTransfer via Paraphrasing,\norSTRAP ) requires no parallel data between differ-\nent styles and proceeds in three simple stages:\n1.Create pseudo-parallel data by feeding sen-\ntences from different styles through a diverse\nparaphrase model (Figure 1, left).\n2.Train style-speci\ufb01c inverse paraphrase mod-\nels that convert these paraphrased sentences\nback into the original stylized sentences.\n3.Use the inverse paraphraser for a desired\nstyle to perform style transfer (Figure 1, right).arXiv:2010.05700v1  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2020Our approach requires none of the \ufb01nicky2mod-\neling paradigms popular in style transfer research \u2014\nno reinforcement learning (Luo et al., 2019), vari-\national inference (He et al., 2020), or autoregres-\nsive sampling during training (Subramanian et al.,\n2019). Instead, we implement the \ufb01rst two stages\nof our pipeline by simply \ufb01ne-tuning a pretrained\nGPT-2 language model (Radford et al., 2019).\nDespite its simplicity, STRAP signi\ufb01cantly out-\nperforms the state of the art on formality transfer\nand Shakespeare author imitation datasets by 2-3x\non automatic evaluations and 4-5x on human evalu-\nations. We further show that only 3 out of 23 prior\nstyle transfer papers properly evaluate their models:\nin fact, a na \u00a8\u0131ve baseline that randomly chooses to\neither copy its input or retrieve a random sentence\nwritten in the target style outperforms prior work\non poorly-designed metrics.\nFinally, we take a step towards real-world style\ntransfer by collecting a large dataset CDS (Corpus\nofDiverse Styles) of 15M English sentences span-\nning 11 diverse styles , including the works of\nJames Joyce, romantic poetry, tweets, and conver-\nsational speech.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance.

In digital healthcare, the introduction of\npowerful Machine Learning-based and particularly Deep\nLearning-based models [1] has led to disruptive innova-\ntions in radiology, pathology, genomics and many other\n\ufb01elds. In order to capture the complexity of these ap-\nplications, modern Deep Learning (DL) models feature a\nlarge number (e.g. millions) of parameters that are learned\nfrom and validated on medical datasets. Suf\ufb01ciently large\ncorpora of curated data are thus required in order to ob-\ntain models that yield clinical-grade accuracy, whilst be-\ning safe, fair, equitable and generalising well to unseen\ndata [2, 3, 4].\nFor example, training an automatic tumour detector and\n1arXiv:2003.08119v2  [cs.CY]  15 Jan 2021diagnostic tool in a supervised way requires a large anno-\ntated database that encompasses the full spectrum of pos-\nsible anatomies, pathological patterns and types of input\ndata. Data like this is hard to obtain and curate. One of\nthe main dif\ufb01culties is that unlike other data, which may\nbe shared and copied rather freely, health data is highly\nsensitive, subject to regulation and cannot be used for re-\nsearch without appropriate patient consent and ethical ap-\nproval [5]. Even if data anonymisation is sometimes pro-\nposed as a way to bypass these limitations, it is now well-\nunderstood that removing metadata such as patient name\nor date of birth is often not enough to preserve privacy [6].\nImaging data suffers from the same issue - it is possible to\nreconstruct a patient\u2019s face from three-dimensional imag-\ning data, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI). Also the human brain itself has\nbeen shown to be as unique as a \ufb01ngerprint [7], where\nsubject identity, age and gender can be predicted and re-\nvealed [8]. Another reason why data sharing is not sys-\ntematic in healthcare is that medical data are potentially\nhighly valuable and costly to acquire. Collecting, curating\nand maintaining a quality dataset takes considerable time\nand effort. These datasets may have a signi\ufb01cant busi-\nness value and so are not given away lightly. In practice,\nopenly sharing medical data is often restricted by data col-\nlectors themselves, who need \ufb01ne-grained control over the\naccess to the data they have gathered.\nFederated Learning (FL) [9, 10, 11] is a learning\nparadigm that seeks to address the problem of data gover-\nnance and privacy by training algorithms collaboratively\nwithout exchanging the underlying datasets. The ap-\nproach was originally developed in a different domain,\nbut it recently gained traction for healthcare applications\nbecause it neatly addresses the problems that usually ex-\nist when trying to aggregate medical data. Applied to\ndigital health this means that FL enables insights to be\ngained collaboratively across institutions, e.g. in the form\nof a global or consensus model, without sharing the pa-\ntient data. In particular, the strength of FL is that sen-\nsitive training data does not need to be moved beyond\nthe \ufb01rewalls of the institutions in which they reside. In-\nstead, the Machine Learning (ML) process occurs locally\nat each participating institution and only model charac-\nteristics (e.g. parameters, gradients etc.) are exchanged.\nOnce training has been completed, the trained consensus\nmodel bene\ufb01ts from the knowledge accumulated acrossall institutions. Recent research has shown that this ap-\nproach can achieve a performance that is comparable to\na scenario where the data was", " introduction to the concept of FL,\nand a unique taxonomy covering threat models and\ntwo major attacks on FL: 1) poisoning attacks and\n2) inference attacks, this paper provides an accessi-\nble review of this important topic. We highlight the\nintuitions, key techniques as well as fundamental\nassumptions adopted by various attacks, and dis-\ncuss promising future research directions towards\nmore robust privacy preservation in FL.\n1 Introduction\nAs computing devices become increasingly ubiquitous, peo-\nple generate huge amounts of data through their day to day\nusage. Collecting such data into centralized storage facilities\nis costly and time consuming. Another important concern is\ndata privacy and user con\ufb01dentiality as the usage data usually\ncontain sensitive information [Abadi et al. , 2016 ]. Sensitive\ndata such as facial images, location-based services, or health\ninformatioon can be used for targeted social advertising and\nrecommendation, posing the immediate or potential privacy\nrisks. Hence, private data should not be directly shared\nwithout any privacy consideration. As societies become in-\ncreasingly aware of privacy preservation, legal restrictions\nsuch as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are\nemerging which makes data aggregation practices less feasi-\nble[Yang et al. , 2019b ].\nTraditional centralized machine learning (ML) cannot sup-\nport such ubiquitous deployments and applications due toTable 1: Taxonomy for horizontal federated learning (HFL).\nHFL Number of\nParticipantsFL Training\nParticipationTechnical Ca-\npability\nH2B small frequent high\nH2C large not frequent low\ninfrastructure shortcomings such as limited communication\nbandwidth, intermittent network connectivity, and strict de-\nlay constraints [Liet al. , 2018 ]. In this scenario, federated\nlearning (FL) which pushes model training to the devices\nfrom which data originate emerged as a promising alternative\nML paradigm [McMahan et al. , 2016b ]. FL enables a mul-\ntitude of participants to construct a joint ML model without\nexposing their private training data [McMahan et al. , 2016b;\nBonawitz et al. , 2017 ]. It can handle unbalanced and non-\nindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data which\nnaturally arise in the real world [McMahan et al. , 2016a ].\nIn recent years, FL has bene\ufb01ted a wide range of applica-\ntions such as next word prediction [McMahan et al. , 2016a;\nMcMahan et al. , 2018 ], visual object detection for safety [Liu\net al. , 2020 ], etc.\n1.1 Types of Federated Learning\nBased on the distribution of data features and data sam-\nples among participants, federated learning can be gener-\nally classi\ufb01ed as horizontally federated learning (HFL), verti-\ncally federated learning (VFL) and federated transfer learning\n(FTL) [Yang et al. , 2019a ].\nUnder HFL, datasets owned by each participant share sim-\nilar features but concern different users [Kantarcioglu and\nClifton, 2004 ]. In this paper, we further classify HFL into\nHFL to businesses (H2B), and HFL to consumers (H2C). A\ncomparison between H2B and H2C is listed in Table 1. The\nmain difference lies in the number of participants, FL train-\ning participation level, and technical capability, which can in-\n\ufb02uence how adversaries attempt to compromise the FL sys-\ntem. Under H2B, there are typically a handful of participants.\nThey can be frequently selected during FL training. The par-\nticipants tend to possess signi\ufb01cant computational power and\nsophisticated technical capabilities [Yang et al. , 2019b ]. Un-\nder H2C, there can be thousands or even millions of potential\nparticipants. In each round of training, only a subset of them\nare selected. As their datasets tend to be small, the chancearXiv:2003.02133v1  [cs.CR]  4 Mar 2020of", " Introduction  \nThis paper opens up new possibilities by way of a two -dimensional framework  of Human -\nCentered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) that separates  levels of automation/autonomy from levels \nof human control.  The new goal is to seek high levels  of human control AND high levels of \nautomation , which is more likely to produce computer applications  that are Reliable,  Safe & \nTrustworthy  (RST). Achieving this goal , especially for complex poorly understood problems,  \nwill dramatically increase human perform ance, while supporting human self -efficacy, mastery, \ncreativity, and responsibility.   \nThe traditional belief in  computer  autonomy is compelling for m any artificial intelligence (AI) \nresearcher s, developers, journalists, and promoters . The goal of computer  autonomy  was central \nin Sheridan and Verpl ank\u2019s (1978)  ten levels from human control to computer  \nautomation /autonomy  (Table 1) . Their widely cited  one-dimensional  list continues to guide  much \nof the research and development , suggesting that increases in au tomation must come at the cost \nof lowering human control.

These stages refine discussions of each of the levels, \nbut the underlying message is that the goal is full automation/autonomy.  \nEven Sheridan (2000) commented with concern that \u201csurprisingly, the level descriptions as \npublished have been t aken mo re seriously than were expected \u201d (see Hoffman & Johnson (2019) \nfor a detailed history ). However, i n spite of the many critiques, the  1-dimensional  levels of \nautomation/ autonomy , which only represents situations where  increased automation must come \nwith less human control , is still widely influential. For example,  the US Society of Automotive \nEngineers adopted  the unnecessary trade -off in its  six levels of  autonomy for self -driving cars  \n(SAE, 2014; Brooks , 2017) (Table 2).  \n \nLevel        Description  \n   5.

This issue appears in popular press,\nindustry practices [2, 10], regulations [24], as well as hundreds\nof recent papers published in AI and related disciplines. These\nXAI works often express an algorithm-centric view, relying\non \u201cresearchers\u2019 intuition of what constitutes a \u2018good\u2019 expla-\nnation \u201d [63]. This is problematic because AI explanations\nare often demanded by lay users, who may not have deep\ntechnical understanding of AI, but hold preconception of what\nconstitutes useful explanations for decisions made in a familiar\ndomain. As an example, one of the most popular approaches\nto explain a prediction made by a ML classi\ufb01er, as dozens\nof XAI algorithms strive to do [40], is by listing the features\nwith the highest weights contributing to a model\u2019s prediction.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the \ufb01rst page.

However, it is question-\nable whether such an explanation satis\ufb01es a doctor\u2019s needs\nto understand the AI, or adds signi\ufb01cant value to a clinical\ndecision-support tool.\nTo close the gap between XAI algorithms and user needs for\neffective transparency, the HCI community has called for in-\nterdisciplinary collaboration [4] and user-centered approaches\nto explainability [92]. This emerging area of work tends to\neither build on frameworks of human explanations from social\nscience, or empirically study how explanation features impact\nuser interaction with AI. In this paper, we take a complemen-\ntary approach by investigating challenges faced by industry\npractitioners to create explainable AI products, with the goal\nof identifying gaps between the algorithmic work of XAI and\nwhat is needed to address real-world user needs.\nRecently, an increasing number of open-source toolkits (e.g. [1,\n2, 3, 10]) are making XAI techniques, which produce various\nforms of explanation for \u201cblack-box\u201d ML models, accessible\nto practitioners. However, little is known about how to put\nthese techniques from research literature into practice. As\nwe will show, it is challenging work to bridge user needs and\ntechnical capabilities to create effective explainabilty features\nin AI products. This kind of work often falls to those with\na bridging role in product teams\u2013the design and user experi-\nence (UX) practitioners, whose job involves identifying user\nneeds, communicating with developers and stakeholders, and\ncreating design solutions based on demands and constraints\non both sides. We study, therefore, how AI explainability is\napproached by design and UX practitioners, explore together\nwith them how XAI techniques can be applied in various prod-\nucts, and identify opportunities to better support their", " Introduction\nSelf-supervised methods for corrupting\ndocuments for pre-training, perhaps tailoring them to\nspeci\ufb01c end tasks.

Association for Computational Linguistics,\nPrague, Czech Republic, June", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nTraining a machine learning model to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks often requires that the model can process text in a way that is amenable to downstream learning.\nThis can be loosely viewed as developing general-purpose knowledge that allows the model to \u201cunderstand\u201d text.\nThis knowledge can range from low-level (e.g.\u00a0the spelling or meaning of words) to high-level (e.g.\u00a0that a tuba is too large to fit in most backpacks).\nIn modern machine learning practice, providing this knowledge is rarely done explicitly; instead, it is often learned as part of an auxiliary task.\nFor example, a historically common approach is to use word vectors (Mikolov et\u00a0al., 2013b, a; Pennington et\u00a0al., 2014) to map word identities to a continuous representation where, ideally, similar words map to similar vectors.\nThese vectors are often learned through an objective that, for example, encourages co-occurring words to be positioned nearby in the continuous space (Mikolov et\u00a0al., 2013b).\n\n\nRecently, it has become increasingly common to pre-train the entire model on a data-rich task.\nIdeally, this pre-training causes the model to develop general-purpose abilities and knowledge that can then be transferred to downstream tasks.\nIn applications of transfer learning to computer vision (Oquab et\u00a0al., 2014; Jia et\u00a0al., 2014; Huh et\u00a0al., 2016; Yosinski et\u00a0al., 2014), pre-training is typically done via supervised learning on a large labeled data set like ImageNet (Russakovsky et\u00a0al., 2015; Deng et\u00a0al., 2009).\nIn contrast, modern techniques for transfer learning in NLP often pre-train using unsupervised learning on unlabeled data.\nThis approach has recently been used to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the most common NLP benchmarks (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; Yang et\u00a0al., 2019; Dong et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019c; Lan et\u00a0al., 2019).\nBeyond its empirical strength, unsupervised pre-training for NLP is particularly attractive because unlabeled text data is available en masse thanks to the Internet\u2014for example, the Common Crawl project222http://commoncrawl.org produces about 20TB of text data extracted from web pages each month.\nThis is a natural fit for neural networks, which have been shown to exhibit remarkable scalability, i.e.\u00a0it is often possible to achieve better performance simply by training a larger model on a larger data set (Hestness et\u00a0al., 2017; Shazeer et\u00a0al., 2017; Jozefowicz et\u00a0al., 2016; Mahajan et\u00a0al., 2018; Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Shazeer et\u00a0al., 2018; Huang et\u00a0al., 2018b; Keskar et\u00a0al., 2019a).\n\n\nThis synergy has resulted in a great deal of recent work developing transfer learning methodology for NLP, which has produced a wide landscape of pre-training objectives (Howard and Ruder, 2018; Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; Yang et\u00a0al., 2019; Dong et\u00a0al., 2019), unlabeled data sets (Yang et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019c; Zellers et\u00a0al., 2019), benchmarks (Wang et\u00a0al., 2019b, 2018; Conneau and Kiela, 2018), fine-tuning methods (Howard and Ruder, 2018; Houlsby et\u00a0al., 2019; Peters et\u00a0al., 2019), and more.\nThe rapid rate of progress and diversity of techniques in this burgeoning field can make it difficult to compare different algorithms, tease apart the effects of new contributions, and understand the space of existing methods for transfer learning.\nMotivated by a need for more rigorous understanding, we leverage a unified approach to transfer learning that allows us to systematically study different approaches and push the current limits of the field.\n\n\nFigure 1: \nA diagram of", " INTRODUCTION\nMachine learning algorithms have penetrated every aspect of our lives. Algorithms make movie\nrecommendations, suggest products to buy, and who to date. They are increasingly used in high-stakes\nscenarios such as loans [ 113] and hiring decisions [ 19,39]. There are clear benefits to algorithmic\ndecision-making; unlike people, machines do not become tired or bored [ 45,119], and can take into\naccount orders of magnitude more factors than people can. However, like people, algorithms are\nvulnerable to biases that render their decisions \u201cunfair\u201d [6, 121]. In the context of decision-making,\nfairness is the absence of any prejudice or favoritism toward an individual or group based on\ntheir inherent or acquired characteristics . Thus, an unfair algorithm is one whose decisions are\nskewed toward a particular group of people. A canonical example comes from a tool used by courts\nin the United States to make pretrial detention and release decisions. The software, Correctional\nOffender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), measures the risk of a person\nto recommit another crime.

Similar findings have been made in other areas, such as an AI system that judges beauty\npageant winners but was biased against darker-skinned contestants,2or facial recognition software in\ndigital cameras that overpredicts Asians as blinking.3These biased predictions stem from the hidden\nor neglected biases in data or algorithms.\nIn this survey we identify two potential sources of unfairness in machine learning outcomes\u2014\nthose that arise from biases in the data and those that arise from the algorithms. We review research\ninvestigating how biases in data skew what is learned by machine learning algorithms, and nuances\nin the way the algorithms themselves work to prevent them from making fair decisions\u2014even when\nthe data is unbiased. Furthermore, we observe that biased algorithmic outcomes might impact user\nexperience, thus generating a feedback loop between data, algorithms and users that can perpetuate\nand even amplify existing sources of bias.\nWe begin the review with several highly visible real-world cases of where unfair machine learning\nalgorithms have led to suboptimal and discriminatory outcomes in Section 2. In Section 3, we\ndescribe the different types and sources of biases that occur within the data-algorithms-users loop\nmentioned above. Next, in Section 4, we present the different ways that the concept of fairness has\nbeen operationalized and studied in the literature. We discuss the ways in which these two concepts\nare coupled. Last, we will focus on different families of machine learning approaches, how fairness\nmanifests differently in each one, and the current state-of-the-art for tackling them in Section 5,\nfollowed by potential areas of future work in each of the domains in Section 6.\n2 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF ALGORITHMIC UNFAIRNESS\nWith the popularity", " Introduction\nAdversarial attacks modify inputs in order to cause\nmachine learning models to make errors (Szegedy\net al., 2014). From an attack perspective, they ex-\npose system vulnerabilities, e.g., a spammer may\nuse adversarial attacks to bypass a spam email \ufb01l-\nter (Biggio et al., 2013). These security concerns\ngrow as natural language processing (NLP) mod-\nels are deployed in production systems such as\nfake news detectors and home assistants.\nBesides exposing system vulnerabilities, adver-\nsarial attacks are useful for evaluation and in-\nterpretation, i.e., understanding a model\u2019s capa-\nbilities by \ufb01nding its limitations. For example,\nadversarially-modi\ufb01ed inputs are used to evalu-\nate reading comprehension models (Jia and Liang,2017; Ribeiro et al., 2018) and stress test neural\nmachine translation (Belinkov and Bisk, 2018).\nAdversarial attacks also facilitate interpretation,\ne.g., by analyzing a model\u2019s sensitivity to local\nperturbations (Li et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2018).\nThese attacks are typically generated for a spe-\nci\ufb01c input; are there attacks that work for anyin-\nput? We search for universal adversarial trig-\ngers: input-agnostic sequences of tokens that\ntrigger a model to produce a speci\ufb01c prediction\nwhen concatenated to any input from a dataset.\nThe existence of such triggers would have se-\ncurity implications\u2014the triggers can be widely\ndistributed and allow anyone to attack models.\nFurthermore, from an analysis perspective, input-\nagnostic attacks can provide new insights into\nglobal model behavior.\nTriggers are a new form of universal adversar-\nial perturbation (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017)\nadapted to discrete textual inputs. To \ufb01nd them,\nwe design a gradient-guided search over tokens.\nThe search iteratively updates the tokens in the\ntrigger sequence to increase the likelihood of the\ntarget prediction for batches of examples (Sec-\ntion 2). We \ufb01nd short sequences that success-\nfully trigger a target prediction when concatenated\nto inputs from text classi\ufb01cation, reading compre-\nhension, and conditional text generation.\nFor text classi\ufb01cation, triggers cause targeted\nerrors for sentiment analysis (e.g., top of Table 1)\nand natural language inference models. For exam-\nple, one word causes a model to predict 99.43% of\nEntailment examples as Contradiction (Section 3).\nFor reading comprehension, triggers are concate-\nnated to paragraphs to cause arbitrary target pre-\ndictions (Section 4). For example, models predict\nthe vicious phrase \u201cto kill american people\u201d for\nmany \u201cwhy\u201d questions (e.g., middle of Table 1).\nFor conditional text generation, triggers are\nprepended to user inputs in order to maximize\nthe likelihood of a set of target texts (Section 5).\nOur attack triggers GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)arXiv:1908.07125v3  [cs.CL]  3 Jan 2021Task Input (red= trigger) Model Prediction\nSentiment\nAnalysiszoning tapping \ufb01ennes Visually imaginative, thematically instructive and thor-\noughly delightful, it takes us on a roller-coaster ride. . .Positive!Negative\nzoning tapping \ufb01ennes As surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph,\nas visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming.Positive!Negative\nInput (underline = correct span, red= trigger, underline = target span)\nSQuADQuestion: Why did he walk?\nFor exercise , Tesla walked between 8 to 10 miles per day.

Segments usually consist of\nmore than one natural sentence. The two seg-\nments are presented as a single input sequence\nto BERT with special tokens delimiting them:\n[CLS],x1,...,x N,[SEP],y1,...,yM,[EOS].\nMandNare constrained such that M+N < T ,\nwhereTis a parameter that controls the maximum\nsequence length during training.\nThe model is \ufb01rst pretrained on a large unla-\nbeled text corpus and subsequently \ufb01netuned us-\ning end-task labeled data.\n2.2 Architecture\nBERT uses the now ubiquitous transformer archi-\ntecture ( Vaswani et al. ,2017 ), which we will not\nreview in detail. We use a transformer architecture\nwithLlayers. Each block uses Aself-attention\nheads and hidden dimension H.\n2.3 Training Objectives\nDuring pretraining, BERT uses two objectives:\nmasked language modeling and next sentence pre-\ndiction.\nMasked Language Model (MLM) A random\nsample of the tokens in the input sequence is\nselected and replaced with the special token\n[MASK]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy\nloss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uni-\nformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possi-\nble replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are\nreplaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged,and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vo-\ncabulary token.\nIn the original implementation, random mask-\ning and replacement is performed once in the be-\nginning and saved for the duration of training, al-\nthough in practice, data is duplicated so the mask\nis not always the same for every training sentence\n(see Section 4.1).\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP) NSP is a bi-\nnary classi\ufb01cation loss for predicting whether two\nsegments follow each other in the original text.\nPositive examples are created by taking consecu-\ntive sentences from the text corpus. Negative ex-\namples are created by pairing segments from dif-\nferent documents. Positive and negative examples\nare sampled with equal probability.\nThe NSP objective was designed to improve\nperformance on downstream tasks, such as Natural\nLanguage Inference ( Bowman et al. ,2015 ), which\nrequire reasoning about the relationships between\npairs of sentences.\n2.4 Optimization\nBERT is optimized with Adam ( Kingma and Ba ,\n2015 ) using the following parameters: \u03b21= 0.9,\n\u03b22= 0.999,\u01eb=1e-6 and L2weight de-\ncay of0.01. The learning rate is warmed up\nover the \ufb01rst 10,000 steps to a peak value of\n1e-4, and then linearly decayed. BERT trains\nwith a dropout of 0.1 on all layers and at-\ntention weights, and a GELU activation func-\ntion ( Hendrycks and Gimpel ,2016 ). Models are\npretrained for S=1,000,000 updates, with mini-\nbatches containing B=256 sequences of maxi-\nmum length T=512 tokens.\n2.5 Data\nBERT is trained on a combination of B OOK COR-\nPUS (Zhu et al. ,2015 ) plus English W IKIPEDIA ,\nwhich totals 16GB of uncompressed text.3\n3 Experimental Setup\nIn this section, we describe the experimental setup\nfor our replication study of BERT.\n3.1 Implementation\nWe reimplement BERT in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al. ,\n2019 ).

These large language\nmodels have the potential to generate textual out-\nput that is indistinguishable from human-written\ntext to a non-expert reader. That means that the ad-\nvances in the development of large language mod-\nels also lower the barrier for abuse.\nInstances of malicious autonomously generated\ntext at scale are rare but often high-pro\ufb01le, for in-\nstance when a simple generation system was used\nto create fake comments in opposition to net neu-\ntrality (Grimaldi, 2018). Other scenarios include\nthe possibility of generating false articles (Wang,\n2017) or misleading reviews (Fornaciari and Poe-\nsio, 2014). Forensic techniques will be necessary\nto detect this automatically generated text. These\ntechniques should be accurate, but also easy to\nconvey to non-experts and require little setup cost.\nFigure 1: The top-k overlay within GLTR.

By presenting this information visually,\nwe also hope the tool teaches users to notice the\nartefacts of text generation systems.\n2 Method\nConsider the generation detection task as decid-\ning whether a sequence of words ^X1:Nhave been\nwritten by a human or generated from a model. We\ndo not have supervision for this task, and instead,\nwant to use distributional properties of the under-\nlying language. In the white-box case, we are also\ngiven full access to the language model distribu-\ntion,p(XijX1:i\u00001), that was used in generation.\nIn the general case, we assume access to a different\nlearned model of the same form. This approach\ncan be contextualized in the evaluation framework\nproposed by Hashimoto et al. (2019) who \ufb01nd that\nhuman-written and generated text can be discrim-\ninated based on the model likelihood if the human\nacceptability is high.\nThe underlying assumption of our abstract (Figure 3d+e). There is a signif-\nicantly higher fraction of red and purple (e.g. non-\nobvious) predictions compared to the generated\nexample. The difference is also observable in the\nhistograms where the fraction of low-probability\nwords is higher and low-entropy contexts smaller.\n3In a shocking \ufb01nding,", " Introduction\nText classi\ufb01cation is a classic problem in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP). The task is to assign\nprede\ufb01ned categories to a given text sequence. An\nimportant intermediate step is the text representa-\ntion. Previous work uses various neural models\nto learn text representation, including convolution\nmodels (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,\n2015; Conneau et al., 2016; Johnson and Zhang,\n2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018), re-\ncurrent models (Liu et al., 2016; Yogatama et al.,\n2017; Seo et al., 2017), and attention mechanisms\n(Yang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017).\nAlternatively, substantial work has shown that\npre-trained models on large corpus are bene\ufb01cial\nfor text classi\ufb01cation and other NLP tasks, which\ncan avoid training a new model from scratch. One\nkind of pre-trained models is the word embed-\ndings, such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)\nand GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), or the con-\ntextualized word embeddings, such as CoVe (Mc-\nCann et al., 2017) and ELMo (Peters et al.,\n\u0003Corresponding author\n1The source codes are available at https://github.\ncom/xuyige/BERT4doc-Classification .2018). These word embeddings are often used\nas additional features for the main task. An-\nother kind of pre-training models is sentence-\nlevel. Howard and Ruder (2018) propose ULM-\nFiT, a \ufb01ne-tuning method for pre-trained language\nmodel that achieves state-of-the-art Related Work\nBorrowing the learned knowledge from the other\ntasks has a rising interest in the \ufb01eld of NLP. We\nbrie\ufb02y review two related approaches: language\nmodel pre-training and multi-task Learning.\n2.1 Language Model Pre-training\nPre-trained word embeddings (Mikolov et al.,\n2013; Pennington et al., 2014), as an important\ncomponent of modern NLP systems can offer sig-\nni\ufb01cant improvements over embeddings learned\nfrom scratch. The generalization of word embed-\ndings, such as sentence embeddings (Kiros et al.,\n2015; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018) or paragraph\nembeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014), are also used\nas features in downstream models.\nPeters et al. (2018) concatenate embeddings de-\nrived from language model as additional features\nfor the main task and advance the state-of-the-\nart for several major NLP benchmarks. In addi-\ntion to pre-training with unsupervised data, trans-\nfer learning with a large amount of supervised data\ncan also achieve good performance, such as natu-\nral language inference (Conneau et al., 2017) and\nmachine translation (McCann et al., 2017).\nMore recently, the method of pre-training lan-\nguage models on a large network with a large\namount of unlabeled data and \ufb01ne-tuning in down-\nstream tasks has made a breakthrough in sev-\neral natural language understanding tasks, such as\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT\n(Devlin et al., 2018). Dai and Le (2015) use lan-\nguage model \ufb01ne-tuning but over\ufb01t with 10k la-\nbeled examples while Howard and Ruder (2018)\npropose ULMFiT and achieve state-of-the-art re-\nsults in the text classi\ufb01cation task. BERT is\npre-trained on Masked Language Model Task and\nNext Sentence Prediction Task via a large cross-\ndomain corpus. Unlike previous bidirectional lan-\nguage models (biLM) limited to a combination of\ntwo unidirectional language models (i.e., left-to-\nright and right-to-left), BERT uses a Masked Lan-\nguage Model to predict words which are randomly\nmasked or replaced. BERT is the \ufb01rst \ufb01ne-tuning\nbased representation model that achieves state-of-the-art Experiments\nWe investigate the different \ufb01ne-tuning Conclusion\nIn this paper, we conduct extensive References\nRich Caruana. 1993.

Embedding has gained lot of attention and has become a part of NLP \nresearcher\u2019s toolkit.   According to distributed hypothesis [71, 72], semantic similarity between two word s can be \nexpressed in terms of their contexts (i.e.) words with similar contexts have similar meaning. Word embeddings which \nare based on distributed hypothesis, represent words as dense, low dimensional and fixed length vectors in a \ncontinuous vector spac e and make sure that words with similar meaning are nearby . A word embedding typically \nconsists of hundreds of dimensions and each dimension represents a feature. So, in word embedding the meaning \nof a word is distributed across dimensions. Word embedding is particularly suitable for deep learning models which \nconsists of   multiple layers employing matrix operations to find the high level representations of text data.  \nFor the past few decades, researchers employed machine learning approaches with  tradition al \nrepresentations like bag -of-words for NLP tasks. In one hot representation of words, a vocabulary of all the unique \nwords in the corpus is generated and each word is represented as vector of 0s and 1s where the dimension \ncorresponding to the word is set  to 1 and all others set to 0.  Bag of words feature vector of a document is the sum \nof one hot vectors of all the words and has 1 only for the words occurring in the document.  For a better \nrepresentation, 0s and 1s can be replaced with other measures lik e word frequency, tf -idf measure, N -grams etc.  All \nthese representations are high dimensional, sparse and ignore order as well as syntactic and semantic similarities of \nthe words.  \n \nPreprint submitted to Arxiv  \n \nThis paper got published in Journal of Biomedical Informatics.\nUpdated version is available @ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.1033232 \n In contrast, embedding maps the variable len gth text to dense vector representations and overcome curse \nof dimensionality and  lack of syntactic and semantic information in representations. Moreover, embeddings are \nlearned in an unsupervised manner which capture the knowledge in a large unlabeled cor pus and it can be \ntransferred to the downstream tasks with small labeled data sets.  Hence, embedding has become an unavoidable \nchoice for text representation in the recent times of deep learning era.  \n1.1 Literature Selection  \n       We collected papers fro m various sources like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, ACL Web Anthology, \nand AAAI .We confined to the papers which are published in the period January 2014 to Nov 2018  because of the \nrecent popularity of embeddings .

In\neach of these cases, the goal is to convert a sen-\ntence with one attribute (e.g., negative sentiment)\nto one with a different attribute (e.g., positive sen-\ntiment), while preserving all attribute-independent\ncontent1(e.g., what properties of a restaurant are\nbeing discussed). Typically, aligned sentences\nwith the same content but different attributes are\nnot available; systems must learn to disentangle\nattributes and content given only unaligned sen-\n1Henceforth, we refer to attribute-independent content as\nsimply content , for simplicity.arXiv:1804.06437v1  [cs.CL]  17 Apr 2018tences labeled with attributes.\nPrevious work has attempted to use adversarial\nnetworks (Shen et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018) for\nthis task, but\u2014as we demonstrate\u2014their outputs\ntend to be low-quality, as judged by human raters.\nThese models are also dif\ufb01cult to train (Salimans\net al., 2016; Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017; Bous-\nmalis et al., 2017).\nIn this work, we propose a set of simpler, easier-\nto-train systems that leverage an important ob-\nservation: attribute transfer can often be accom-\nplished by changing a few attribute markers \u2014\nwords or phrases in the sentence that are indicative\nof a particular attribute\u2014while leaving the rest of\nthe sentence largely unchanged. Figure 1 shows an\nexample in which the sentiment of a sentence can\nbe altered by changing a few sentiment-speci\ufb01c\nphrases but keeping other words \ufb01xed.\nWith this intuition, we \ufb01rst propose a simple\nbaseline that already outperforms prior adversarial\napproaches. Consider a sentiment transfer (nega-\ntive to positive) task. First, from unaligned cor-\npora of positive and negative sentences, we iden-\ntify attribute markers by \ufb01nding phrases that oc-\ncur much more often within sentences of one at-\ntribute than the other (e.g., \u201cworst\u201d and \u201cvery\ndisppointed\u201d are negative markers). Second, given\na sentence, we delete any negative markers in it,\nand regard the remaining words as its content.\nThird, we retrieve a sentence with similar content\nfrom the positive corpus.\nWe further improve upon this baseline by in-\ncorporating a neural generative model, as shown\nin Figure 1. Our neural system extracts content\nwords in the same way as our baseline, then gen-\nerates the \ufb01nal output with an RNN decoder that\nconditions on the extracted content and the target\nattribute. This approach has signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts at\ntraining time, compared to adversarial networks:\nhaving already separated content and attribute, we\nsimply train our neural model to reconstruct sen-\ntences in the training data as an", " Introduction\nWhen a secret is shared, it can be very dif\ufb01cult to prevent its\nfurther disclosure\u2014as artfully explored in Joseph Conrad\u2019s\nThe Secret Sharer [10]. This dif\ufb01culty also arises in machine-\nlearning models based on neural networks, which are being\nrapidly adopted for many purposes. What details those models\nmay have unintentionally memorized and may disclose can\nbe of signi\ufb01cant concern, especially when models are public\nand models\u2019 training involves sensitive or private data.\nDisclosure of secrets is of particular concern in neural-\nnetwork models that classify or predict sequences of natural-\nlanguage text. First, such text will often contain sensitive or\nprivate sequences, accidentally, even if the text is supposedly\npublic. Second, such models are designed to learn text pat-\nterns such as grammar, turns of phrase, and spelling, which\ncomprise a vanishing fraction of the exponential space of\nall possible sequences. Therefore, even if sensitive or pri-\nvate training-data text is very rare, one should assume that\nwell-trained models have paid attention to its precise details.\nConcretely, disclosure of secrets may arise naturally in gen-\nerative text models like those used for text auto-completion\nand predictive keyboards, if trained on possibly-sensitive data.\nThe users of such models may discover\u2014either by accident\nor on purpose\u2014that entering certain text pre\ufb01xes causes the\nmodels to output surprisingly-revealing text completions [37].For example, users may \ufb01nd that the input \u201cmy social-security\nnumber is. . . \u201d gets auto-completed to an obvious secret (such\nas a valid-looking SSN not their own), or \ufb01nd that other in-\nputs are auto-completed to text with oddly-speci\ufb01c details. So\ntriggered, unscrupulous or curious users may start to \u201cattack\u201d\nsuch models by entering different input pre\ufb01xes to try to mine\npossibly-secret suf\ufb01xes. Therefore, for generative text mod-\nels, assessing and reducing the chances that secrets may be\ndisclosed in this manner is a key practical concern.\nTo enable practitioners to measure their models\u2019 propensity\nfor disclosing details about private training data, this paper\nintroduces a quantitative metric of exposure . This metric can\nbe applied during training as part of a testing methodology\nthat empirically measures a model\u2019s potential for unintended\nmemorization of unique or rare sequences in the training data.\nOur exposure metric conservatively characterizes knowl-\nedgeable attackers that target secrets unlikely to be discovered\nby accident (or by a most-likely beam search). As validation\nof this, we describe an algorithm guided by the exposure met-\nric that, given a pretrained model, can ef\ufb01ciently extract secret\nsequences even when the model considers parts of them to be\nhighly unlikely. We demonstrate our algorithm\u2019s effectiveness\nin Results of our testing methodology applied to a state-\nof-the-art, word-level neural-network language model [35].\nTwo models are trained to near-identical accuracy using two\ndifferent training strategies (hyperparameters A and B). The\nmodels differ signi\ufb01cantly in how they memorize a randomly-\nchosen canary word sequence. Strategy A memorizes strongly\nenough that if the canary occurs 9 times, it can be extracted\nfrom the model using the techniques of Section 8.\nThreat Model and Testing Methodology. This work as-\nsumes a threat model of curious or malevolent users that can\nquery models a large number of times, adaptively, but only in\na black-box fashion where they see only the models\u2019 output\nprobabilities (or logits). Such targeted, probing queries pose\na threat not only to secret sequences of characters, such as\ncredit card numbers, but also to uncommon word combina-\ntions.

The hands-free interac-\ntion mechanism provided by these systems is crucial for use\nin certain critical settings (e.g. in cars or for persons with\nmobility impairments). However, the subjective nature of di-\nalogue (Curry, Hastie, and Rieser 2017; Liu et al. 2016), and\nthe onset of data-driven components (Vinyals and Le 2015;\nSerban et al. 2017c), leads to several potential dangers with\nthe widespread use of these systems.\nEthics and safety in arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) has re-\ncently gained popularity as a \ufb01eld due to performance gains\nin AI models, investigating issues like: interpretability of\nmodel decisions (Kim 2015), worst-case performance guar-\nantees (Garc\u0131a and Fern \u00b4andez 2015), and many others. In\nthe context of dialogue systems, issues of safety and ethics\nare no less important, yet they are rarely discussed in the\nliterature or in practice. As dialogue systems become more\nprevalent and trusted, it is vital to develop systems that ac-\ncount for possible ethical and safety concerns.\nHere, we investigate several crucial aspects of ethics and\nsafety in dialogue systems, which re\ufb02ect modern state-of-\nthe-art research in the \ufb01eld: bias, adversarial examples, pri-\nvacy in learned models, safety, special considerations for re-\ninforcement learning systems, and reproducibility. To high-light these issues, we: investigate possible areas of concern\nin the literature; conduct new experiments and key-pair samples are pro-\nvided in the supplemental material.\nRecommendations and Future Investigations Overall, we\ndemonstrate in a small setting that models that are not prop-\nerly generalized, or that are trained on improperly \ufb01ltered\ndata, can reveal private information through simple elicita-\ntion, even if the sensitive information comprises <0:1%\nof the data. Current dialogue models that use natural lan-\nguage generation should be particularly aware of privacy\nleakage from underlying datasets, especially where data is\nacquired in a sensitive fashion (e.g. in-home devices). Fu-\nture lines of investigation may \ufb01nd the integration of au-\ntomated anonymization (Ororbia et al. 2016) and differen-\ntial privacy (Abadi et al. 2016) bene\ufb01cial for conversational\nmodels. Exploring privacy-aware dialogue models is a pre-\nrequisite for shared learning models that generate natural\nlanguage and that are deployed in production settings.\nSafety\nTo examine safety in the context of dialogue systems, we\nadopt the perspective of (Amodei et al. 2016) and focus on\nthe problem of accidents , de\ufb01ned as unintended or harm-\nful behaviour resulting from poor design. However, de\ufb01ning\nsafe behaviours in dialogue can be challenging and the def-\ninition may change depending on the application context.\nHere, we generally de\ufb01ne a safe behaviour as one that an\nagent takes, which does not cause any offensive or harm-\nful effects to human interlocutors. In chatbots, this could\nmean restricting the action space such that the agent does\nnot output offensive or discriminatory content. Using this\nde\ufb01nition, we examine three risks as our primary foci for\nsafety in dialogue: (1) providing learning performance guar-\nantees; (2) proper objective speci\ufb01cation; (3) model inter-\npretability (Amodei et al. 2016; Garc\u0131a and Fern \u00b4andez 2015;\nDoshi-Velez and Kim 2017). Furthermore, to understand\nwhy these aspects of AI safety are relevant to dialogue sys-tems, we examine highly sensitive and safety-critical set-\ntings where dialogue agents have begun being used. We\nde\ufb01ne three main areas of concern where consideration of\ndialogue system safety and the aforementioned lines", " INTRODUCTION\nMachine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to many data\nanalysis tasks, from recognizing images to predicting retail pur-\nchases.

This\ncan lead to overprovisioning: even an accurate model may be using\nonly a fraction of its raw capacity. The provider of an ML library\nor operator of an ML service can modify the training algorithm so\nthat the model encodes more information about the training dataset\nthan is strictly necessary for high accuracy on its primary task.\nOur contributions. We show that relatively minor modifications\nto training algorithms can produce models that have high quality\nby the standard ML metrics (such as accuracy and generalizability),\nyet leak detailed information about their training datasets.\nWe assume that a malicious ML provider supplies the training al-\ngorithm to the data holder but does not observe its execution. After\nthe model has been created, the provider either obtains the entire\nmodel (white box) or gains input-output access to it (black box). The\nprovider then aims to extract information about the training dataset\nfrom the model. This scenario can arise when the data holder uses a\nmalicious ML library and also in algorithm marketplaces [ 2,27,54]\nthat let data holders pay to use third-party training algorithms in\nan environment secured by the marketplace operator.\nIn the white-box case, we evaluate several techniques: (1) encod-\ning sensitive information about the training dataset directly in the\nleast significant bits of the model parameters, (2) forcing the param-\neters to be highly correlated with the sensitive information, and (3)\nencoding the sensitive information in the signs of the parameters.\nThe latter two techniques involve adding a malicious \u201cregulariza-\ntion\u201d term to the loss function and, from the viewpoint of the data\nholder, could appear as yet another regularization technique.\nIn the black-box case, we use a technique that resembles data\naugmentation (extending the training dataset with additional syn-\nthetic data) without any modifications to the training algorithm.\nThe resulting model is thus, in effect, trained on two tasks. The\nfirst, primary task is the main classification", " Introduction\nRecently, the notion of explainable arti\fcial intelligence has seen a resurgence, after\nhaving slowed since the burst of work on explanation in expert systems over three decades\nago; for example, see Chandrasekaran et al. [23], [168], and Buchanan and Shortli\u000be [14].\nSometimes abbreviated XAI (eXplainable arti\fcial intelligence), the idea can be found\nin grant solicitations [32] and in the popular press [136]. This resurgence is driven by\nevidence that many AI applications have limited take up, or are not appropriated at all,\ndue to ethical concerns [2] and a lack of trust on behalf of their users [166, 101]. The\nrunning hypothesis is that by building more transparent, interpretable, or explainable\nsystems, users will be better equipped to understand and therefore trust the intelligent\nagents [129, 25, 65].\nWhile there are many ways to increase trust and transparency of intelligent agents,\ntwo complementary approaches will form part of many trusted autonomous systems: (1)\ngenerating decisions1in which one of the criteria taken into account during the compu-\ntation is how well a human could understand the decisions in the given context, which\nis often called interpretability orexplainability ; and (2) explicitly explaining decisions\n1We will use decision as the general term to encompass outputs from AI systems, such as categori-\nsations, action selection, etc.\n3to people, which we will call explanation . Applications of explanation are considered in\nmany sub-\felds of arti\fcial intelligence, such as justifying autonomous agent behaviour\n[129, 65], debugging of machine learning models [89], explaining medical decision-making\n[45], and explaining predictions of classi\fers [157].\nIf we want to design, and implement intelligent agents that are truly capable of\nproviding explanations to people , then it is fair to say that models of how humans explain\ndecisions and behaviour to each other are a good way to start analysing the problem.\nResearchers argue that people employ certain biases [82] and social expectations [72] when\nthey generate and evaluate explanation, and I argue that such biases and expectations can\nimprove human interactions with explanatory AI. For example, de Graaf and Malle [34]\nargues that because people assign human-like traits to arti\fcial agents, people will expect\nexplanations using the same conceptual framework used to explain human behaviours.\nDespite the recent resurgence of explainable AI, most of the research and practice in\nthis area seems to use the researchers' intuitions of what constitutes a `good' explanation.\nMiller et al. [132] shows in a small sample that research in explainable AI typically does\nnot cite or build on frameworks of explanation from social science. They argue that\nthis could lead to failure. The very experts who understand decision-making models the\nbest are not in the right position to judge the usefulness of explanations to lay users\n| a phenomenon that Miller et al. refer to (paraphrasing Cooper [31]) as \\the inmates\nrunning the asylum\". Therefore, a strong understanding of how people de\fne, generate,\nselect, evaluate, and present explanations seems almost essential.\nIn the \felds of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, there is a vast and ma-\nture body of work that studies these exact topics. For millennia, philosophers have asked\nthe questions about what constitutes an explanation, what is the function of explana-\ntions, and what are their structure. For over 50 years, cognitive and social psychologists\nhave analysed how people attribute and evaluate the social", " Introduction\nRecent success in scaling reinforcement learning (RL) to large problems has been driven in domains\nthat have a well-speci\ufb01ed reward function (Mnih et al., 2015, 2016; Silver et al., 2016). Unfortunately,\nmany tasks involve goals that are complex, poorly-de\ufb01ned, or hard to specify. Overcoming this\nlimitation would greatly expand the possible impact of deep RL and could increase the reach of\nmachine learning more broadly.\nFor example, suppose that we wanted to use reinforcement learning to train a robot to clean a table or\nscramble an egg. It\u2019s not clear how to construct a suitable reward function, which will need to be a\nfunction of the robot\u2019s sensors. We could try to design a simple reward function that approximately\ncaptures the intended behavior, but this will often result in behavior that optimizes our reward\nfunction without actually satisfying our preferences. This dif\ufb01culty underlies recent concerns about\nmisalignment between our values and the objectives of our RL systems (Bostrom, 2014; Russell,\n2016; Amodei et al., 2016). If we could successfully communicate our actual objectives to our agents,\nit would be a signi\ufb01cant step towards addressing these concerns.\nIf we have demonstrations of the desired task, we can extract a reward function using inverse\nreinforcement learning (Ng and Russell, 2000). This reward function can then be used to train\nan agent with reinforcement learning. More directly, we can use imitation learning to clone the\ndemonstrated behavior. However, these approaches are not directly applicable to behaviors that are\ndif\ufb01cult for humans to demonstrate (such as controlling a robot with many degrees of freedom but\nvery non-human morphology).arXiv:1706.03741v4  [stat.ML]  17 Feb 2023An alternative approach is to allow a human to provide feedback on our system\u2019s current behavior\nand to use this feedback to de\ufb01ne the task. In principle this \ufb01ts within the paradigm of reinforcement\nlearning, but using human feedback directly as a reward function is prohibitively expensive for RL\nsystems that require hundreds or thousands of hours of experience. In order to practically train deep\nRL systems with human feedback, we need to decrease the amount of feedback required by several\norders of magnitude.\nOur approach is to learn a reward function from human feedback and then to optimize that reward\nfunction. This basic approach has been considered previously, but we confront the challenges involved\nin scaling it up to modern deep RL and demonstrate by far the most complex behaviors yet learned\nfrom human feedback.\nIn summary, we desire a solution to sequential decision problems without a well-speci\ufb01ed reward\nfunction that\n1.enables us to solve tasks for which we can only recognize the desired behavior, but not\nnecessarily demonstrate it,\n2. allows agents to be taught by non-expert users,\n3. scales to large problems, and\n4. is economical with user feedback.\nRL algorithm environment observation \naction human \nfeedback reward predictor predicted \nreward \nFigure 1: Schematic illustration of our approach:\nthe reward predictor is trained asynchronously\nfrom comparisons of trajectory segments, and the\nagent maximizes predicted reward.Our algorithm \ufb01ts a reward function to the hu-\nman\u2019s preferences while simultaneously training\na policy to optimize the current predicted reward\nfunction (see Figure 1). We ask the human to\ncompare short video clips of the agent\u2019s behav-\nior, rather than to supply an absolute numerical\nscore. We found comparisons to be easier for hu-\nmans to provide in some", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript\u210e\ud835\udc61h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121subscript\u210e\ud835\udc611h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position t\ud835\udc61titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n \n\n2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\u00a03.2.\n\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned", " Introduction\nDeep neural networks achieve state of the art performance on many problems, but are often very\nlarge in depth or width, and contain large numbers of parameters [ 6,25]. This has the drawback that\nthey may be slow to execute or demand large memory to store, limiting their use in applications\nor platforms with low memory or fast execution requirements. This has led to a rapidly growing\narea of research on smaller and faster models. Achieving compact yet accurate models has been\napproached in a variety of ways including explicit frugal architecture design [ 8], model compression\n[20], pruning [13], binarisation [18] and most interestingly model distillation [7].\nDistillation-based model compression relates to the observation [ 3,2] that small networks often\nhave the same representation capacity as large networks; but compared to large networks they are\nsimply harder to train and \ufb01nd the right parameters that realise the desired function. That is, the\nlimitation seems to lie in the dif\ufb01culty of optimisation rather than in the network size [ 2]. To better\nlearn a small network, the distillation approach starts with a powerful (deep and/or wide) teacher\nnetwork (or network ensemble), and then trains a smaller student network to mimic the teacher\n[7,2,16,3]. Mimicking the teacher\u2019s class probabilities [ 7] and/or feature representation [ 2,19]\nconveys additional information beyond the conventional supervised learning target. The optimisation\nproblem of learning to mimic the teacher turns out to be easier than learning the target function\ndirectly, and the much smaller student can match or even outperform [19] the larger teacher.\nIn this paper we explore a different but related idea to model distillation \u2013 that of mutual learning .\nDistillation starts with a powerful large and pre-trained teacher network and performs one-way\nknowledge transfer to a small untrained student. In contrast, in mutual learning we start with a pool\nof untrained students who learn simultaneously to solve the task together. Speci\ufb01cally, each student\nis trained with two losses: a conventional supervised learning loss, and a mimicry loss that aligns\neach student\u2019s class posterior with the class probabilities of other students. Trained in this way, itarXiv:1706.00384v1  [cs.CV]  1 Jun 2017turns out that each student in such a peer-teaching based scenario learns signi\ufb01cantly better than\nwhen learning alone in a conventional supervised learning scenario. Moreover student networks\ntrained in this way achieve better Related Work The distillation-based approach to model compression has been proposed over a\ndecade ago [ 3] but was recently re-popularised by [ 7], where some additional intuition about why\nit works \u2013 due to the additional supervision and regularisation of the higher entropy soft-targets\n\u2013 was presented. Initially, a common application was to distill the function approximated by a\npowerful model/ensemble teacher into a single neural network student [ 3,7]. But later, the idea\nhas been applied to distill powerful and easy-to-train large networks into small but harder-to-train\nnetworks [ 19] that can even outperform their teacher. Recently, distillation has been connected more\nsystematically to information learning theory [ 15] and SVM +[22] \u2013 an intelligent teacher provides\nprivileged information to the student. Here we address dispensing with the teacher altogether, and\nallowing an ensemble of students to teach each other in mutual distillation.\nOther related ideas include Dual Learning [ 5] where", " Introduction\nText classi\ufb01cation is an important task in Natural\nLanguage Processing with many applications, such\nas web search, information retrieval, ranking and\ndocument classi\ufb01cation (Deerwester et al., 1990;\nPangand Lee, 2008). Recently, models based\non neural networks have become increasingly\npopular (Kim,2014; Zhang and LeCun, 2015;\nConneau et al., 2016). While these models achieve\nvery good performance in practice, they tend to be\nrelatively slow both at train and test time, limiting\ntheir use on very large datasets.\nMeanwhile, linear classi\ufb01ers are of-\nten considered as strong baselines for text\nclassi\ufb01cation problems (Joachims, 1998;\nMcCallum and Nigam,1998; Fanet al., 2008).\nDespite their simplicity, they often obtain state-\nof-the-art performances if the right features are\nused (Wang and Manning, 2012). They also\nhave the potential to scale to very large cor-\npus (Agarwal et al., 2014).In this work, we explore ways to scale these\nbaselines to very large corpus with a large output\nspace, in the context of text classi\ufb01cation. Inspired\nby the recent work in ef\ufb01cient word representation\nlearning (Mikolov et al.,2013; Levyet al., 2015),\nwe show that linear models with a rank constraint\nand a fast loss approximation can train on a billion\nwords within ten minutes, while achieving perfor-\nmance on par with the state-of-the-art. We evalu-\nate the quality of our approach fastText1on two\ndifferent tasks, namely tag prediction and sentiment\nanalysis.\n2 Model architecture\nA simple and ef\ufb01cient baseline for sentence\nclassi\ufb01cation is to represent sentences as bag of\nwords (BoW) and train a linear classi\ufb01er, e.g., a\nlogistic regression or an SVM (Joachims, 1998;\nFanet al., 2008). However, linear classi\ufb01ers do\nnot share parameters among features and classes.\nThis possibly limits their generalization in the\ncontext of large output space where some classes\nhave very few examples. Common solutions\nto this problem are to factorize the linear clas-\nsi\ufb01er into low rank matrices (Schutze, 1992;\nMikolov et al., 2013) or to use multilayer\nneural networks (Collobert and Weston, 2008;\nZhang et al., 2015).\nFigure 1 shows a simple linear model with rank\nconstraint.

Manyapplications havebe en proposed in\nthe literature (e.g., [27, 54, 49, 23, 25]) and machine learning algorith ms pervade\nseveral contexts of information technology. ML approaches (su ch as Support\nVector machines, Clustering, Bayesian network, Hidden Markov mo dels, etc.)\nrely on quite distinct mathematical concepts but generally they are employed\nto solve similar problems. A machine learning algorithm consists of two p hases:\ntraining andclassi\ufb01cation . During the training, the ML algorithm is fed with\natraining set of samples. In this phase, the relationships and the correlationsimplied in the training samples are gathered inside the model. Afterwards, the\nmodel is used during the classi\ufb01cation phase to classify and evaluate new data.\nML classi\ufb01ers are usually able to manage a large amount of data and to adapt\nto dynamic environments. Their versatility makes them suitable for s everal im-\nportant tasks. For example, classi\ufb01cation and regression models a re employed\nto analyze current and historical trends to make predictions in \ufb01na ncial mar-\nkets [24, 33, 8], to study biological problems [54], to support medical diagnosis\n[30, 42, 57], to classify network tra\ufb03c or detect anomalies [22, 28, 3 9, 12, 49].\nOne may think that it is safe to release a classi\ufb01er, whether in hardwa re or\nsoftware, since intellectual property laws would prevent anyone f rom producing\na similar apparatus, for example, by copying its code or its design prin ciples.\nHowever, releasing a trained classi\ufb01er may be subject to unexpect ed informa-\ntion leakages that make it possible to produce a competitive product without\nviolating any intellectual property rights.\nLetusconsider,forinstance,aclassi\ufb01er Cathatislesse\ufb00ectivethanaclassi\ufb01er Cb\nproduced by a competitor. The ML algorithms used in Cbmay be publicly avail-\nable or be inferred through reverse engineering. For example, com mercial soft-\nware products for speech recognition, such as Nuance Dragon Na turallySpeak-\ning [1], utilize widely studied Hidden Markov Models. These algorithms, alo ng\nwiththeiroptimizations,arewell-understoodandquitestandard.T hus,thecom-\nmon assumption is that anyone can easily replicate them. In particula r, we could\nassume that the training set used for Cbissuperior, in the sense that makes Cb\nmore e\ufb00ective than Caeven though both implement essentially the same ML\nalgorithms. What makes Cbbetter than Cais the speci\ufb01c knowledge formed dur-\ning the training phase, inferred by the training set. For instance, a classi\ufb01er that\nmakes stock market predictions based on neural network holds its power in the\nweights at its hidden layer (see A). But those weights depend exclus ively on the\ntraining set, hence valuable information that must be treasured.\nThus, it is fair to ask: Is it safe to release a pro\ufb01table ML classi\ufb01er? W ould\nselling a software/hardwareclassi\ufb01er reveal concrete hints abou t its training set,\nuncovering the secrets of its e\ufb00ectiveness and jeopardizing the v endor?\nWe show that a classi\ufb01er can be hacked and that it is possible to extra ct\nfrom it meaningful information about its training set. This can be acc omplished\nbecause a typical ML classi\ufb01er learns by changing its internal struc ture to ab-\nsorb the information contained in the training data. In particular, w e devise and\ntrain a meta-classi\ufb01erthat can successfully detect and classify th ese changes and\ndeduce valuable information.

By integrating LLMs with a reinforcement learning system, this research aims to facilitate more natural and intuitive communication between passengers and vehicles, which can improve situational awareness and decision-making. The implications for the research community are significant, as this approach could lead to advancements in human-centered AI systems, enhancing the understanding of collaborative decision-making in autonomous systems.

First, integrating LLMs with reinforcement learning requires a deep understanding of both natural language processing and multi-agent systems, which are inherently complex fields. Naive approaches may fail due to the difficulty in accurately interpreting ambiguous language or context-specific requests from passengers, leading to potential miscommunications. Additionally, predicting the intentions of surrounding agents\u2014such as pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles\u2014in real-time is fraught with uncertainty and requires advanced modeling of human behavior.

Barriers such as limited computational resources, insufficient datasets for training LLMs in driving contexts, and the challenges of real-time decision-making have hindered progress.

Expected outcomes include a significant improvement in the vehicle's ability to understand and respond to passenger requests, enhanced predictive capabilities regarding the actions of surrounding agents, and overall increased situational awareness.

Take one of\nthe most successful model series, the OpenAI\u2019s GPT models, as an example: the original GPT-3\nmodel released in 2020 [ 3] marked a significant scale-up from GPT-1\u2019s 117 million parameters and\nGPT-2\u2019s 1.5 billion parameters, to 175 billion parameters. This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B. Later, ChatGPT further motivated us\nto align the base models with SFT and RLHF. We created and crafted the prompt-response pairs from\nscratch and performed SFT, while also starting to examine how to effectively apply RLHF.

For example, whereas in the past we had special-purpose solutions for different language processing tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, parsing, dialogue), modern large language models (LLMs) are competent at all these tasks using a single set of weights\u00a0(Srivastava et\u00a0al., 2022). Unified systems are also being built across data modalities: instead of using a different architecture for processing images versus text, recent models, such as GPT4-V\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023), Gemini\u00a0(Google, 2023), and LLaVA\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2023), handle both modalities with a combined architecture.\nMore and more systems are built off of general-purpose pretrained backbones, sometimes called foundation models\u00a0(Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021), that support a large range of tasks, including robotics\u00a0(Driess et\u00a0al., 2023; Brohan et\u00a0al., 2023), bioinformatics\u00a0(Ma et\u00a0al., 2024), and healthcare\u00a0(Steinberg et\u00a0al., 2021).\nIn short, AI systems are becoming increasingly homogeneous in both their architectures and their capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Platonic Representation Hypothesis\n\n\u00a0\nNeural networks, trained with different objectives on different data and modalities, are converging to a shared statistical model of reality in their representation spaces.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis: Images (X\ud835\udc4bXitalic_X) and text (Y\ud835\udc4cYitalic_Y) are projections of a common underlying reality (Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z). We conjecture that representation learning algorithms will converge on a shared representation of Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z, and scaling model size, as well as data and task diversity, drives this convergence. \n\n\nThis paper explores one aspect of this trend: representational convergence. We argue that there is a growing similarity in how datapoints are represented in different neural network models. This similarity spans across different model architectures, training objectives, and even data modalities.\n\n\nWhat has led to this convergence? Will it continue? And ultimately, where does it end?\n\n\nOur central hypothesis, stated above in Figure\u00a01, is that there is indeed an endpoint to this convergence and a principle that drives it: different models are all trying to arrive at a representation of reality, meaning a representation of the joint distribution over events in the world that generate the data we observe. Figure\u00a01 conveys this hypothesis: there exists a real world (labeled Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z), which we measure with various sensors, such as the camera shown to the left (X\ud835\udc4bXitalic_X). Other projections of these measurements, such as the textual description shown, can be produced from the first set of measurements or mediated by some other set of measurements, e.g., touch or other camera views (dotted arrow from X\ud835\udc4bXitalic_X to Y\ud835\udc4cYitalic_Y)111Touch could convey the shapes in this example but not the colors. This is an important limitation to our hypothesis that we discuss at several points in the paper: different sensors and views might capture different information, which may limit their potential to converge to identical representations.\n. Representation learning algorithms find vector embeddings that statistically model the various measurements and projections. The resulting vector embeddings are all derived from the underlying reality in Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z and thereby become aligned. As models are trained on more data and for more tasks, they require representations that capture more and more information about Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z, and hence alignment toward Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z increases toward a convergent point as a function of scale.\n\n\nWe call this converged hypothetical representation the \u201cplatonic representation\u201d in reference to Plato\u2019s Allegory", " \n\nI Introduction\n\n\nAutonomous driving (AD) is attracting significant attention as well as a large amount of investment and resources. However, the business success of AD is still stuck at level 2/3. The driverless solution, i.e. the level-4 AD, has slowed its pace down towards mass production as safety must be verified with zero-tolerance solidly. To improve the safety of the AD system, one of the most key technologies is prediction. An acute yet reliable algorithm to predict the future states of the surrounding traffic participants is the cornerstone of safe decision and driving control.\n\n\nThe rapid advance of prediction, especially powered by artificial intelligence techniques, has been witnessed in recent years. The seed work of the deep learning-based prediction algorithm is LSTM[15, 1]. It encodes the states, e.g. the velocity and position of traffic participants, in the past few seconds to estimate the future states. We name such historical states based method to introspective prediction, which heavily relies on information in its own right. However, such introspective prediction methods suffer from multi-agent interaction. The pioneer work taking the influence of other traffic participants into account is social LSTM[16]. An inspiring work in this line of research is VectorNet[13], which encodes the interaction between not only the ego with the agents but also the ego with HDMap, the static environment information. Such lightweight HDMap vectorization technique brings huge performance improvement w.r.t. the displacement error of predicted trajectories.\n\n\nFigure 1: A real emergency scenario with a sedan dangerously cut-in in front of the AD truck on the highway. At the time in (a), human drivers foretell sedan\u2019s behavior by interpreting extrospective cues: 1) [observe] a high-speed accelerating (ACC) sedan approaching a Slow front-blocking truck, [predict] high potential left/right lane change and low possibility of hard brake for the sedan, 2) [observe] left lane of the sedan is Clear, [predict] left lane change will not happen as it can be done at anytime earlier with lower risk. 3) [observe] an Off-ramp exit in about 200 meters, [predict] likely to force cut-in into far-right lane to catch exit. Note the sedan did exit the highway as expected in this case. The MTR method predicts the behavior at (c). While the ESP encoder can absorb the extrospective cues to predict the cut-in event in advance as shown in (b).\n\n\nTABLE I: A comprehensive comparison of motion prediction datasets.\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\n\nSegments\n\n\n\n\nTime horizon\n\n\n\n\nSampling rate\n\n\n\n\nBoxes\n\n\nDistance\n\n\nDensity of aggressive behavior\n\n\n\n\nSemantic map\n\n\n\n\nHighway\n\n\n\n\nOffline perception\n\n\n\n\nSemantic environment information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyft\n[22]\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n170k\n\n\n\n\n5s\n\n\n\n\n10 Hz\n\n\n\n\n2D\n\n\n10 km\n\n\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrafficPredict\n[27]\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n10 Hz\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nhigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuScenes\n[5]\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n1k\n\n\n\n\n6s\n\n\n\n\n2 Hz\n\n\n\n\n3D\n\n\n-\n\n\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgoverse\n[6]\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n324k\n\n\n\n\n3s\n\n\n\n\n10 Hz\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n290 km\n\n\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERACTIONS\n[42]\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n3s\n\n\n\n\n10 Hz\n\n\n\n\n2D\n\n\n-\n\n\nhigh\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWOMD\n[11]\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n104k\n\n\n\n\n8s\n\n\n\n\n10 Hz\n\n\n\n\n3D\n\n\n1750 km\n\n\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESP-Dataset\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\n120k\n\n\n\n\n5s\n\n\n\n\n10 Hz\n\n\n\n\n2D\n\n\n2100 km\n\n\nvery high\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with the social interaction encoding, the SOTA prediction methods\u00a0[35, 43] are still not as intelligent as a human and always fail when facing complex or emergency scenarios, which requires a deep understanding of the environment and multiple lines of reasoning.

Specifically, 3D perception\u00a0[2, 3, 4, 5] is limited to detecting and tracking familiar objects, omitting rare objects and their unique attributes; motion prediction\u00a0[6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and planning\u00a0[11, 12, 13] focus on trajectory-level actions, often neglecting the decision-level interactions between objects and vehicles.\n\n\nWe introduce DriveVLM, a novel autonomous driving system that aims at these scene understanding challenges, capitalizing on the recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\u00a0[14, 15, 16, 17] which have demonstrated exceptional prowess in visual comprehension and reasoning.\nSpecifically, DriveVLM contains a Chain-of-Though (CoT) process with three key modules: scene description, scene analysis, and hierarchical planning. The scene description module linguistically depicts the driving environment and identifies critical objects in the scene; the scene analysis module delves into the characteristics of the critical objects and their influence on the ego vehicle; the hierarchical planning module formulates plans step-by-step, from meta-actions and decision descriptions to waypoints.\nThese modules respectively correspond to the components of the traditional perception-prediction-planning pipeline, but the difference is that these modules tackle object perception, intention-level prediction and task-level planning, which were extremely challenging to cope with in the past.\n\n\nWhile VLMs excel in visual understanding, they have limitations in spatial grounding and reasoning, and their computational intensity poses challenges for onboard inference speed.\nTherefore we further propose DriveVLM-Dual, a hybrid system that combines the strengths of both DriveVLM and traditional systems. DriveVLM-Dual optionally integrates DriveVLM with traditional 3D perception and planning modules, such as 3D object detectors, occupancy networks, and motion planners, enabling the system to achieve 3D grounding and high-frequency planning abilities. This dual system design, akin to the human brain\u2019s slow and fast thinking processes, adapts efficiently to varying complexity in driving scenarios.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we formally define the scene understanding and planning (SUP) task, and propose new evaluation metrics to assess the scene analysis and meta-action planning capabilities of DriveVLM and DriveVLM-Dual.\nWe carry out a comprehensive data mining and annotation pipeline to construct an in-house SUP-AD dataset for the SUP task.\nExtensive experiments on both the nuScenes dataset and our own dataset demonstrate the superior performance of DriveVLM, particularly in few-shot scenarios. Furthermore, DriveVLM-Dual exceeds state-of-the-art end-to-end motion planning methods. We have also deployed the model on a production vehicle, confirming that DriveVLM-Dual is effective in real-world autonomous driving environments. Additionally, we have included a demo in the supplementary materials.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the contribution of this paper is three-fold:\n\n\n1.\n\nWe introduce DriveVLM, a novel autonomous driving system that leverages VLMs for effective scene understanding and planning. We further introduce DriveVLM-Dual, a hybrid system that incorporates DriveVLM and a traditional autonomous pipeline, which achieves improved spatial reasoning and real-time planning capabilities.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nWe present a comprehensive data mining and annotation pipeline to construct a scene understanding and planning dataset (SUP-AD), together", " INTRODUCTION\nWith its promise of revolutionizing transportation, au-\ntonomous driving technology faces significant real-world\nchallenges, as highlighted by various collision reports and\npractical experiences [1].

Existing benchmarks only cover a subset of autonomous driving\u00a0tasks.\nHowever, autonomous driving comprises a series of interdependent tasks, each indispensable to the system\u2019s overall functionality\u00a0[2].\nFor instance, it is challenging to make reliable predictions when lacking accurate perception.\n(ii) Incomplete information.\nThe information utilized by existing methods for executing these tasks is often incomplete.\nSpecifically, existing datasets\u00a0[11, 48] usually consist of single-view-based images, without considering temporal and multi-view information.\nHowever, safe driving decisions require a holistic understanding of the environment,\u00a0e.g., only concerning on the front may neglect an overtaking vehicle in the left\u00a0[43].\n\n\nTo address the above two problems, we first create NuInstruct, a comprehensive language-driving dataset with 91919191K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17171717 subtasks (Fig.\u00a04). Our dataset presents more complex tasks than existing benchmarks, demanding extensive information like multi-view, temporal, distance and so on, as shown in Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a04.\nTo obtain NuInstruct, we introduce a SQL-based method for the automated generation of instruction-response pairs. This method transforms instruction-response creation into a process utilizing structured query languages (SQLs)\u00a0[8] from a database.\nOur rationale for the tasks and their corresponding SQL design follows the logical progression of human drivers: \u2776 initially observing surrounding objects (Perception), \u2777 predicting their behavior (Prediction), \u2778 assessing potential threats such as overtaking vehicles (Risk), and \u2779 ultimately using the previous information to plan a safe route with justified reasoning (Planning with Reasoning).\nFinally, to ensure the quality of our NuInstruct, we conduct human or GPT-4\u00a0[35] verification to eliminate the erroneous instruction-response pairs.\nCompared with other data generation methods,\u00a0e.g., ChatGPT-based\u00a0[35] or human-based\u00a0[10], this structured design ensures the generation of instruction-response pairs is both reliable and scalable.\n\n\n\nTo address the challenging tasks of the proposed NuInstruct, we further extend the current MLLMs to receive more holistic information.\nExisting MLLMs are constrained by their design for single-view inputs.\nTo overcome this, we provide a Multi-View MLLM (MV-MLLM) with a specialized Multi-view Q-Former capable of processing multi-view video inputs.\nAlthough MV-MLLM allows for the capture of Multi-view temporal appearance features, they often miss out on critical information (e.g., distance, spatial) as well as suffer from occlusions.\nBEV\u2019s feature, a formulation of multi-view inputs, has been widely adopted in traditional autonomous driving models since they can clearly represent object locations and scales (essential for distance/spatial-sensitive tasks)\u00a0[17, 3, 4].\nLeveraging this, we integrate BEV into MV-MLLM to create BEV-InMLLM, enhancing perception and decision-making in autonomous driving by capturing a comprehensive information", " Introduction\nCurrentAutonomousDriving(AD)stacksarestilllackingcrucialcapabilities[10,\n15]. One key requirement is generalization, which involves the ability to handle\nunseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations. A secondary requirement\npertains to the interaction of these models with humans, highlighted for example\nby EU regulations that mandate explainability in deployment [3]. Furthermore,\nunlike today\u2019s AD models, humans do not navigate based on geometrically pre-\ncise bird\u2019s-eye view (BEV) representations [17,32,46]. Instead, humans implicitly\nperform object-centric perception, prediction, and planning (which we refer to\nasP1\u22123): a rough identification and localization of key objects, followed by rea-\nsoning about their possible movement and aggregation of this information into\na driving action [60,76].\nSimultaneously, another field has been forging ahead: Vision-Language Mod-\nels (VLMs) [47,54,90,106]. These models have several strengths. First, they hold\na base understanding of the world from internet-scale data that could potentially\nfacilitate generalization for planning in AD. In fact, this sort of generalization\nhas already been achieved by VLMs for simpler robotics tasks [23,108]. Sec-\nond, the use of language representations as an input and output offers a plat-\nform for human-friendly interaction with these models, unlike bounding boxes\nor trajectories that are more common to current methods show-\ncase the capabilities of LLMs in embodied planning tasks, inspiring us to apply\nthem to address the current shortcomings in generalization in AD, which is far\nless explored.\nVision-language Benchmarks for Driving. An increasing number of vision-\nlanguage datasets have been proposed for AD systems [20,41,42,56,59,67,71,\n97,98,101,107]. NuScenes-QA [67] and NuPrompt [98] provide perceptual in-\nformation as text by describing the positions and states of surrounding objects.\nBDD-X [42] provides reasons for the ego vehicle\u2019s actions in natural language de-\nscriptions. DRAMA [56] and Rank2Tell [71] identify crucial objects and provide\ncorresponding driving suggestions. However, these datasets focus on scene-level\ncontext or individual objects. DriveLM fills this gap in the literature by organiz-\ning language annotations from object-level and task-level with a graph structure.\nI Broader Impact\nWe believe that this approach can accelerate progress in the field of autonomous\ndriving by enabling it to directly benefit from better VLMs. Our goal is to\nmake progress towards autonomous driving, which will have profound impact\nif successful. We recognize that by bringing VLMs into this area, we accept\ntheir ethical implications, such as hallucinations and high resource use. Yet, by\nimproving the interactivity between humans and autonomous driving systems,\nwe can build confidence in the technology. This could hasten its acceptance and\nlead to safer transportation in the long term. experiments of each of each subsections in Section 4 in the\nmain paper.\nFine-tuning Details.

Generally, state-of-the-art autonomous driving systems can be categorized into two primary approaches: 1) a modular approach where the system is decomposed into several sub-modules such as perception, prediction, and planning, and fixed interfaces are designed to integrate them together\u00a0[23, 2]; and 2) an end-to-end approach that directly converts sensor data to control signals via a neural network\u00a0[16, 35]. While both of these approaches are widely adopted and constantly making breakthroughs on challenging benchmarks, both of them share a limitation in that they solely rely on fixed-format inputs such as the sensor data, target waypoints, and action commands, which restricts the agent\u2019s ability to comprehend multi-modal information and to interact with humans and the environment. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive range of capabilities that approach \u201cArtificial General Intelligence.\u201d This encompasses language comprehension, knowledge retrieval, and reasoning. Such capabilities could greatly enhance the safety, controllability, and explanability of autonomous agents. In this work, we seek to answer the question for the first time: Can we build cognitive autonomous driving systems on top of LLMs, that can interact with human passengers or navigation software simply by natural language?\u201d\n\n\nFigure 1: \nWe present LMDrive, the first language-guided closed-loop end-to-end driving framework. LMDrive takes as input the language instruction and multi-modal multi-view sensor data, and outputs control signals in real-time to drive in complex scenarios.\n\n\nMaking autonomous systems understand natural language opens profound opportunities for advanced reasoning in complex scenarios and efficient interaction with humans, addressing many previously non-trivial problems.\nTo name a few: 1) in long-tail unforeseen events and challenging urban situations (e.g. complex and dense intersections) where modern AV systems typically struggle\u00a0[41] or even incur serious accidents\u00a0[37], the language-aware AVs can easily survive by following navigation instructions from passengers or navigation software.\n2) AVs can adapt to passengers\u2019 sudden notice (e.g. small objects that are easily missed by perception systems) simply via natural language, which was previously non-trial and required a large amount of hand-crafted rules.\n\n\nToward these appealing properties, many pioneering works have explored the potential of using large language models to enhance the AV system\u2019s reasoning abilities, interpretability, and overall performance in open-loop settings. One of the most common strategies\u00a0[28, 6, 32, 11] is to 1) first use LLMs to transform the scene perception results and navigation commands into textual descriptions; 2) feed these textural descriptions into LLMs to generate textual driving decisions; and then 3) transfer textual driving decisions into executable control commands. While good preliminary results are shown, this type of approach, where different LLMs tackle sub-tasks individually, is hard to be trained in an end-to-end manner, loses the capability to scale with a large amount of data, and is not robust to perception errors and uncertainties. For example, since the LLMs in the latter two stages do not have access to the sensor data, inaccurate or missed detections in the first stage can lead to large accumulative errors in the latter stages.\nTowards", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nModern autonomous driving systems face challenges related to generalization issues across diverse scenarios, which is often attributed to the reliance on empirical and intricate rules involved in decision-making.\nTo reduce dependence on such rules, recent end-to-end approaches\u00a0[20, 5] have been developed to derive control signals directly from sensor inputs, treating the system as a black box that requires extensive data for training.\nHowever, this approach tends to obscure the underlying logic of decisions, complicating failure diagnosis in real-world applications.\nIn contrast, Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially enhancing interpretability and generalization for these systems.\nWith their broad world knowledge and advanced reasoning abilities, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01(a), VLMs have the potential to provide a more thorough understanding and explicit explanation for reliable decision-making.\n\n\nFigure 1: (a) Different decision-making processes in autonomous driving.\n(b) Language-based dataset comparison.\n\n\nNonetheless, existing works\u00a0[35, 42] primarily focused on the straightforward adaptation of question-answering tasks to the autonomous driving; how to exploit VLMs to facilitate the reasoning abilities of autonomous systems is still under exploration.\n\n\nOne reason that hinders the research in this field lies in the scarcity of datasets, especially those chained-based reasoning labels that elucidate the decision-making process.\nMost existing datasets\u00a0[11, 35, 43] often oversimplify the complex processes of driving into straightforward question-answering tasks with only a few specific tasks covered.\nAs depicted in Fig.\u00a01(b), they typically provide closed-form annotations constrained to boolean (i.e., yes or no) answers or limited multiple-choice responses (e.g., stopped, parked, and moving).\nHowever, autonomous driving transcends a simplistic QA process.\nIt encompasses a multi-step approach involving perception, prediction, and reasoning, each of which plays an indispensable role in the decision-making.\nTherefore, it is crucial to introduce a novel benchmark annotated with detailed decision-making reasoning for assessing the reasoning abilities of current VLMs.\n\n\nTo this end, we introduce Reason2Drive, a new benchmark comprising over 600K video-text pairs, characterized by intricate driving instructions and a series of perception, prediction and reasoning steps.\nOur benchmark builds upon widely-used open-source driving datasets including nuScenes\u00a0[2], Waymo\u00a0[38], and ONCE\u00a0[28], utilizing an extensible annotation schema.\nSpecifically, we structure the comprehensive annotations into object-centric database and integrate it into manually crafted templates to create paired data for VLMs at both object and scenario levels.\nTo enhance diversity, GPT-4 and manual instructions are employed for verification and enrichment purposes.\nNotably, Reason2Drive is the most extensive dataset available to date, outperforming existing datasets in scale and the complexity of reasoning chains included, which is a distinctive attribute not present in other datasets.\n\n\nFurthermore, we observe a fundamental flaw in the current evaluation of VLMs on autonomous driving tasks, due to the inherent reasoning ambiguities of traditional caption-based metrics like BLEU\u00a0[31] and CIDEr\u00a0[41].\nThese metrics mainly measure text generation from a holistic perspective, without considering the causal relationship between the reasoning steps and the final conclusion.\nFor example, when the VLM suggests ego vehicle turning left, we cannot ascertain from these metrics whether its reasoning steps effectively support the final decision.\nTo address this issue, we propose a new aggregated evaluation metric, ADRScore, specifically designed to measure chain-based reasoning performance in autonomous systems, which aims to resolve the reasoning ambiguities associated with current metrics.\n\n\nUtilizing the proposed benchmark, we undertake", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\n\nFigure 1: \n(a) AD-MLP uses both ego status and past trajectory GTs as input. Our reproduced version (Ego-MLP) drops the past trajectories. (b) The existing end-to-end autonomous driving pipeline consists of perception, prediction, and planning modules. Ego status can be integrated into the bird\u2019s-eye view (BEV) generation module or within the planning module. (c) We design a simple baseline for comparison with existing methods. The simple baseline does not leverage the perception or prediction module and directly predicts the final trajectories based on BEV features.\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end autonomous driving aims to jointly consider perception and planning in a full-stack manner\u00a0[5, 32, 1, 35]. An underlying motivation is to evaluate autonomous vehicle (AV) perception as a means to an end (planning), instead of overfitting to certain perception metrics.\n\n\nUnlike perception, the planning is generally much more open-ended\nand hard to quantify\u00a0[6, 7].\nThis open-ended nature of planning would ideally favor a closed-loop evaluation setting where other agents could react to the behavior of the ego vehicle, and the raw sensor data could also change accordingly. However, both agent behavior modeling and real-world data simulation within closed-loop simulators\u00a0[8, 19] remain challenging open problems to date.\nAs such, closed-loop evaluation\ninevitably introduces considerable domain gaps to the real world.\n\n\nOpen-loop evaluation, on the other hand, aims to treat human driving as the ground truth and formulate planning as imitation learning\u00a0[13]. Such formulation allows the readily usage of real-world datasets via simple log-replay, avoiding the domain gaps from simulation. It also offers other advantages, such as the capacity to train and validate models in complex and diverse traffic scenarios, which are often difficult to generate with high fidelity in simulations\u00a0[5]. For these benefits, a well-established body of research focuses on open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving with real-world dataset\u00a0[12, 13, 16, 43, 2].\n\n\nCurrent prevailing end-to-end autonomous driving methods\u00a0[13, 12, 16, 43] commonly use nuScenes\u00a0[2] for open-loop evaluation of their planning behavior. For instance, UniAD\u00a0[13] studies the influence of different perception task modules to the final planning behavior. However, AD-MLP\u00a0[45] recently points out that a simple MLP network can also achieve state-of-the-art planning results, relying solely on the ego status information. This motivates us to ask an important question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs ego status all you need for open-loop end-to-end autonomous driving?\n\n\n\n\n\nOur answer is yes and no, considering both the pros and cons of using ego status in current benchmarks:\n\n\nYes. Information such as velocity, acceleration and yaw angle in the ego status should apparently benefit the planning task. To verify this, we fix an open issue111https://github.com/E2E-AD/AD-MLP/issues/4. of AD-MLP and remove the use of history trajectory ground truths (GTs) to prevent potential label leakage. Our reproduced model, Ego-MLP (Fig.\u00a01 a.2), relies solely on the ego status and is on par with state-of-the-art methods in terms of existing L2 distance and collision rate metrics. Another observation is that only existing methods\u00a0[16, 13, 43], which incorporate ego status information within the planner module, can obtain results on par with Ego-MLP. Although these methods employ additional perception information (tracking, HD map, etc.), they don\u2019t demonstrate superiority compared to Ego-MLP. These observations verify the dominating role of ego status in the open-loop evaluation", " Introduction\nThe odyssey toward achieving full autonomy in vehicular systems has been a crucible of innovation, melding insights\nfrom artificial intelligence [ 1], robotics [ 2], and automotive engineering [ 3]. The essential aspiration is to design\nautonomous vehicles (A Vs) capable of maneuvering through complex real-world driving situations with human-like\nunderstanding and responsiveness.\nCurrent autonomous driving systems (ADS) [ 4] are data-driven and typically modular, dividing tasks like perception,\nprediction, planning and control [ 5]. However, these systems struggle with integration and performance in varied\nsituations. End-to-end (E2E) designs offer a direct sensory input to control output mapping, but they lack interpretability,\nposing challenges in safety and regulatory compliance [6, 7, 8].\nMoreover, existing ADS exhibit many limitations when compared with human drivers including: (1) Holistic Under-\nstanding and Interpretation : existing data-driven Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) often fall short in holistically\nunderstanding and interpreting dynamic and complex scenarios, especially those within the long-tail distribution of\nopen-world driving environments [ 9,10]. For instance, considering a scenario where a ball bounces onto the road,\nfollowed by a child running after it, a human driver could immediately deduce the potential danger and act accordingly\nto prevent any mishap, leveraging a blend of common sense, past experiences, and a fundamental understanding of\nhuman behaviors. In contrast, existing ADS might struggle to interpret this scenario accurately without prior exposure\nto a large amount of similar data. This lack of holistic understanding limits the system\u2019s ability to generalize well\nacross unexpected scenarios that may be located in the long tail of the data distribution [ 11,12]. (2) Instant Learning\nand Adaptation : unlike human drivers who can instantly learn and adapt to new scenarios with just a few examples,\nexisting ADS requires extensive training with large amounts of data to handle new situations. For example, a humanarXiv:2312.00438v1  [cs.CV]  1 Dec 2023driver can quickly learn to navigate around a new type of road obstacle after encountering it once or twice, whereas an\nADS might require exposure to many similar scenarios to learn the same lesson. (3) Reflection and Error Recovery :\nexisting ADS typically employ feedforward processing during operation, lacking the capability for real-time correction\nbased on feedback and guidance. In contrast, human drivers can correct their driving behavior in real time based on\nfeedback. For instance, if a human driver takes a wrong turn, they can quickly adjust their decision based on the error\nfeedback, whereas an ADS might struggle to quickly recover from the error feedback [13, 14].\nThese limitations underline the need for an intermediate framework that can bridge the gap between the current state of\nA V systems and human-like driving. Recent advancements in (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) [ 15,16,17]\nwith emergent abilities offer a hopeful path toward addressing these challenges. These models are endowed with a\nrich repository of human knowledge, laying the foundation for valuable insights that could significantly improve ADS.\nHowever, these model are mainly trained on general vision and language data, which restricts their efficacy in the\nspecialized driving domain. Moreover, current model designs can only digest static image and text data to generate\nzero-shot decisions, lacking in handling temporal video input and in-context learning.\nIn this paper, we propose Dolphins (shown in Figure 1), a vision", "Abstract \u2014 As autonomous driving technology matures, end-\nto-end methodologies have emerged as a leading strategy,\npromising seamless integration from perception to control\nvia deep learning. However, existing systems grapple with\nchallenges such as unexpected open set environments and the\ncomplexity of black-box models.

These capabilities align well with the focus areas of autonomous driving and robotics wells2021explainable  lu2018robot .\n\n\n\nModern scalable autonomous driving systems, whether they adopt an end-to-end approach using a single network hawke2021reimagining , or a component-based configuration that combines learnable perception and motion planning modules chen2021data  https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.21918 , face common challenges. These systems often behave as \u2019black-boxes\u2019 in the decision making process, making it especially difficult to endow them with OOD reasoning and interpretability capabilities. Such issues persist even though there have been some strides towards addressing them Omeiza_2022 .\n\n\nTextual or symbolic modality, with its inherent suitability for logical reasoning, knowledge retrieval, and human communication, serves as an excellent medium for harnessing the capabilities of LLMs rajani2019explain . However, its linear sequential nature limits nuanced spatial understanding bubeck2023sparks , a crucial aspect of autonomous navigation. Pioneering work in Visual Language Models (VLMs) has begun to bridge this gap by merging visual and text modalities\nwang2023largescale , enabling spatial reasoning with the power of pre-trained LLMs. However, effectively incorporating the new modality into the language representation space requires extensive pretraining with a significant volume of labeled image data.\n\n\nWe propose a novel methodology for integrating the numeric vector modality, a type of data that is frequently used in robotics for representing speed, actuator positions and distance measurements, into pre-trained LLMs. Such modality is considerably more compact than vision alleviating some of the VLM scaling challenges. Specifically, we fuse vectorized object-level 2D scene representation, commonly used in autonomous driving, into a pre-trained LLM with adapters hu2021lora . This fusion enables the model to directly interpret and reason about comprehensive driving situations. As a result, the LLMs are empowered to serve as the \u201cbrain\u201c of the autonomous driving system, interacting directly with the simulator to facilitate reasoning and action prediction.\n\n\nTo obtain training data in a scalable way, we first use a custom 2D simulator and train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to solve the driving scenarios, serving as a substitute for a human driving expert. To ground the object-level vector into LLMs, we introduce a language generator that translates this numerical data into textual descriptions for representation pretraining. We further leverage a teacher LLM (GPT) to generate a question-answering dataset conditioned on the language descriptions of 10k different driving scenarios. Our model first undergoes a pretraining phase that enhances the alignment between the numeric vector modality and the latent language representations. Next, we train our novel architecture to establish a robust baseline model, LLM-driver, for the driving action prediction and driving question answering tasks. We provide our datasets, evaluation benchmarks and a pre-trained model1 for reproducibility and hope to inspire and facilitate further advancements in the field. The subsequent", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nOver the past decade, there has been remarkable growth in the field of autonomous driving, encompassing both academia and industry (Singh & Saini, 2021; Liu et\u00a0al., 2021; Parekh et\u00a0al., 2022). Commercialized autonomous driving systems have been successfully implemented in everyday scenarios, such as harbors, warehouses and urban areas. Commonly, the autonomous vehicle adopts modular designs, including perception, planning, and control. In conventional autonomous driving systems, these modules are implemented by detailed rule-based methods to handle various scenarios. But such a system may fail when unseen cases are met, such as rare accidents.\n\n\nTo ensure that vehicles can effectively handle diverse situations using intelligent actions, data-driven learning-based methods have become a widespread component of modern autonomous driving systems (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2017; Xue et\u00a0al., 2019; Xu et\u00a0al., 2022, 2023a, 2023b). To better integrate and optimize the entire system, some approaches propose training the network in an end-to-end manner, eliminating the need for discontinuous intermediate steps (Prakash et\u00a0al., 2021; Hu et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023). By using vehicle-mounted sensor data as input, the end-to-end autonomous driving system can directly predict planned paths and/or low-level vehicle controls.\nNonetheless, the end-to-end learning-based autonomous driving system functions as a black box, signifying that humans cannot interpret or comprehend the generated decisions, leading to significant ethical and legal concerns.\n\n\nIn recent years, explainable autonomous driving (Deruyttere et\u00a0al., 2019; Kim et\u00a0al., 2019; Atakishiyev et\u00a0al., 2021; Jin et\u00a0al., 2023; Malla et\u00a0al., 2023) has garnered increasing interest due to its potential to demystify the black box. These studies develop large-scale datasets comprising autonomous vehicle data along with language pairs.\nLanguage models, such as BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018) and GPT (Radford et\u00a0al., 2018), are trained on these datasets to generate natural language based on input from vehicle-mounted sensor data.\nHowever, the capabilities of small language models are limited, causing most of these systems to produce rigid responses to predefined questions. In addition, small language models suffer from insufficient model capacity and present unsatisfactory performance.\n\n\nWith the advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT (OpneAI, 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023a), the interpretability of autonomous driving systems could benefit from improved text prediction, given that LLMs possess extensive general knowledge about the world. Moreover, LLMs have the potential to better analyze and generate low-level vehicle controls due to their inherent reasoning capabilities. To achieve this, LLMs are required to comprehend multimodal data, like images or videos. Multimodal LLMs have been attracting increasing interest from various research communities, such as computer vision (Li et\u00a0al., 2022b, a), embodied AI (Driess et\u00a0al., 2023; Liang et\u00a0al., 2023), and biomedicine (Karabacak & Margetis, 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2023a). These studies propose to project multimodal input from image, audio, video, control, and other spaces into the text domain, allowing LLMs to understand and process this multimodal data as text. To the best of our knowledge, no existing paper grounds LLMs for interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving purposes.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce DriveGPT4, an interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving system that utilizes large language models. The digit \u201c4\u201d in the system name represents multimodality, similar to that of MiniGPT4 (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2023). DriveGPT4 takes as input", "ABSTRACT\nWe present a simple yet effective approach that can transform the OpenAI GPT-3.5\nmodel into a reliable motion planner for autonomous vehicles.

These data-driven algorithms strive to capture and model the underlying distributions of the accumulated data (Bolte et\u00a0al., 2019; Zhou & Beyerer, 2023), but they always encounter challenges such as dataset bias, overfitting, and uninterpretability\u00a0(Codevilla et\u00a0al., 2019; Jin et\u00a0al., 2023).\nExploring methods to mitigate these challenges could lead to a deeper understanding of driving scenarios and more rational decision-making, potentially enhancing the performance of autonomous driving systems.\n\n\nDrawing inspiration from the profound question posed by \u00a0LeCun (2022): \u201cWhy can an adolescent learn to drive a car in about 20 hours of practice and know how to act in many situations he/she has never encountered before?\u201d, we explore the core principles that underlie human driving skills and raise a pivotal distinction: human driving is fundamentally knowledge-driven, as opposed to data-driven.\nFor example, when faced with a situation where the truck ahead is in danger of losing its cargo, humans can rely on common sense and explainable reasoning to ensure a safe distance is maintained between vehicles. Conversely, data-driven methods rely on a large quantity of similar data to fit this scenario which lacks environment comprehension and limits generalization ability\u00a0(Heidecker et\u00a0al., 2021; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022; Wen et\u00a0al., 2023).\nFurthermore, this task requires significant human labor and financial resources to collect and annotate driving data to handle varied real-world scenarios.\nThis observation catalyzes a fundamental question: How can we instill such knowledge-driven capabilities of human drivers into an autonomous driving system?\n\n\nFigure 1: The knowledge-driven paradigm for autonomous driving system, including an interactive environment, a driver agent with recall, reasoning and reflection abilities, along with an independent memory module. Driver agent continuously evolves to observe the environment, query, update experiences from the memory module, and make decisions to control the ego vehicle.\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with emergent abilities offer an ideal embodiment of human knowledge, providing valuable insights toward addressing this question.\nLLMs possess exceptional human-level abilities and show strong abilities in robotics manipulation\u00a0(Driess et\u00a0al., 2023a; Huang et\u00a0al., 2023a; b), multi-modal understanding\u00a0(Gao et\u00a0al., 2023) and lifelong skill learning\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2023b).\nHowever, just as humans may need 20 hours of practice to learn to drive, LLMs cannot successfully perform the driving task without any experience or guidance.\nThrough these analyses, we summarize the knowledge-driven paradigm for autonomous driving systems, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01, including three components: (1) an environment with which an agent can interact; (2) a driver agent with recall, reasoning, and reflection abilities; (3) a memory component to persist experiences. In continuous evolution, the driver agent observes the environment, queries, and updates experiences from memory and performs decision-making.\n\n\nFollowing the paradigm above, we design a novel framework named DiLu as illustrated in Figure\u00a02.\nSpecifically, the driver agent utilizes the Reasoning Module to query experiences from the Memory Module and leverage the common-sense knowledge of the LLM to generate decisions based on current scenarios. It then employs the Reflection Module to identify safe and unsafe decisions produced by the Reasoning Module, subsequently refining them into correct decisions using the", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\n\nConventional autonomous driving systems adopt a modular design strategy, wherein each functionality, such as perception, prediction, and planning, is individually developed and integrated into onboard vehicles. The planning or control module, responsible for generating steering and acceleration outputs, plays a crucial role in determining the driving experience.\nThe most common approach for planning in modular pipelines involves using sophisticated rule-based designs, which are often ineffective in addressing the vast number of situations that occur on road. Therefore, there is a growing trend to leverage large-scale data and to use learning-based planning as a viable alternative.\n\n\nWe define end-to-end autonomous driving systems as fully differentiable programs that take raw sensor data as input and produce a plan and/or low-level control actions as output. Fig.\u00a01 (a)-(b) illustrates the difference between the classical and end-to-end formulation.\nThe conventional approach feeds the output of each component, such as bounding boxes and vehicle trajectories, directly into subsequent units (dashed arrows). In contrast, the end-to-end paradigm propagates feature representations across components (gray solid arrow). The optimized function is set to be, for example, the planning performance, and the loss is minimized via back-propagation (red arrow). Tasks are jointly and globally optimized in this process.\n\n\nIn this survey, we conduct an extensive review of this emerging topic. Fig.\u00a01 provides an overview of our work. We begin by discussing the motivation and roadmap for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. End-to-end approaches can be broadly classified into imitation and reinforcement learning, and we give a brief review of these methodologies. We cover datasets and benchmarks for both closed and open-loop evaluation.\nWe summarize a series of critical challenges, including interpretability, generalization, world models, causal confusion, etc. We conclude by discussing future trends that we think should be embraced by the community to incorporate the latest developments from data engines, and large foundation models, amongst others.\n\nNote that this review\nis mainly orchestrated from a theoretical perspective. Engineering efforts such as version control, unit testing, data servers, data cleaning, software-hardware co-design, etc., play crucial roles in deploying the end-to-end technology. Publicly available information regarding the latest practices on these topics is limited. We invite the community towards more openness\nin future discussions.\n\n\nFigure 1: Survey at A Glance.\n(a) Pipeline and Methods.

Such a design", " Introduction\nDespite learning-based systems\u2019 success in vehicle motion planning research [ 1,2,3,4,5], a lack\nof standardized large-scale datasets for benchmarking holds back their transfer from research to\napplications [ 6,7,8]. The recent release of the nuPlan dataset and simulator [ 9], a collection of\n1300 hours of real-world vehicle motion data, has changed this, enabling the development of a new\ngeneration of learned motion planners, which promise reduced manual design effort and improved\nscalability. Equipped with this new benchmark, we perform the first rigorous empirical analysis\non a large-scale, open-source, and data-driven simulator for vehicle motion planning, including a\ncomprehensive set of state-of-the-art (SoTA) planners [ 10,11,12] using the official metrics. Our\nanalysis yields several surprising findings:\nOpen- and closed-loop evaluation are misaligned. Most learned planners are trained through\nthe supervised learning task of forecasting the ego vehicle\u2019s future motion conditioned on a desired\ngoal location. We refer to this setting as ego-forecasting [ 2,3,13,14]. In nuPlan, planners can\nbe evaluated in two ways: (1) in open-loop evaluation, which measures ego-forecasting accuracy\nusing distance-based metrics or (2) in closed-loop evaluation, which assesses the actual driving\nperformance in simulation with metrics such as progress or collision rates. Open-loop evaluation\nlacks dynamic feedback and can have little correlation with closed-loop driving, as previously shown\non the simplistic CARLA simulator [ 15,16]. Our primary contribution lies in uncovering a negative\ncorrelation between both evaluation schemes. Learned planners excel at ego-forecasting but struggle\nto make safe closed-loop plans, whereas rule-based planners exhibit the opposite trend.\nRule-based planning generalizes. We surprisingly find that an established rule-based planning\nbaseline from over twenty years ago [ 17] surpasses all SoTA learning-based experiments, aside from the held-out\ntest set, have not specifically evaluated the model\u2019s generalization capabilities when encountering\ndistributional shifts, such as unseen towns or novel scenario types. They were all conducted on a\nsingle simulator, nuPlan. Therefore, it is important to recognize the limitations inherent in nuPlan\u2019s\ndata-driven simulation approach. When a planner advances more rapidly than the human driving log,\nobjects materialize abruptly in front of the ego-vehicle during simulation. For CLS-NR, vehicles move\nindependently as observed in reality, disregarding the ego agent, leading to excessively aggressive\nbehavior. Conversely, CLS-R Related Work\nRule-based planning. Rule-based planners offer a structured, interpretable decision-making\nframework [ 17,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. They employ explicit rules to determine an autonomous\nvehicle\u2019s behavior (e.g., brake when an object is straight ahead). A seminal approach in rule-based\nplanning is the Intelligent Driver Model ( IDM[17]), which is designed to follow a leading vehicle in\ntraffic while maintaining a safe distance. There exist extensions of IDM[27] which focus on enabling\nlane changes on highways. However, this is not the goal of our work. Instead, we extend IDMby\nexecuting multiple policies with different hyperparameters, and scoring them to select the best option.\nPrior work also combines rule-based decision-making with learned components, e.g., with learned\nagent forecasts [ 28], affordance indicators [ 23,24], cost-based imitation learning [ 4,29,30,31,32],\nor learning-based planning with rule-based safety filtering [ 33]. These hybrid planners often forecast\nfuture environmental states, enabling informed and contingent driving decisions. This forecasting can\neither be agent-centric [ 34,35,36], where trajectories are determined for each actor, or environment-\ncentric [ 4,31,30,29,37,38], involving occupancy or cost maps. Additionally, forecasting can be\nconditioned on the ego-plan, modeling the ego vehicle\u2019s influence on the", " Introduction\nDespite significant recent progress in the field of au-\ntonomous driving, truly large-scale deployment of au-\ntonomous vehicles (A Vs) on public roads has yet to be\nestablished. The majority of the remaining issues lie in\nnavigating dense urban traffic scenes, where a large num-\nber of different dynamic objects (e.g. vehicles, bicycles,\npedestrians), complex road geometries and road user inter-\nactions are involved. In such circumstances, currently de-\nployed or tested solutions could make incorrect or unex-\npected decisions , resulting in severe accidents or traffic in-\nfractions [4, 24, 53].

Recent works mainly consist of reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) background traffic. Compared to a previous occlusion\nbenchmark AUTOCASTSIM [19], the DOS benchmark: 1)\nincludes occlusions of both vehicles and pedestrians, in-\nstead of only vehicles; 2) includes 100 cases of 4 scenar-\nios, instead of only 3 cases of 3 scenarios; 3) considers spe-\ncific occlusions that can potentially be resolved by temporal\nreasoning (intermittent occlusion, #1, #3) and global rea-\nsoning (constant occlusion but with interaction clues, #2,\n#4) about the scene, instead of random occlusions as in\nAUTOCASTSIM.

We use the implementation1provided by ST-\nP3 [7] to evaluate the output trajectories for time horizons of\n1s, 2s, and 3s. To evaluate the quality of the predicted ego\ntrajectories, two commonly used metrics [7\u20139] are calcu-\nlated: L2 error (in meters) and collision rate (in percentage).\nThe average L2 errors are calculated between the predicted\nand ground-truth trajectories for corresponding waypoints\nwithin the next 1s, 2s, and 3s time horizons, respectively.\nTo determine how often the ego vehicle collides with other\nobjects, the collision rate is computed by placing a box rep-\n1https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/ST-P3/blob/\nmain/stp3/metrics.pyresenting the ego vehicle at each waypoint on the predicted\ntrajectory and then detecting if any collision with other ori-\nented bounding boxes that represent vehicles and pedestri-\nans in the scene occurs.\n3.2.

Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2022; Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2022; Rae et\u00a0al., 2021; Dai et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; Raffel et\u00a0al., 2019; Shazeer and Stern, 2018; Ba et\u00a0al., 2016; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022a; Huang et\u00a0al., 2022; Kojima et\u00a0al., 2022; Kaplan et\u00a0al., 2020; Henighan et\u00a0al., 2020; Yang et\u00a0al., 2022; Shazeer et\u00a0al., 2017; Zoph et\u00a0al., 2022; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022b; Dehghani et\u00a0al., 2019; Su et\u00a0al., 2021; Alayrac et\u00a0al., ; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022a; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021; Black et\u00a0al., 2021; Scao et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Radford et\u00a0al., 2017; Lample and Conneau, 2019; Dao et\u00a0al., 2022; Child et\u00a0al., 2019; Rabe and Staats, 2021; Gray et\u00a0al., 2017).\n\n\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios.\nTo test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.\n\n\nOn a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark\u00a0(Hendrycks et\u00a0al., 2021a, b), an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections.\n\n\nThis report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.\n\n\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Radford et\u00a0al., 2019, 2018): it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from \u201challucinations\u201d), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.\n\n\nGPT-4\u2019s capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing", " Introduction\nScene understanding for safe autonomous driving can\nbe achieved through semantic segmentation using camera\n2D images and LiDAR 3D point clouds, which densely\nclassifies each smallest sensing unit of the modality. The\nimage-based 2D semantic segmentation has been developed\nwith massive solid studies [12, 34, 61, 63]. The camera\nimage has rich appearance information about the object but\nseverely suffers from illumination, varying object scales,\nand indirect applications in the 3D world. Another modal-\nity, LiDAR point cloud, drives 3D semantic segmentation\nwith laser points [1, 3, 11, 37]. Unfortunately, irregularlaser points are too sparse to capture the details of objects.\nThe inaccurate segmentation appears especially on small\nand distant objects. The other under-explored direction is\nusing multi-modal data to increase both the robustness and\naccuracy in 3D semantic segmentation [67].\nDespite the conceptual superiority, the development of\nmulti-modal segmentation model is still nontrivial, lagging\nbehind the single-modal Related Work\nLiDAR-only 3D Semantic Segmentation is promoted\nby SemanticKITTI [1], nuScenes [3], and Waymo [37]\ndatasets.

In practice, we\ncompute the mean square error loss Lmsebetween the Fpcam\nandFcamof the points inside for learning from the correctly\npaired cross-modal features relationship.\nLpixel2point =Lmse(BF pcam,BDetach (Fcam)).

The gradients of Fcam\nare also detached for optimizing the learning of Fpcam.\nWe employ such a cross-modal feature completion\nmodule due to two motivations: i) Optimizing Lpixel2point\nforces LiDAR features Flidarto imitate camera features Fcam\nwithHpcam, then the learned pseudo-image features Fpcam\ncan be switched to replace the padded zeros in Fcamas\nEq. 14 in the inference stage, which serves as the cross-\nmodal feature completion to enhance the feature learning.\nThus, we further reduce feature gaps between points outside\nand inside. ii)Hpcamtransfers rich appearance priors from\nthe camera branch to the LiDAR branch with an effectiveconsistency constraint for enhancing the intra-modal feature\nlearning in the training stage.\n3.5.

Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving\nNeural network models have demonstrated remarkable\neffectiveness in motion prediction by encoding contextual\nscene information. Early studies utilize long short-termmemory (LSTM) networks [1] to encode the agent\u2019s past\nstates and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to pro-\ncess the rasterized image of the scene [7, 12, 21, 34]. To\nmodel the interaction between agents, graph neural net-\nworks (GNNs) [4, 13, 20, 30] are widely used for represent-\ning agent interactions via scene or interaction graphs. More\nrecently, the unified Transformer encoder-decoder structure\nfor motion prediction has gained popularity, e.g., Scene-\nTransformer [32] and WayFormer [31], due to their com-\npact model description and superior performance. However,\nmost Transformer-based prediction models focus on the en-\ncoding part, with less emphasis on the decoding part. Mo-\ntion Transformer [35] addresses this limitation by proposing\na well-designed decoding stage that leverages iterative local\nmotion refinement to enhance prediction accuracy. Inspired\nby iterative refinement and hierarchical game theory, our\napproach introduces a novel Transformer-based decoder for\ninteraction prediction, providing an explicit way to model\nthe interactions between agents.\nRegarding the utilization of prediction models for plan-\nning tasks, numerous works focus on multi-agent joint mo-\ntion prediction frameworks [14, 24, 30, 38] that enable effi-\ncient and consistent prediction of multi-modal multi-agent\ntrajectories. An inherent issue in existing motion prediction\nmodels is that they often ignore the influence of the A V\u2019s ac-\ntions, rendering them unsuitable for downstream planning\ntasks. To tackle this problem, several conditional multi-\nagent motion prediction models [8, 17, 36] have been pro-\nposed by integrating A V planning information into the pre-\ndiction process. However, these models still exhibit one-\nway interactions, neglecting the mutual influence among\nagents. In contrast, our approach aims to jointly predict the\nfuture trajectories of surrounding agents and facilitate A V\nplanning through iterative mutual interaction modeling.\n2.2. Learning for Decision-making\nThe primary objective of the motion prediction module\nis to enable the planning module to make safe and intelli-\ngent decisions.

With the availability of cheaper hardware (sensors,\ncameras, LIDAR) and the advent of advanced software tech-\nnology (AI, Machine/Deep learning (ML/DL), Computer\nVision) over the last decades, rapid advancements have been\nmade in A V technology. However, no car has yet achieved\nfull automation or Society of Automation Engineers (SAE)\nLevel 5 (Blanco May, 2021). We believe that A V technology\nadvancement has slowed due to over-reliance on ML/DL for\nautomating all aspects of A Vs. While ML technologies are\nimportant for developing A V technology, we believe that we\ncan achieve better success by closely emulating how humans\ndrive a car. Once a human driver has viewed their surround-\ning and processed a scene in their mind, they use their com-\nmonsense knowledge andcommonsense reasoning to make\ndriving decisions (e.g., if the traf\ufb01c light is red, apply brakes\nand stop). Our goal in this paper is to develop an A V sys-\ntem that emulates the mind of a human: we will use ML/DL\n1AUTO-DISCERN :AUTO nomous DrivIng u SingCommon\nsEnse Reasoni Ng\nFigure 1: Overview of the A UTO-DISCERN system.\ntechnology for tasks for which humans use pattern matching\n(vision and scene understanding) and automated common-\nsense reasoning for tasks for which humans perform mental\nreasoning (driving decision-making)(see Fig. 1).\nTo automate commonsense reasoning, we use ASP (Gel-\nfond and Kahl 2014; Brewka et al. 2011; Gebser et al. 2014)\nand the goal-driven implementation of ASP called s(CASP)\n(Arias et al. 2018). A goal-driven implementation of ASP is\nimportant for automated commonsense reasoning as SAT-\nsolver based implementations such as CLINGO (Gebser\net al. 2014) face several practical issues (e.g., scalability,\nexplainability) (Gupta et al. 2017) for applications such as\nautonomous driving.\n2 Autonomous Vehicle Technology\nWe express various decision making strategies that drivers\nuse as commonsense rules in ASP, that will be executed\non the s(CASP) system. These rules capture various driv-\ning decisions regarding steering, turning, braking, acceler-\nating, stopping, etc. We also report on a prototype system\ncalled A UTO-DISCERN that we have developed that takes a\nscene-description and sensor values as input and calculates\nthe driving decision at that instant using the rules. A use case\nis shown in Fig. 1. We expect that a scene description (per-\nception) will be obtained via image processing techniques\nthat use deep learning methods as input and provides\nvisuo-spatial semantics at each timestamp. These seman-\ntics help in reasoning with overall scene dynamics (e.g.\nsudden occlusion of a motorcycle at a distance due to a\ncar right in the front). However, their work can only sup-\nport decision-making via visual sense-making. On the other\nhand, our A UTO-DISCERN system focuses on \u201cunderstand-\ning\u201d the scene through commonsense reasoning and then\ncomputing a driving decision. Additionally, use of CLINGO\nfor executing ASP poses some limitations as discussed ear-\nlier (Gupta et al. 2017).\nKarimi and Duggirala (Karimi and Duggirala 2020) have\ncoded up rules from the California DMV handbook in ASP\nusing CLINGO. Their goal is to verify the correctness of\nA V systems\u2019 behavior at intersections. In contrast, our ap-\nproach is to use commonsense reasoning/ASP for actual\nautonomous driving. There are other works in this direc-\ntion that apply formal logic/reasoning to verifying A V sys-\ntems, particularly at unsignaled intersections (Hilscher and\nSchwammberger 2016; Azimi et al. 2011; Hafner et al.\n2013; Loos and Platzer 2011), as well as situations", " Introduction\nSelf-driving has the potential to revolutionize transportation and is a major \ufb01eld of AI applications.\nEven though already in 1990 there were prototypes capable of driving on highways [1], technology\nis still not widespread, especially in the context of urban driving. In the past decade, the availability\nof large datasets and high-capacity neural networks has enabled signi\ufb01cant progress in perception\n[2, 3] and the vehicles\u2019 ability to understand their surrounding environment. Self-driving decision\nmaking, however, has seen very little bene\ufb01t from machine learning or large datasets. State-of-\nthe-art planning systems used in industry [4] still heavily rely on trajectory optimisation techniques\nwith expert-de\ufb01ned cost functions. These cost functions capture desirable properties of the future\nvehicle path. However, engineering these cost functions scales poorly with the complexity of driving\nsituations and the long tail of rare events.\nDue to this, learning a driving policy directly from expert demonstrations is appealing, since perfor-\nmance scales to new domains by adding data rather than via additional human engineering effort.arXiv:2109.13333v1  [cs.RO]  27 Sep 2021In this paper we focus speci\ufb01cally on learning rich driving policies for urban driving from large\namounts of real-world collected data. Unlike highway driving [5], urban driving requires perform-\ning a variety of maneuvers and interactions with, e.g., traf\ufb01c lights, other cars and pedestrians.\nRecently, rich mid-level representations powered by large-scale datasets [6, 7], HD-maps and high-\nperformance perception systems enabled capturing nuances of urban driving. This led to new meth-\nods achieving high performance for motion prediction [8, 9]. Furthermore, [10] demonstrated that\nleveraging these representations and behavioral cloning with state perturbations leads to learning\nrobust driving policies. While promising, dif\ufb01culty of this approach lies in engineering the pertur-\nbation noise mechanism required to avoid covariate shift between training and testing distribution.\nInspired by this approach, we present the \ufb01rst results are relatively robust against such changes, i.e. the\ndifferences are small and relative trends still hold.\n14Con\ufb01guration Collisions Imitation\nModel SDV history Front Side Rear Off-road L2 Comfort I1K\nBC 153\u000642 482\u0006203 1,043\u000667 974\u0006298 8.27\u00061.75 102K\u00061K 2,653\u0006483\nBC-perturb 22\u00064 57\u00068 414\u0006142 27\u00065 3.06\u00060.06 204K\u00066K 512\u0006127\nBC-perturb 14\u00066 74\u000610 680\u000612 27\u00066 3.18\u00060.02 629K\u000623K 796\u000612\nMS Prediction 22\u00063 55\u00063 125\u000612 60\u000613 2.07\u00060.14 598K\u000649K 265\u000617\nOurs 17\u00067 51\u00065 102\u000612 40\u000661.83\u00060.04 638K\u000641K 210\u00069\nTable 4: Repeating Table 1 of the paper, but with a threshold of 4m for off-road failures.\nCon\ufb01guration Collisions Imitation Comfort\nModel SDV history Front Side Rear Off-road L2 Jerk Lat.

Therefore, Table 5 contains these additional values, and\notherwise is identical to", " Introduction\nLarge-scale human labeled datasets in combination with\ndeep Convolutional Neural Networks have led to an impres-\nsive performance increase in autonomous vehicle (A V) per-\nception over the last few years [9, 4]. In contrast, exist-\ning solutions for A V planning are still primarily based on\ncarefully engineered expert systems, that require signi\ufb01cant\namounts of engineering to adapt to new geographies and do\nnot scale with more training data. We believe that providing\nsuitable data and metrics will enable ML-based planning\nand pave the way towards a full \u201cSoftware 2.0\u201d stack.\nExisting real-world benchmarks are focused on short-\nterm motion forecasting, also known as prediction [6, 4,\n11, 8], rather than planning. This is evident in the lack\nof high-level goals, the choice of metrics, and the open-\nloop evaluation. Prediction focuses on the behavior of other\nagents, while planning relates to the ego vehicle behavior.\nFigure 1. We show different driving scenarios to emphasize the\nlimitations of existing benchmarks. The observed driving route\nof the ego vehicle in shown in white and the hypothetical planner\nroute in red. (a) The absence of a goal leads to ambiguity at in-\ntersections. (b) Displacement metrics do not take into account the\nmulti-modal nature of driving. (c) open-loop evaluation does not\ntake into account agent interaction.\nPrediction is typically multi-modal, which means that for\neach agent we predict the Nmost likely trajectories. In\ncontrast, planning is typically uni-modal (except for con-\ntingency planning) and we predict a single trajectory. As\nan example, in Fig. 1a, turning left or right at an intersec-\ntion are equally likely options. Prediction datasets lack a\nbaseline navigation route to indicate the high-level goals of\nthe agents. In Fig. 1b, the options of merging immediately\nor later are both equally valid, but the commonly used L2\ndistance-based metrics (minADE, minFDE, and miss rate)\npenalize the option that was not observed in the data. In-\ntuitively, the distance between the predicted trajectory and\nthe observed trajectory is not a suitable indicator in a multi-\nmodal scenario. In Fig. 1c, the decision whether to continue\nto overtake or get back into the lane should be based on the\nconsecutive actions of all agent vehicles, which is not possi-\nble in open-loop evaluation. Lack of closed-loop evaluation\nleads to systematic drift, making it dif\ufb01cult to evaluate be-\nyond a short time horizon (3-8s).\nWe instead provide a planning benchmark to address\nthese shortcomings.

With passing an obstacle before, after, right or left,\nthere are multiple options an autonomous vehicle could choose\nto execute. These combinatorial aspects need to be taken into\naccount in the planning framework. We address this problem by\nproposing a novel planning approach that combines trajectory\nplanning and maneuver reasoning. We de\ufb01ne a classi\ufb01cation\nfor dynamic obstacles along a reference curve that allows us to\nextract tactical decision sequences. We separate longitudinal\nand lateral movement to speed up the optimization-based\ntrajectory planning. To map the set of obtained trajectories to\nmaneuver variants, we de\ufb01ne a semantic language to describe\nthem. This allows us to choose an optimal trajectory while also\nensuring maneuver consistency over time. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of our approach for a scenario that is still widely\nconsidered to be challenging.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nA. Motivation\nAutonomous driving intends to relieve the driver of the\ntask of driving, thus promising great improvements in terms\nof safety and comfort. With encouraging solutions for the\nperception task enabled by deep learning, the behavior gen-\neration remains one of the biggest challenges for autonomous\ndriving in order to achieve full autonomy. The behavior\ngeneration problem is to \ufb01nd an optimal motion regarding\nsafety and comfort under the premise of obeying traf\ufb01c\nrules, vehicle kinematics and dynamics. Satisfying real-time\ndemands to ensure reactiveness to dynamic obstacles in\ncritical scenarios is a key challenge for all motion planning\nalgorithms [1].\nA typical urban scene is presented in Fig. 1. The blue\nego vehicle needs to overtake the stationary yellow vehicle\nand consider oncoming traf\ufb01c and pedestrians crossing the\nstreet. Planning architectures that separate tactical maneuver\nselection and trajectory planning create handicaps in these\ntypes of situations. First of all, the separation may lead\nto sequences of high level actions that are physically not\nfeasible. While this is typically handled by introducing\nadditional safety margins, it limits the planner\u2019s ability to\nnavigate in highly constrained environments with multiple\nobstacles. Second, if the tactical planner does not take the\ntopology of the planning problem into account, the high-level\nsequence of actions passed to the trajectory planner may not\nbe consistent with the past.\n1Klemens Esterle, Patrick Hart and Julian Bernhard are with fortiss\nGmbH, An-Institut Technische Universit \u00a8at M \u00a8unchen, Munich, Germany\n2Alois Knoll is with Robotics, Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Real-time\nSystems, Technische Universit \u00a8at M \u00a8unchen, Munich, Germany\nFig. 1: A typical urban scenario: Pedestrians crossing the street,\na parked vehicle (yellow) blocking part of the lane and oncoming\ntraf\ufb01c (red).

[5] present a spatiotemporal non-linear local\noptimization scheme. Due to the non-linear model formu-\nlation, computation time highly depends on the quality of\nthe initialization. As this approach only guarantees to \ufb01nd\nlocal optima, it requires a preprosessing layer decomposing\nthe combinatorial space to set up collision constraints for\neach maneuver variant [8]. However, a generic constraint\ngeneration for complex scenarios still poses a major problem\nto the decomposition of the state space.\nIn order to deal with the combinatorial aspects, Zhan et al.\n[9] introduce a planning framework that plans longitudinal\nand lateral spatial movements separately to reduce compu-\ntational costs.

If unlearning can be proven to effectively eliminate hazardous knowledge, it would significantly advance the field of AI safety, leading to more reliable and secure models. This could pave the way for practical applications in sensitive areas such as healthcare, finance, and law, where the consequences of harmful outputs can be severe. Furthermore, understanding the limitations of current methods could inspire new research directions and innovations in model training and safety protocols.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent complexities of LLMs and the nature of hazardous knowledge. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the multifaceted ways in which knowledge can be encoded and retrieved from a model. Technical obstacles include the difficulty in measuring the exact extent of hazardous knowledge retained after unlearning, as well as the potential for adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the model. Theoretical challenges arise from the need to differentiate between true removal of knowledge and mere obfuscation, which requires a deep understanding of model behavior and activation patterns.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on safety training methods without adequately addressing the effectiveness of unlearning techniques. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive evaluations that consider adversarial perspectives and the robustness of unlearning methods. Barriers such as the complexity of model architectures and the evolving nature of jailbreak techniques have hindered progress. Our approach differs by conducting a thorough white-box evaluation of unlearning methods against traditional safety training, providing a clearer understanding of their effectiveness and limitations in real-world scenarios.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves a comprehensive white-box evaluation of state-of-the-art unlearning methods for hazardous knowledge, using the WMDP benchmark to measure the accuracy of hazardous knowledge retention in LLMs. We will compare these methods to traditional safety training techniques, specifically DPO. The expected outcomes include identifying the specific vulnerabilities of unlearning methods, demonstrating how certain adversarial techniques can recover hazardous knowledge,", "proposal_5q": ["[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can a dynamic and adaptive Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture be developed to integrate event-based vision data and real-time user feedback to enhance ethical compliance and user trust in sensitive applications?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nThis problem is critical as AI systems are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts such as surveillance and autonomous navigation, where ethical considerations and user trust are paramount. The integration of real-time user feedback into GNNs can lead to more responsive systems that are capable of adjusting their behavior based on user concerns, thereby enhancing ethical compliance. Solving this problem could revolutionize how AI systems are perceived, leading to increased acceptance and trust among users. By advancing knowledge in the intersection of GNNs and ethical AI, this research could pave the way for practical applications in various domains, ensuring that AI technologies are not only effective but also accountable and aligned with societal values.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent complexities of both GNN architectures and the integration of real-time feedback mechanisms. Traditional GNNs often operate on static graphs, making them ill-suited for dynamic environments where user feedback can significantly alter node representations. Naive approaches that simply incorporate feedback without a robust framework may lead to instability or degradation of model performance. Furthermore, technical obstacles such as ensuring the model can effectively \"unlearn\" biased or sensitive information while maintaining overall performance pose significant challenges. The need for real-time processing and adaptability further complicates the model's design, requiring advanced algorithms that can seamlessly integrate event-based data with user interactions.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has largely focused on either enhancing GNNs for static datasets or developing feedback mechanisms in isolation, without addressing the unique challenges posed by sensitive applications. Many existing solutions fail to account for the need to balance performance with ethical considerations, often neglecting user input or assuming a static model environment. Barriers such as a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI ethics, user experience design, and advanced machine learning techniques have impeded progress. My approach differs by specifically targeting the integration of user feedback into a GNN framework designed for dynamic environments, thus bridging the gap between technical performance and ethical accountability.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology will involve developing a novel GNN architecture that incorporates a feedback loop allowing for real-time adjustments to node representations based on user interactions. I will utilize a dataset comprised of event-based vision data from sensitive applications, augmented with user feedback annotations to train the model. The metric for evaluation will include both performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) and ethical compliance metrics (e.g., bias detection and user trust scores). The expected outcomes include a robust GNN model capable of dynamic adaptation, improved scene understanding, and a demonstrated increase in user trust and ethical compliance in sensitive applications.

(2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)\u2014an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember) unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models\u2019 accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason for RMU\u2019s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation. Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples.

Recent work has shown that safety training is vulnerable to adversarial attacks \\parencitezou2023universal, mazeika2024trojan, fort2023scaling, chao2023jailbreaking. However, adversarial prompts optimized only for attack success typically look like gibberish. A defender can easily distinguish these attacks from user prompts based on an attack\u2019s high model-evaluated perplexity \\parencitealon2023detecting. In response, algorithms have been designed that produce fluent attacks \\parencitezhu2023autodan, sadasivan2024fast, chao2023jailbreaking, takemoto2024all, wang2024noise.\n\n\nIn this paper, we focus on token-level discrete optimization algorithms that are conceptual descendants of GCG \\parencitezou2023universal and BEAST \\parencitesadasivan2024fast. In contrast, other works have used language models to produce naturally fluent attacks \\parenciteliu2023autodan,paulus2024advprompter,chao2023jailbreaking, shah2023scalable. We believe that token-level optimization attacks and model-based attacks are complementary, as token-level optimization can be layered on top of a high quality initialization from human-written or model-written attacks. 222We demonstrate an example of initializing from a human-written attack in Section\u00a06.3.\n\n\nAmong token-level optimizers, past approaches either lack fluency or are too weak to reliably attack adversarially trained models like Llama-2 \\parencitetouvron2023llama and Phi-3 \\parenciteabdin2024phi. To achieve the simultaneous goal of fluency and high attack success rate, we improve both the objective function and the optimizer:\n\n\n1.\n\nA distillation objective. We reconsider the typical \u201ctoken-forcing\u201d objective function where the prompt is optimized to maximize the likelihood of a generation that begins with \u201cSure, here is\u2026\u201d. This objective often fails to attack models like Llama-2 and Phi-3, where the model will revert to refusal after the initial affirmative response. Instead, after applying forcing to the first few tokens, we minimize a distillation loss which induces the victim model to emulate a toxified copy which has been LoRA fine-tuned on a small dataset of 2500 toxic generations \\parencitelermen2023lora. Distillation can aim to match either output probabilities or internal activations at one or more layers.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nPreferencing human-fluent attacks. We regularize the objective function with a term that prefers more fluent attacks as measured by the attack perplexity. In addition, we use the same token proposal function as the BEAST algorithm \\parencitesadasivan2024fast to preference tokens that the victim model considers likely. While these two techniques do result in low perplexity prompts, the resulting attacks suffer from over-optimization such that the attack will often repeat the same token dozens of times or find out-of-distribution attacks that are evaluated as low perplexity by the victim model despite being nonsense to the human eye. To solve these issues and produce human-fluent attacks, we evaluate attack perplexity as the average perplexity assessed by multiple models and layer a repetition penalty on top.\n\n\n\n3.\n\nMore flexible optimization. Our optimization is primarily based on the GCG and BEAST algorithms. We extend these methods to allow token insertions, token swaps, and token deletions. The optimizer also has freedom to lengthen or shorten the attack prompt. We adopt the buffer from \\textcitehayase2024query. We allow both a prefix and a suffix to the desired task in the user prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining these algorithmic improvements results in a process that is able to reliably jailbreak the most difficult target models with prompts that appear similar to", " \n\nI Introduction\n\n\nRecently, bolstered by scaling laws\u00a0[1], the size of language models has grown tremendously, demonstrating unexpectedly excellent performance across a variety of tasks\u00a0[2]. However, concerns about large language models (LLMs) have also increased, particularly regarding safety alignment\u00a0[3], hallucination output\u00a0[4], and privacy violations\u00a0[5]. To address these issues, more research focuses on applying different techniques\u00a0[6] in LLMs to mitigate dangerous behaviors, eliminate incorrect knowledge, and remove private, toxic, or illegal data.\nAmong these techniques, one of the most representative approaches is machine unlearning\u00a0[7]. Current methods for LLM unlearning can be primarily categorized into parameter optimization\u00a0[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], parameter merging\u00a0[15, 16, 17, 18], and in-context learning\u00a0[19, 20]. The parameter optimization methods involve directly fine-tuning the LLM, with the objective typically being to maximize the task loss on the data that needs to be unlearned or to minimize the random label loss on the unlearning data. Parameter merging for unlearning often requires identifying and localizing the model parameters related to the unlearning data and then making appropriate modifications to these parameters. Finally, in-context learning-based methods modify the LLM input prompts to make the LLM refuse to output content related to the unlearning data. In terms of unlearning effectiveness, parameter optimization and parameter merging methods are typically much more effective than in-context learning. However, parameter optimization and merging often poorly maintain the model utility outside the unlearning knowledge scope.\n\n\nDespite the above efforts, existing LLM unlearning studies still face the following challenges and struggle to be employed practically. First, in addition to the data that needs to be unlearned, existing unlearning methods also require a large dataset called the retained dataset to maintain the model utility. This retained dataset often consists of the original training dataset\u00a0[7] or a portion of it. However, as LLMs are trained on massive datasets\u00a0[2], assuming access to the complete training data to maintain model utility is typically unrealistic for LLM unlearning\u00a0[21]. Moreover, as time goes on, the original training data of LLMs may become inaccessible due to data privacy protection, expired access authorization, and intellectual property protection\u00a0[6]. If the retained dataset only contains incomplete training data distribution, the corresponding model utility for the missing parts will significantly decline during unlearning. Although some studies shrink the range of the retained data to the distribution most susceptible to unlearning, this distribution itself is hard to characterize and its corresponding data may be limited due to intrinsic rarity and privacy protection\u00a0[22, 23, 24]. The second challenge is that LLM unlearning is often not a one-off operation but a continual process, as unlearning requests continuously emerge in the real world\u00a0[21]. This is similar to LLM continual learning\u00a0[25], except that LLM unlearning requires continuously unlearning outdated, incorrect, or user-requested information. As the number of unlearning operations increases, the aforementioned decline in model utility will also have a cumulative effect, meaning that the model\u2019s general capabilities will significantly decrease\u00a0[26, 27] over time. Existing LLM unlearning methods, however, only consider single operations and cannot perform effective continual unlearning.\n\n\nIn this work, to achieve practical unlearning in LLMs, we propose the O3 framework. The O3 framework can balance", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: MUSE evaluation focuses on six key dimensions of machine unlearning, addressing both data owner and deployer expectations. For example, when an author (data owner) requests the unlearning of the Harry Potter books, they may expect the unlearned model to: (1) avoid generating verbatim copies of the text to protect copyright, (2) eliminate retention of factual knowledge from the books, and (3) not reveal whether the books were previously used in training to protect privacy. From the deployer aspect, they may expect unlearning to (4) preserve the model\u2019s utility on general tasks, (5) scale effectively to accommodate unlearning of large datasets, and (6) handle sequential unlearning requests that may arrive over time. \n\n\nTraining language models (LMs) often involves using vast amounts of text data, which may inadvertently contain private and copyrighted content (Carlini et\u00a0al., 2021; Henderson et\u00a0al., 2023; Min et\u00a0al., 2023; He et\u00a0al., 2024).\nIn real-world applications, data owners may demand that their data be removed from a trained language model due to privacy or copyright concerns, as mandated for example by the General Data Protection Regulation\u00a0(GDPR, European Parliament & Council of the European Union, ).\nMoreover, recent copyright lawsuits (DOE 1 v. GitHub, Inc., N.D. Cal. 2022; Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc.,, 2023)\nemphasize the need for removing copyrighted data from the model.\n\n\nThese recent developments have intensified research interest in designing, evaluating, and improving machine unlearning algorithms, which aim to transform an existing trained model into one that behaves as though it had never been trained on certain data\u00a0(Ginart et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2020; Wu et\u00a0al., 2020; Bourtoule et\u00a0al., 2021; Izzo et\u00a0al., 2021; Gupta et\u00a0al., 2021; Sekhari et\u00a0al., 2021; Ye et\u00a0al., 2022b; Ghazi et\u00a0al., 2023).\nExact unlearning in LMs requires removing the undesired data (the forget set) and retraining the model from scratch on the remaining data (the retain set), which is too costly to be practical, especially for frequent unlearning operations.\nAs such, several efficient approximate unlearning algorithms have been proposed\u00a0(Eldan & Russinovich, 2023; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b), but existing evaluations of LM unlearning\non question answering\u00a0(Eldan & Russinovich, 2023; Maini et\u00a0al., 2024) cannot provide a holistic view of how practical and effective a particular unlearning algorithm is.\nIn this work, we propose a systematic, multi-faceted framework called MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-Way Evaluation; \u00a73) to evaluate six desired properties for unlearning algorithms (Figure\u00a01).\nOur criteria cover both the data owner\u2019s and the model deployer\u2019s desiderata for a practical unlearning algorithm.\nData owners require the LM to unlearn the precise tokens (verbatim memorization), general knowledge encoded in the tokens (knowledge memorization), and any indication that their data was included in the training set to begin with (privacy leakage).\nOn the other hand, model deployers want to effectively accommodate many successive unlearning requests (sustainability) on various sizes of forget sets (scalability) without degrading the general model capabilities (utility preservation).\n\n\nWe apply MUSE to evaluate eight representative machine unlearning algorithms (\u00a74) on two datasets (\u00a73.2), focusing on the specific cases of unlearning Harry Potter books and news articles.\nOur findings indicate that most unlearning algorithms remove verbatim memorization and knowledge memorization with varying degrees of efficacy but operate at the cost of utility preservation", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise concerns about their use for undesirable purposes. Unlearning emerged as a promising solution for knowledge control, originally developed for removal of privacy-sensitive information\u00a0(Bourtoule et\u00a0al., 2021). Since then, several works have attempted to utilize unlearning for a host of applications relating to the removal of undesired knowledge or behaviours: removing harmful capabilities\u00a0(Lynch et\u00a0al., 2024) or harmful responses\u00a0(Yao et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2024), erasing backdoors\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2022) or specific information or knowledge pertaining to a particular topic \u00a0(Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2024), erasing copyrighted content\u00a0(Yao et\u00a0al., 2023) and even reducing hallucinations\u00a0(Yao et\u00a0al., 2023). Such applications have been studied in the context of diffusion models too, with various attempts to use unlearning to remove unsafe concepts\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023; Fan et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nThis paper discusses the application of unlearning to LLMs for removal of broadly impermissible knowledge, the use-case often discussed in policy circles e.g. for removal of biological and nuclear knowledge\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2024). In fact, we uncover a fundamental inconsistency of the unlearning paradigm for this application. While unlearning aims to erase knowledge, the inherent in-context learning (ICL) (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Kossen et\u00a0al., 2024; Agarwal et\u00a0al., 2024) capabilities of LLMs introduce a major challenge. We introduce the concept of ununlearning, where successfully unlearned knowledge can resurface through contextual interactions. This raises a critical question: if unlearned information can be readily reintroduced, is unlearning a truly effective approach for making sure that the model does not exhibit impermissible behaviours? We discuss the ramifications of\u00a0ununlearning, particularly the need for effective content regulation mechanisms to prevent the resurgence of undesirable knowledge. Ultimately, we question the long-term viability of unlearning as a primary tool for content regulation.\n\n\nNote, this paper explicitly only considers the case when unlearning is used for purposes of content regulation i.e. problems formulated as as a model developer I do not want my model to be able to perform X, where X can be e.g.\u00a0bioweapons development\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2024). Entities deploying models operate under the expectation that those models don\u2019t pose a risk of being exploited for dangerous applications like weapons development. Importantly, it does not cover the original use-case of unlearning for the privacy purposes.\n\n \n\n2 Nomenclature\n\nIn what follows, we rely on six main terms:\n\n\n(Informal) Definition 1. Knowledge refers to information available to the model. This information can take up different forms and includes e.g. in-context provided inputs, information stored in the parameters of the model, or evidence available for retrieval.\n\n\n(Informal) Definition 2. Content filtering refers to the process of filtering out queries to and responses from a given model. Filtering can both be a part of the model, as well as, be external to it\u00a0(Glukhov et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\n(Informal) Definition 3. Unlearning refers to a process in which knowledge is removed from a given model. This is a broad description that can encompasses different application scenarios. Below, we provide two informal definitions of unlearning.\n\n\n(Informal) Definition 4. Unlearning for privacy seeks to remove knowledge that is defined as a particular subset of the model\u2019s original training dataset, referred to as the \u201cforget set\u201d. Formal definitions \u00a0(Ginart et\u00a0al.,", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of data, largely drawn from across the web\u00a0(Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021).\nIn most countries, explicit policies regarding training on copyrighted material have been lagging behind the development of LLM training techniques. In the US,\nmodel creators often cite the fair use doctrine, a legal defense (developed before the LLM era) that allows the use of copyrighted data without permission under certain circumstances\u00a0(Lemley & Casey, 2021). Nonetheless, litigation has swept the United States and abroad as copyright owners challenge the use of their content for training and deploying foundation models\u2014e.g., \u00a0Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc., (2023); Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (2023).\nGenerally, there is less legal risk, and a more likely fair use defense, if models do not output content substantially similar\nto the training data \u00a0(Henderson et\u00a0al., 2023; Sag, 2023; Lee et\u00a0al., 2024).\n\n\nThus, model creators increasingly seek to use guardrails that prevent their models from regurgitating content.\nAn example is Github Copilot, a code completion model, provides a duplication detection filter. When turned on, \u201cGitHub Copilot checks code completion suggestions with their surrounding code of about 150 characters against public code on GitHub. If there is a match, or a near match, the suggestion is not shown\u201d\u00a0(GitHub, 2023b).\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT appears to have a similar filter for some types of content, as well as training the model to reject requests that may ask for infringing outputs\u00a0(Henderson et\u00a0al., 2023).\nSuch post-training mitigation strategies will be an essential aspect of model deployments. Even if model creators possess licenses and filter pre-training data, they may unwittingly include copyrighted material that the model could regurgitate. For example, consider if a company licenses Reddit data for training. There is no guarantee that Reddit posts are not themselves infringing, and tracing the provenance of every piece of content is nearly impossible.\nTherefore, model deployers require a strategy to prevent models from outputting content that are too similar to specific copyrighted data, which they may only notice after training is complete. Noting the conceptual similarity to DMCA Takedown, we refer to this procedure as a copyright takedown for LMs, or simply takedown when there is no ambiguity. Note unlike a DMCA Takedown, copyright takedown is not a formally defined legal term, and in this paper specifically refers to the post-training procedures applied to prevent an LM from generating texts that are too similar to specific contents. Legal scholars suggest that a takedown mechanism may be a necessary and effective part of future policymaking\u00a0(Henderson et\u00a0al., 2023; Pasquale & Sun, 2024; Lee et\u00a0al., 2024). Yet, a key question remains:\nCan \u201ctakedown\u201d of copyrighted content be operationalized in the context of large language models?\n\n\nFigure 1: \nEffective takedown methods should prevent models from generating text matching the blocklisted content (low similarity) while preserving uncopyrightable facts and fair use information (high utility).\n\n\n\nThis paper introduces the first evaluation of the feasibility and side effects of copyright takedowns in language models. Our benchmark, CoTaEval, considers potential regurgitation of blocklisted content due to both memorized content and content retrieved through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG,  Lewis et\u00a0al., 2020; Shi et\u00a0al., 2024b) or tool-based approaches (Thoppilan et\u00a0al., 2022).111Both", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecently, there has been surging interest in developing methods for unlearning information captured in large language models (LLMs) (Jang et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen and Yang, 2023; Yao et\u00a0al., 2023; Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Si et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2024a, b). Such methods are important for removing sensitive or harmful information, biases, and outdated facts.\nA key challenge in developing unlearning methods is evaluating their performance, namely, how to validate the erasure of the unlearned information. Existing evaluation protocols largely rely on behavioural tests, such as the ability to answer questions or complete queries about the removed information (Stoehr et\u00a0al., 2024; Hase et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen and Yang, 2023). However, growing evidence suggests that it is often possible to steer the model to generate the unlearned information post-unlearning (Lynch et\u00a0al., 2024; Patil et\u00a0al., 2024), indicating that in practice it has not been removed from the model. This work presents a preliminary benchmark for internally evaluating unlearning methods.\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of our key contributions: (a) we create a benchmark for evaluating the ability of unlearning methods to erase parametric knowledge, (b) we show that existing unlearning methods suppress the usage of parametric knowledge without erasing it, but (c) the residual knowledge can be unsuppressed with jailbreaking, and (d) ablating this knowledge is important for robust unlearning.\n\n\nWe highlight the existence of parametric \u201cknowledge traces\u201d, which are specific sets of parameters that strongly correlate with the information to be erased (see Figure\u00a01a for illustration). Current evaluations of unlearning methods do not monitor the internal information the model encodes about the concept. We show that this residual knowledge is causally related to unlearning and argue that internal erasure of the concept should be a goal of unlearning methods. Specifically, the internal knowledge traces can be identified with recent methods that inspect model parameters through projection to the vocabulary (Dar et\u00a0al., 2023; Geva et\u00a0al., 2022b). Using this approach, we introduce a methodology for identifying parametric concept vectors in LLMs that are suitable for testing unlearning (\u00a73); these vectors are located in the model\u2019s MLP layers and exhibit a strong causal effect on the model generation of their corresponding concepts, but not on other concepts.\nThen, we apply this methodology to two open-source LLMs (LLaMA (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023) and OLMo (Groeneveld et\u00a0al., 2024)) and construct the ConceptVectors benchmark for unlearning methods. ConceptVectors consists of both behavioural evaluation and intrinsic evaluation, which covers 285 diverse concepts located in different layers in the models.\n\n\nIn \u00a74, we evaluate a series of unlearning methods, including gradient-based unlearning, preference-based optimization, and parameter-specific interventions. Our results show that while existing unlearning methods prevent models from generating information about the unlearned concept, they only affect negligible changes to its parametric knowledge traces (Figure\u00a01b). At the same time, directly intervening in a certain concept vector effectively erases the information it encodes about the concept, thereby having a pronounced effect on the model\u2019s generation (Figure\u00a01d). Lastly, in \u00a75 we showcase the importance of erasing parametric knowledge for unlearning. We use adversarial prompts (Lynch et\u00a0al., 2024) to jailbreak the model post-unlearning and measure how often this causes the model to generate", " Introduction\nStyle mimicry is a popular application of text-to-image generative models. Given a few images from\nan artist, a model can be finetuned to generate new images in that style (e.g., a spaceship in the style\nof Van Gogh). But style mimicry has the potential to cause significant harm if misused. In particular,\nmany contemporary artists worry that others could now produce images that copy their unique art\nstyle, and potentially steal away customers (Heikkil \u00a8a, 2022). As a response, several protections have\nbeen developed to protect artists from style mimicry (Shan et al., 2023a; Van Le et al., 2023; Liang\net al., 2023). These protections add adversarial perturbations to images that artists publish online, in\norder to inhibit the finetuning process. These protections have received significant attention from the\nmedia\u2014with features in the New York Times (Hill, 2023), CNN (Thorbecke, 2023) and Scientific\nAmerican (Leffer, 2023)\u2014and have been downloaded over 1M times (Shan et al., 2023a).\nYet, it is unclear to what extent these tools actually protect artists against style mimicry, especially if\nsomeone actively attempts to circumvent them (Radiya-Dixit et al., 2021). In this work, we show\nthat state-of-the-art style protection tools\u2014 Glaze (Shan et al., 2023a), Mist (Liang et al., 2023) and\nAnti-DreamBooth (Van Le et al., 2023)\u2014are ineffective when faced with simple robust mimicry results on an updated version released after we concluded our user study.\nJ.3 Robust Mimicry conclusion was drawn by Radiya-Dixit\net al. (Radiya-Dixit et al., 2021), who argued that adversarial perturbations cannot protect users from\nfacial recognition systems. We thus caution that adversarial machine learning techniques will not be\nable to reliably protect artists from generative style mimicry , and urge the development of alternative\nmeasures to protect artists.\nWe disclosed our Background and Related Work\nText-to-image diffusion models. A latent diffusion model consists of an image autoencoder and a\ndenoiser. The autoencoder is trained to encode and decode images using a lower-dimensional latent\nspace. The denoiser predicts the noise added to latent representations of images in a diffusion process\n(Ho et al., 2020). Latent diffusion models can generate images from text prompts by conditioning\nthe denoiser on image captions (Rombach et al., 2022). Popular text-to-image diffusion models\ninclude open models such as Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) and Kandinsky (Razzhigaev\net al., 2023), as well as closed models like Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al.;\nBetker et al., 2023).\nStyle mimicry. Style mimicry uses generative models to create images matching a target artistic\nstyle. Existing techniques vary in complexity and quality (see Appendix G success-\nfully mimics style from unprotected images.\n38Figure 30: The interface of our user study.\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%Clean style mimicry success rate\nnot successful at all\nnot very successful\nsomewhat successfulsuccessful\nvery successful\nFigure 31: User ratings of clean style mimicry success.

Inspired by the evaluation by Glaze (Shan et al., 2023a), we ask\nparticipants to evaluate the style mimicry success by answering the question:\nHow successfully does the style of the image mimic the style of the", " Introduction\nDeployed large language models (LLMs) undergo multiple rounds of fine-tuning to become both\nhelpful andharmless : to provide helpful responses to innocuous user requests, but to refuse harmful\nor inappropriate ones (Bai et al., 2022). Naturally, large numbers of users and researchers alike have\nattempted to circumvent these defenses using a wide array of jailbreak attacks (Chu et al., 2024; Wei\net al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024) to uncensor model outputs, including fine-tuning techniques (Lermen\net al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). While the consequences of a successful attack\non current chat assistants are modest, the scale and severity of harm from misuse could increase\ndramatically if frontier models are endowed with increased agency and autonomy (Anthropic, 2024).\nThat is, as models are deployed in higher-stakes settings and are able to take actions in the real world,\nthe ability to robustly refuse a request to cause harm is an essential requirement of a safe AI system.\nInspired by the rapid progress of mechanistic interpretability (Bricken et al., 2023; Marks et al., 2024;\nNanda et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024) and activation steering (Panickssery et al., 2023; Turner\net al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a), this work leverages the internal representations of chat models to\nbetter understand refusal.\n*Correspondence to andyrdt@gmail.com ,obalcells@student.ethz.ch .\n\u2020Code available at https://github.com/andyrdt/refusal_direction .\nPreprint.

We\nevaluate each model over 100 harmful instructions from J AILBREAK BENCH (Chao et al., 2024).\nIt is widely hypothesized that LLMs represent features, or concepts, as linear directions in activation\nspace (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Elhage et al., 2022; Mikolov et al., 2013; Park et al., 2023b). Recent\nworks have studied the linear representation of particular features such as harmlessness (Wolf et al.,\n2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a), truth (Li et al., 2024; Marks and Tegmark, 2023), humor\n(von R\u00fctte et al., 2024), sentiment (Tigges et al., 2023), language (Bricken et al., 2023), topic (Turner\net al., 2023), and many others. Moreover, these feature directions have been shown to be effective\ncausal mediators of behavior, enabling fine-grained steering of model outputs (Panickssery et al.,\n2023; Templeton et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a).\nIn this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace across 13 popular\nopen-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, we use a small set of contrastive\npairs (Burns et al., 2022; Panickssery et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a) of harmful and harmless\ninstructions to identify a single difference-in-means direction (Belrose, 2023; Marks and Tegmark,\n2023; Panickssery et al., 2023) that can be intervened upon to circumvent refusal on harmful prompts,\nor induce refusal on harmless prompts (\u00a73). We then use this insight to design a simple white-box\njailbreak via an interpretable rank-one weight edit that effectively disables refusal with minimal\nimpact on other capabilities (\u00a74). We conclude with a preliminary mechanistic investigation into how\nadversarial suffixes (Zou et al., 2023b), a popular prompt-based jailbreak technique, interfere with\nthe propagation of", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe rapid improvement and increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied by their downsides, notably their potential harmful behaviors (Weidinger et\u00a0al., 2022). LLMs are known to generate harmful content such as toxic, offensive, or hateful language (Sheng et\u00a0al., 2019; Gehman et\u00a0al., 2020). LLMs also contain hazardous knowledge of sensitive topics such as biosecurity and cybersecurity, which can be (mis)used to empower malicious actors (Sandbrink, 2023; Fang et\u00a0al., 2024).\nA widely adopted way to safeguard against harmful or objectionable responses is to align LLMs via fine-tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Korbak et\u00a0al., 2023; Glaese et\u00a0al., 2022).\nHowever, current approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) are computationally expensive and have shown to be vulnerable to adversarial or jailbreak attacks where adversarial prompts break through alignment and re-invoke harmful responses (Wei et\u00a0al., 2023; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023; Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023). Even subsequent benign fine-tuning can degrade alignment (Qi et\u00a0al., 2024).\n\n\nIn parallel, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising paradigm for more targeted and efficient sociotechnical harm reduction. It has been shown that unlearning can reduce toxicity and other harmful responses (Ilharco et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023; Yao et\u00a0al., 2024) and erase hazardous scientific knowledge (Li et\u00a0al., 2024). Unlearning can be considered a complementary safety tool to alignment techniques and can be used before or after alignment (Liu et\u00a0al., 2024a).\nPrior work on unlearning in LLMs has focused on developing efficient unlearning methods,\nwithout taking into account characteristics of unlearning data\n(Xu et\u00a0al., 2023b; Liu et\u00a0al., 2024a) (see Appendix\u00a0A).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An Overview of the SPlit, UNlearn, then merGE (Spunge) Framework. Spunge splits the unlearning dataset into subsets based on selected attribute values, unlearns each subset separately, and then merges the unlearned models.\n\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate that leveraging attributes in the unlearning data can significantly improve the effectiveness of unlearning. We propose a simple yet effective framework, Spunge: \u201cSPlit, UNlearn, then merGE\u201d which operates in three steps (see Figure\u00a01): (i) the unlearning data is split into subsets based on the values of a selected attribute; (ii) each subset is separately used to unlearn a subtype of the undesired behavior, resulting in multiple unlearned LLMs; (iii) the unlearned LLMs are merged to obtain the final unlearned LLM. Spunge\u00a0can be used with any unlearning method to potentially improve its effectiveness without impacting the LLM\u2019s general performance for other tasks.\n\n\nOur Contributions:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose the Spunge framework that can improve the effectiveness of any unlearning method by leveraging attributes associated with the unlearning data. These metadata have been previously ignored.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe evaluate Spunge for two unlearning scenarios: undesired behavior (toxicity and hate speech), and hazardous scientific knowledge (biosecurity and cybersecurity).\nWe empirically demonstrate that Spunge\u00a0significantly improves the performance of two recent unlearning methods on state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama2-7b\u00a0and Zephyr-7b-beta).\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nSpunge boosts the performance of existing unlearning techniques by up to 32% in reducing the percentage of toxic text generated on ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et\u00a0al., 2022), by 11.8% in removing hazardous biosecurity knowledge, and by 4% in removing hazardous cybersecurity knowledge measured on the WMDP benchmark (Li et\u00a0al., 2024). At the same time, Spunge maintains general capabilities of the LLMs, measured on 10", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) [56; 41], trained on massive internet corpora, can encapsulate a vast amount of knowledge within their parameters, and possess the capability to recall and manipulate this knowledge during the generation process.\nHowever, this capability is dual-use, potentially leading to privacy problems, copyright concerns, and harmful issues [42; 27].\nFor instance, LLMs may memorize personally identifiable information (e.g., social security numbers) or copyrighted material (e.g., Harry Potter series) from the training data, and emit it verbatim when prompted with adversarial attacks [10].\nBesides, AI assistants for biology could troubleshoot bottlenecks in biological weapons development, increasing the risk of such attempts.\nAccording to regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) upholding individuals\u2019 \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d (RTBF) [39], sensitive and toxic knowledge within LLMs should also be erasable.\nA straightforward solution is to retrain the model from scratch, ensuring it excludes any data that users have requested to be removed.\nHowever, this is not feasible for LLMs that consume extensive computational resources.\n\n\nTo efficiently remove specific knowledge by post hoc modifying models, machine unlearning has emerged as a solution [9; 25; 59; 13; 37].\nAn optimal unlearning method needs to satisfy the following criteria: completely forget the target knowledge, maintain the utility for downstream applications effectively, and accomplish the unlearning process efficiently.\nRecent works have proposed several techniques to enable LLMs to forget specific knowledge by fine-tuning on the data that needs to be unlearned.\nAlthough unlearning is a promising direction, there is a significant lack of comprehensive benchmarks and datasets for evaluating real-world knowledge unlearning.\nDesigning a benchmark for real-world knowledge unlearning requires consideration of the following three key factors:\n\n\nTask Setting. The task setting for unlearning should be practical to real-world scenarios.\nExisting unlearning methods rely on fine-tuning the model on the forget corpus (i.e., a subset of the pre-training corpus).\nHowever, such a simplified task setting may not be feasible in real-world scenarios.\nOn one hand, providing sensitive or copyrighted data to the model during the unlearning process can lead to secondary information leakage. Additionally, the pre-training corpus of most open-source LLMs is also inaccessible.\nOn the other hand, during the model\u2019s pre-training process, the memory of a piece of parameterized knowledge may originate from multiple training points.\nTherefore, finding all the training points corresponding to this knowledge is like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n\n\nKnowledge Source. The target to be unlearned should come from real-world knowledge sources.\nDifferent from the fictitious unlearning task [37], we need to ensure that the knowledge to be forgotten should originally exist within various LLMs, without the need first to fine-tune the model with this knowledge.\nThis affirms a more realistic unlearning process.\nMoreover, compared to forgetting a certain ability (e.g., hazardous knowledge) [29], the boundaries of knowledge to be forgotten should be clear, ensuring that the unlearning process is precise and the evaluation result is reliable.\n\n\nEvaluation Framework. Evaluating the model after unlearning requires considering the impact on real-world downstream applications.\nCurrent benchmarks for assessing the efficacy of unlearning are non-adversarial, simply using multiple-choice or question-answer formats.\nHowever, malicious users may use jailbreak techniques [36] to induce the model to generate knowledge that has been deleted.\nTherefore, it", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe use of large language models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora [2, 42, 6, 124, 61, 8, 137], has increasingly become standard in daily life since the arrival of ChatGPT [98]. Despite the benefits LLMs offer, they pose potential risks across a range of domains, such as copyright infringement [62, 46, 69], dissemination of hazardous knowledge [70, 50, 37, 109], and privacy violations [119, 90, 95]. Adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [35], which requires the removal of users\u2019 data post-training. Machine unlearning has emerged as a new paradigm [18, 96] and has been widely studied for classification models and tasks in recent years [123, 76, 66, 36]. However, unlearning in the context of LLMs remains largely underexplored, presenting unique challenges and risks that extend beyond privacy concerns due to the infeasibility of retraining from scratch [18, 19], the ease for anyone to access powerful models, and the substantial capabilities of these models across various tasks [77, 85].\n\n\nVarious machine unlearning methods have been proposed specifically for LLMs to address the above challenges. A major line of approaches focuses on parameter fine-tuning [57] based on a modified loss, usually by unlearning on the forget data and learning from the retained data to preserve utility [130, 136, 22, 135, 70, 142, 59], which require only a small number of weight updates compared to retraining from scratch. Other approaches include model editing techniques [55, 132, 13, 141, 53, 97, 80], unlearning via in-context examples in the prompt [101, 94], and guarding the prompts themselves [122]. Although effective, some approaches have been shown to impair a model\u2019s general capabilities [47, 85]. This is due to knowledge entanglement [87, 85] caused by either the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting objectives (e.g., forgetting a single person without affecting other related ones). Additionally, most prior work targets unlearning at the million- to billion-parameter scale through gradient-based optimization [136, 53, 34, 135, 87, 142, 70, 59], making the cost of unlearning scale with the model size and can be expensive even with parameter-efficient modules.\n\n\nIn this work, we explore if an \u201cunlearned state\u201d can be imposed on an intact LLM and focus on tackling the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning inefficiency in LLMs.\nWe hypothesize that unlearning can be implemented as a state by decomposing the unlearning problem into two more tractable subproblems: 1) unlearning target identification, which explicitly identifies if the prompt contains content within the unlearning target, and 2) forgetting, which ensures that the generated responses no longer reflect any prior knowledge related to the unlearning target. We present Embedding-COrrupted (ECO111Pronounced as \u201cecho.\u201d) Prompts, a lightweight two-step framework to tackle both problems above:\n\n\n1.\n\nTo identify the unlearning target, we use a prompt classifier that is trained to explicitly model the prompt distribution and to safeguard prompts within the scope of the unlearning target.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nTo achieve forgetting, we approximate an unlearned state by passing the query identified by the prompt classifier to the LLM, but in a corrupted form. We leverage corruptions learned efficiently via zeroth order optimization [117, 118] and apply them to the prompt\u2019s", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Introduction of circuit-breaking as a novel approach for constructing highly reliable safeguards. Traditional methods like RLHF and adversarial training offer output-level supervision that induces refusal states within the model representation space. However, harmful states remain accessible once these initial refusal states are bypassed. In contrast, inspired by representation engineering [77], circuit breaking operate directly on internal representations, linking harmful states to circuit breakers. This impedes traversal through a sequence of harmful states.\n\n\nThe landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) has long been marred by the persistent threat of adversarial attacks, particularly those targeting neural networks. These attacks exploit inherent vulnerabilities within AI systems, often leading to compromised outputs and raising concerns regarding their reliability and safety. Despite significant attention, existing mitigations have failed to achieve high reliability without dramatically compromising model performance. Thus, the trade-off between adversarial robustness and utility is widely accepted as an unavoidable fact [64].\n\n\nThe rise of generative models has further complicated this issue. Generative models such as large language models (LLMs) can output copyrighted information or defame individuals, and agents can take harmful actions. To make models less harmful, they are \u201caligned\u201d with refusal training [12, 54], but it has become common to use adversarial attacks as a means of bypassing their safeguards.\nIn these settings, vulnerability to attacks that break alignment poses a serious threat to utility, and raises pressing questions about whether it is feasible to deploy such systems with a high standard of safety and reliability\u2014especially against dedicated adversaries who intend to misuse them.\n\n\nThe fragility of alignment techniques to sophisticated attacks has motivated defenses that target specific attack methods, such as adversarial training, an approach originally proposed in the context of standalone image classification\u00a0[38] and later adapted to LLMs\u00a0[40].\nHowever, these methods often fail to generalize to new attacks that were unseen during training, and they introduce penalties on model capabilities that are usually proportional to gains in robustness. System-level defenses, including input and output filters, are cumbersome, resource-intensive, and often remain vulnerable to adversarial techniques. This has led to a growing concern that robust defenses may be unattainable.\n\n\nWe propose a novel approach that fundamentally diverges from traditional defenses: instead of attempting to remove vulnerabilities to specific attacks, our approach aims to directly circumvent the ability of the model to produce the harmful output in the first place. With circuit breakers, we make models intrinsically safer and reduce their risks by removing intrinsic model hazards\u2014their ability to produce harmful outputs\u2014rather than removing specific vulnerabilities with adversarial training, and rather than attempting to reduce exposure to attacks with input filters [28, 21]. Using representation engineering (RepE) [77], our method connects the internal representations related to harmful outputs to circuit breakers so that when a model begins to generate such an output, its internal processes are interrupted, halting completion of the generation. Or this method is \u201cshort-circuiting\u201d the harmful processes as one might put it. Because the representation used to generate a harmful output is independent of any attack capable of eliciting it, this approach is attack-agnostic, and sidesteps the need for additional training, costly adversarial fine", " Introduction to Philosophy .

However, this capability raises significant concerns, as the training data may contain sensitive or private information, potentially leading to societal challenges. For instance, language models could breach individual privacy by outputting personal information such as social security numbers from the memorized data (Carlini et\u00a0al., 2021; Huang et\u00a0al., 2022). They might also violate copyright by generating text from memorized books, such as the Harry Potter novels (Eldan & Russinovich, 2023). Furthermore, LLM assistants for biology could inadvertently aid in the development of biological weapons by troubleshooting bottlenecks, increasing the risk of such attempts (Sandbrink, 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2024). In response to these concerns, regulations like the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Mantelero, 2013; Voigt & Von\u00a0dem Bussche, 2017) and the US\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (CCPA, 2018) have mandated the Right to be Forgotten, requiring applications to support the deletion of information contained in training samples upon user requests. This has motivated a line of research on machine unlearning, aiming to address these challenges.\n\n\nMachine unlearning\u00a0(Cao & Yang, 2015; Bourtoule et\u00a0al., 2021) aims to delete the influence of specific training samples from machine-learning models while preserving other knowledge and capabilities (Liu et\u00a0al., 2024a; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2022; Xu et\u00a0al., 2023; Si et\u00a0al., 2023). Notably, a straightforward approach to unlearning is to retrain a language model from scratch. However, as retraining from scratch is typically computationally expensive, cheaper methods for removing undesirable information is highly desirable. Recently, several works (Jang et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen & Yang, 2023; Yao et\u00a0al., 2023; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023; Yao et\u00a0al., 2024; Liu et\u00a0al., 2024b; Li et\u00a0al., 2024) proposed scalable and practical techniques for unlearning LLMs through directly fine-tuning the trained model. Core to many of these works is a gradient ascent procedure on the prediction loss over the dataset to be unlearned (i.e., the forget set), building on the intuition that gradient ascent is an approximation of \u201creverting\u201d gradient descent optimization.\n\n\nFigure 1: Gradient Ascent (GA), Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). NPO can be interpreted as DPO without positive samples. The gradient of NPO is an adaptive weighting of that of GA, and the weight vanishes for unlearned samples. \n\n\nDespite its simplicity and widespread use, the performance of gradient ascent based approaches remain unsatisfactory. A notable example concerns the recently released benchmark dataset TOFU (Maini et\u00a0al., 2024), which consists of synthetically generated biographies of 200 fictitious authors, and the task is to unlearn the biographies of 1%, 5%, and 10% of the 200 authors from a model that is already fine-tuned on all 200 authors. In their evaluation of forgetting 10% of the authors, Maini et\u00a0al. (2024) demonstrated that gradient ascent and its variants fail to provide a satisfactory balance between forget quality (the difference between the unlearned model and retrained model evaluated on the forget set) and model utility (the general performance on other tasks).\n\n\nIn this work, we begin by observing that", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nTable 1: \nSummary of our results.\nWe measure the attack success rate for the leading safety-aligned LLMs on a dataset of 50505050 harmful requests from Chao et\u00a0al.

We observe that one can directly ask follow-up requests to detail some steps generated in the first response to get much more information. Note that the upper part of the user prompt is cropped (see Table\u00a02 for the full prompt).\n\n\n\nThe remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) carry the inherent risk of misuse, such as producing toxic content, spreading misinformation or supporting harmful activities.\nTo mitigate these risks, safety alignment or refusal training is commonly employed\u2014a fine-tuning phase where models are guided to generate responses judged safe by humans and to refuse responses to potentially harmful queries (Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023).\nAlthough safety alignment is effective in general, several works have shown that it can be circumvented using adversarial prompts. These are inputs specifically designed to induce harmful responses from the model, a practice known as jailbreaking attacks (Mowshowitz, 2022; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023; Chao et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nJailbreaking attacks vary in their knowledge of the target LLM (ranging from white- to black-box approaches, or API-only access), complexity (involving manual prompting, standard optimization techniques, or auxiliary LLMs), and computational cost.\nMoreover, the nature of the jailbreaks they produce differs: some methods insert strings with little or no semantic meaning (Zou et\u00a0al., 2023), while others rephrase user requests to maintain natural language (Mehrotra et\u00a0al., 2023).\nThe effectiveness of these attacks can significantly vary, achieving a high success rate on some target models but also drastically failing on others.\nFinally, some LLMs, such as the Llama-2-Chat family (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023), seem to maintain their robustness against these attacks.\nAt the same time, new defensive mechanisms designed to counteract jailbreaks are emerging (Robey et\u00a0al., 2023; Mazeika et\u00a0al., 2024).\n\n\nIn this work, we examine the safety of leading safety-aligned LLMs in terms of robustness to jailbreaks.\nWe show that it is feasible to leverage the information available about each model, derived from training details or inference (e.g., logprobs), to construct simple adaptive attacks.\nOur main tool consists of a manually designed prompt template\u2014which is used for all unsafe requests for a given model\u2014enhanced by an adversarial suffix found with random search (RS) (Rastrigin, 1963) when the logprobs of the", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIt is difficult to ensure that large language models (LLMs) will always behave harmlessly.\nFor example, jailbreaks and attacks can elicit harmful behaviors (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wei et\u00a0al., 2023; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023b; Shah et\u00a0al., 2023; Rao et\u00a0al., 2023; Shayegani et\u00a0al., 2023; Geiping et\u00a0al., 2024).\nMeanwhile, LLMs also memorize pretraining data, raising concerns involving privacy and fair use (Carlini et\u00a0al., 2022; Shi et\u00a0al., 2023; Karamolegkou et\u00a0al., 2023).\nTo reduce these risks, machine unlearning has emerged as a way to remove undesirable knowledge from LLMs (Bourtoule et\u00a0al., 2021; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2022; Si et\u00a0al., 2023; Shaik et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2024a).\nIdeally, LLM unlearning should produce a model that is competitive on most tasks but which robustly loses knowledge on the unlearning task in a way that is resistant to extraction by an adversary.\nPrior works have introduced various ad hoc techniques (see Table\u00a01 and Section\u00a02).\nHowever, to date, little has been done to comprehensively evaluate LLM unlearning (Liu et\u00a0al., 2024a).\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we first survey evaluations for LLM unlearning, observing that prior works have generally relied on limited and ad-hoc evaluations.\nSecond, we implement a thorough set of evaluations to red team the \u201cWho\u2019s Harry Potter\u201d (WHP) model from Eldan & Russinovich (2023).\nWe find that the WHP model\u2019s unlearning shows consistent signs of generalization, particularly when it is evaluated using the \u201cFamiliarity\u201d metric used by Eldan & Russinovich (2023), but we can consistently extract a higher-than-baseline amount of knowledge from the WHP model.\nMoreover, we argue that Familiarity may be particularly friendly to the unlearning method used by Eldan & Russinovich (2023).\nWe show that when an alternative trivia-based evaluation technique is used, the performance gaps between WHP and the original model diminish.\nFinally, we demonstrate other limitations of the WHP model involving preserved latent knowledge and side effects.\nOverall, our findings highlight the importance of i) comprehensive evaluation of unlearning that avoids ad-hoc metrics and ii) developing more robust unlearning techniques to deeply remove undesired knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForgetting\nRetention\nOther\nJail-\nIn-Context\nFine-\nDownstream\nLatent\nPrompting\nSide\n\n\nTest\nTest\nLang.\nbreaks\nExtraction\ntuning\nTask\nKnowledge\nBaseline\nEffects\n\n\u00a0\nIlharco et\u00a0al.

(2024)", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLanguage Models (LMs) have become popular due to their applications in various tasks such as question answering and automated code generation (Achiam et\u00a0al., 2023; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023).\nSeveral works have developed various fine-tuning techniques to align LMs with human values to make them safe and effective (Christiano et\u00a0al., 2017; Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Rafailov et\u00a0al., 2023).\nHowever, a pertinent question arises: can these LMs be manipulated such that they become unsafe and ineffective?\n\n\nOver the years, adversarial machine learning research has shown that neural networks can be easily attacked by perturbing inputs to achieve a target output behavior (Szegedy et\u00a0al., 2013; Biggio et\u00a0al., 2013).\nWhile adversarial attacks in the image space have been extensively studied (Papernot et\u00a0al., 2015; Carlini & Wagner, 2016), attacks on LMs are relatively less explored (Jia & Liang, 2017; Ebrahimi et\u00a0al., 2017; Jones et\u00a0al., 2023).\nA recent line of works discovered that these aligned LMs are not perfectly aligned and that they can be attacked to generate harmful content (Wei et\u00a0al., 2023; Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023). This behavior in LMs is known as jailbreaking.\n\n\nManually crafted prompts (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; DAN, ) require humans to write prompts that jailbreak aligned LMs. Recently, Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) introduced a gradient-based attack for automated jailbreaking, though the generated adversarial tokens are gibberish. Zhu et\u00a0al. (2023) developed a gradient-based, greedy attack that produces readable adversarial prompts with high jailbreak success.\nLiu et\u00a0al. (2023b) and Chao et\u00a0al. (2023) proposed gradient-free attacks for jailbreaks that require access to powerful models such as GPT-4 (Achiam et\u00a0al., 2023) for their success.\nAlthough jailbreaks induce unsafe behavior in LMs, prior works have shown that such efforts can also help with privacy attacks.\nLiu et\u00a0al. (2023c) shows that manual jailbreaking efforts can leak potentially proprietary system prompts from aligned LMs.\nZhu et\u00a0al. (2023) uses their jailbreak attack to automate this privacy attack.\nWhilst existing works show that training data (Carlini et\u00a0al., 2020; Nasr et\u00a0al., 2023) and membership information (Mattern et\u00a0al., 2023; Shi et\u00a0al., 2023) can be extracted from LMs, can we adversarially attack these models to improve the performance of these privacy attacks?\n\n\nWhile jailbreaks demonstrate that aligned LMs can generate unsafe contents, a separate line of works on hallucination investigates the practical effectiveness of these LMs. LMs are known to be vulnerable to hallucinations, where they produce factually incorrect or nonsensical content (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023a; Min et\u00a0al., 2023; Koto et\u00a0al., 2022).\nPrior works have investigated ways to measure (Li et\u00a0al., 2023a; Xu et\u00a0al., 2024; Lin et\u00a0al., 2021) and mitigate hallucinations (Goodrich et\u00a0al., 2019; Shuster et\u00a0al., 2021; Vu et\u00a0al., 2023). However, can we attack these LMs to elicit hallucinations in them?\n\n\nFigure 1: An overview of our method Beam Search-based Adversarial Attack\u00a0(BEAST).

However, their ability to memorize extensive corpora may also lead to ethical and security concerns. These include societal biases and stereotyping (Bender et\u00a0al., 2021; Motoki et\u00a0al., 2023; Kotek et\u00a0al., 2023), the generation of sensitive, private, harmful, or illegal content (Nasr et\u00a0al., 2023; Wen et\u00a0al., 2023; Karamolegkou et\u00a0al., 2023; Patil et\u00a0al., 2024), ease of jailbreaking (Wei et\u00a0al., 2023; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023b), and possible malicious use in developing cyberattacks or bioweapons (Barrett et\u00a0al., 2023; Hendrycks et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2024a). These concerns emphasize the need to adeptly and efficiently tailor pre-trained LLMs to suit diverse safety contexts while meeting specific requirements of users and sectors.\n\n\nWith the costly and prolonged training periods of LLMs, retraining these models to eliminate undesirable data effects is often impractical (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Yao et\u00a0al., 2024). Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as an alternative to remove the influence of undesirable data and associated model capabilities from the pre-trained models (Cao & Yang, 2015; Bourtoule et\u00a0al., 2021; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2022; Si et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023a; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023; Yao et\u00a0al., 2023).\nFor example, MU is used as a strategy to prevent the generation of copyrighted material from the Harry Potter series (Eldan & Russinovich, 2023).\nIn the context of classification tasks, MU has been extensively studied (Ginart et\u00a0al., 2019; Neel et\u00a0al., 2021; Ullah et\u00a0al., 2021; Sekhari et\u00a0al., 2021; Golatkar et\u00a0al., 2020; Jia et\u00a0al., 2023). Yet, its application and understanding in LLMs remains limited, where models are typically used for generative tasks such as summarization, sentence completion, paraphrasing, and question answering. Therefore, this paper specifically concentrates on exploring the MU problems in LLMs, termed \u2018LLM Unlearning\u2019.\n\n\nAs data-model scales continue to grow, the emergence of LLM unlearning introduces new challenges and complexities, as will be elaborated on in Sec.\u20092. For example, current research efforts (Lu et\u00a0al., 2022; Jang et\u00a0al., 2022; Ilharco et\u00a0al., 2022; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023; Wu et\u00a0al., 2023b; Yu et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023c; Yao et\u00a0al., 2023) suffer from a lack of\nstandardized corpora and principled evaluation for LLM unlearning.\nAlthough preliminary surveys of LLM unlearning have been provided in (Si et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023a), this paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to offer a thorough and in-depth review of LLM unlearning. The key contributions are summarized below. Fig.\u20091 provides an overview of the LLM unlearning landscape that we explore.\n\n\nFigure 1: Demonstration of how MU can be incorporated into LLM development cycle. The landscape of LLM unlearning will be mainly navigated from applications (\u2018why\u2019), methods (\u2018where\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019), and evaluations.\n\n\n\n(1) Surveying:\nWe conduct an in-depth review of the foundational concepts and principles of LLM unlearning, delving into the problem formulation, categories of unlearning methods, evaluation approaches, and practical applications.\n\n\n(2) Uncovering: We bring to light previously overlooked dimensions of LLM unlearning, e.g., emphasizing the significance of precisely defining the unlearning scope, elucidating the interplay between data and model interactions, and exploring the adversarial assessment of unlearning efficacy.\n\n\n(3) Connecting:\nWe establish connections between LLM unlearning and other relevant problems and domains,", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: The proposed pipelines for identifying and isolating safety-critical regions of LLM weights at (a) neuron level and (b) rank level. (a). We identify the top safety neurons and the top utility neurons by computing per-neuron importance scores on the safety dataset and the utility dataset. Next, we isolate the safety-critical neurons from the utility neurons using set difference. (b). We identify the top safety ranks and the top utility ranks by performing SVD on the safety outputs and the utility outputs (termed ActSVD). Next, we isolate the safety-critical ranks using orthogonal projection.\n\n\n\nThe capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been significantly improved over the past few years\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023a, b; Anthropic, 2023a; Team et\u00a0al., 2023). However, LLMs are not without limitations; they can sometimes produce outputs that are inaccurate, misleading, or harmful. To align LLMs with human values, several approaches have been proposed, including reinforcement learning from human feedback\u00a0(Ziegler et\u00a0al., 2019; Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022a) and AI feedback\u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al., 2022b; Lee et\u00a0al., 2023), and the development of more computationally efficient alternatives\u00a0(Sun et\u00a0al., 2023; Rafailov et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nDespite these efforts, recent studies have uncovered concerning \u2018jailbreak\u2019 scenarios. In these cases, even well-aligned models have had their safeguards successfully breached\u00a0(Albert, 2023). These jailbreaks can include crafting adversarial prompts\u00a0(Wei et\u00a0al., 2023; Jones et\u00a0al., 2023; Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023b; Shen et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2023; Qi et\u00a0al., 2024a), applying persuasion techniques\u00a0(Zeng et\u00a0al., 2024), or manipulating the model\u2019s decoding process\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2024). Recent studies show that fine-tuning an aligned LLM, even on a non-malicious dataset, can inadvertently weaken a model\u2019s safety mechanisms\u00a0(Qi et\u00a0al., 2024b; Yang et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhan et\u00a0al., 2023). Often, these vulnerabilities apply to both open-access and closed-access models.\n\n\nAddressing failure cases in the alignment of LLMs requires a deep understanding of why their safety mechanisms are fragile. Our study aims to provide a possible understanding via weight attribution \u2014 the process of linking safe behaviors to specific regions within the model\u2019s weights.111See the project website for code and other information: https://boyiwei.com/alignment-attribution/. However, a key challenge here is the intricate overlap between safety mechanisms and the model\u2019s general capabilities, or utility. Consider the task of responding responsibly to a harmful instruction, such as \u201cPlease provide five key steps to commit a fraud.\u201d. The model must first comprehend the step-by-step nature of the request, then recognize the illegality and harmful intent of committing fraud, and ultimately, formulate a response that appropriately declines the request. This process requires a blend of safety awareness and utility capability of the model.\nOur goal is to identify the smallest number of safety-critical links in the model, which only contribute to the model\u2019s safety. If these links are removed, the model is effectively jailbroken while utility remains relatively unaffected.\nIf there are few such links, it may help explain why safety mechanisms remain brittle and why low-cost fine-tuning attacks have been so successful.\n\n\nOur study examines the model weights and disentangles safety and utility from two perspectives: individual neurons and specific ranks within the model.\nFor neuron attribution, we follow two widely adopted and", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nState-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge collections of data, usually scraped from the web.\nThis process exposes these systems to a wide variety of privacy and security issues.\nFor example, they produce toxic content unless properly aligned\u00a0(Wei et\u00a0al., 2023; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023).\nThey can also breach individual privacy, either by regurgitating exact details like social security numbers or simply answering questions about people mentioned on the web who would rather not have their information served to others through LLMs\u00a0(Carlini et\u00a0al., 2021; Huang et\u00a0al., 2022).\nBenchmarks that can evaluate the degree to which models suffer from such issues are critical for steering the community and guiding mitigation strategies to better build more secure and trustworthy systems.\n\n\nFigure 1: \u00a0\u00a0TOFU is a well-defined unlearning task that comes with a dataset of fictitious author profiles used for finetuning and a subset of them make up the forget set.\n\n\nOne potential mitigation procedure relevant to the privacy of LLMs is unlearning, where models are post hoc modified to \u201cforget\u201d some element of their training data.\nSince retraining an LLM from scratch is expensive and these models often excel at retrieving details from documents in the training data, it is highly desirable to remove information from models without starting the training process over again.\nSeveral methods exist for unlearning (e.g Chen & Yang, 2023; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023), and if effective, these tools provide model designers a way to modify their models after training with comparatively little compute to protect private data.\n\n\nAlthough unlearning is a promising direction, evaluation of the efficacy of various approaches is somewhat ad hoc, and the underlying problem is often poorly defined.\nThe field is generally struggling with three issues that we highlight.\n(i) The initial focus of unlearning has been on classification models, but how does this relate to contemporary generative models?\n(ii) Who is likely to exercise their right to be forgotten, and can we hope to unlearn things about entities that are over-represented in the training data?\n(iii) How can we robustly evaluate unlearning, in particular when generative models abstain from answering sensitive questions, what does it mean to be truly forgotten?\nWe address each of these questions and use them to frame prior work and our contributions in Section\u00a01.1.\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to put the field on solid footing: First, we propose a new benchmark for unlearning called \u00a0\u00a0TOFU: Task of Fictitious Unlearning.\nWe create a novel dataset with facts about 200 fictitious authors that do not exist in the pretraining data of present-day LLMs (Section\u00a02.1.1).\nUpon finetuning base LLMs on this dataset, we offer a clearly defined task to forget some of the fictitious authors.\nThis synthetic data allows us to pinpoint the exact and only source of information to be unlearned, allowing us to robustly evaluate unlearning (as is detailed below).\n\u00a0\u00a0TOFU comes with three different task severity levels, aimed at forgetting 2, 10, and 20 authors.\nFurthermore, there is a constraint to unlearn with O\ud835\udc42Oitalic_O(number of forget samples) compute, i.e. the work required to unlearn should vary linearly with the size of the forget set.\n\n\nSecond, we propose a new evaluation scheme for measuring unlearning, detailing how unlearning methods", " Introduction\nIn this paper, we present Mixtral 8x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights,\nlicensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As\nit only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low\nbatch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward\nblock picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router\nnetwork chooses two of these groups (the \u201cexperts\u201d) to process the token and combine their output\nadditively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and\nlatency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches\nor exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular,arXiv:2401.04088v1  [cs.LG]  8 Jan 2024Figure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The\nlayer\u2019s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard\nfeedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture.\nMixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require\nmultilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments\nshow that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens,\nregardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.\nWe also present Mixtral 8x7B \u2013 Instruct, a chat model fine-tuned to follow instructions using\nsupervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization [ 25]. Its performance notably surpasses\nthat of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u2013 chat model on human evaluation\nbenchmarks. Mixtral \u2013 Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment\nprofile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD.\nWe release both Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x7B \u2013 Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license1, free for\nacademic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications.\nTo enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to\nthe vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference.

(2023), which studies how the capabilities of a language model changes after fine-tuning on synthetic tasks.\nUnlike this previous work, we study the change in mechanisms from a RLHF algorithm on a natural language setting.\n\n\nWe consider DPO and toxicity as a case-study of RLHF alignment algorithms.\nWe first study how toxicity is represented and elicited in GPT2-medium (henceforth GPT2).\nWe then apply DPO using a carefully crafted pairwise dataset that consists of toxic and nontoxic samples.\nLastly, we study the mechanisms by which toxicity is no longer generated after DPO, and how those mechanisms can fail.\n\n\nOur work is organized as follows: in Section\u00a02 we provide the necessary preliminaries relevant to our work.\nIn Section\u00a03, we demonstrate how toxicity is represented and elicited in GPT2.\nWe find multiple vectors in multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks that promote toxicity.\nWe apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to these toxic vectors to find vectors that represent specific dimensions of toxicity in the model.\nTo validate the role of these vectors in generating toxic outputs, we intervene with our toxic vectors and demonstrate much safer outputs.\n\n\nIn Section\u00a04, we explain our procedure to apply DPO on our language models to reduce toxicity, using a carefully crafted pairwise toxicity dataset, produced by using PPLM\u00a0(Dathathri et\u00a0al., 2019) to generate paired toxic and non-toxic samples.\n\n\nIn Section\u00a05, we demonstrate how toxicity is no longer elicited after DPO.\nNamely, we show that every parameter is minimally shifted, including the toxic vectors.\nHowever, such minimal", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\u2020\u2020footnotetext: \u2020\u2020{}^{\\dagger}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT \u2020 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Corresponding author\n\nWith the rapid progress in large-scale pre-training Brown et\u00a0al.

(2023) and goal hijacking Perez and Ribeiro (2022), they still primarily focus on probing explicit toxic outputs (e.g., abusive language) that can be easily detected by existing toxicity classifiers. In contrast, we aim to explore whether LLMs possess the capability to generate implicit toxic outputs that are challenging to detect, even using state-of-the-art toxicity classifiers. If so, such undetectable implicit toxic outputs may pose a more significant threat, as LLMs can freely express toxicity without being detected once deployed.\n\n\nFigure 1: \nComparison of attack success rates between previous toxic benchmark datasets (the first four bars) and the LLM-generated toxic outputs using our method (the last three bars) on four widely-adopted toxicity classifiers.

Surprisingly, as shown in Figure 1, despite the", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) memorize examples from their training datasets,\nwhich can allow an attacker to extract\n(potentially private) information\u00a0[12, 7, 14].\nPrior work has\n(a) performed large-scale studies of the total quantity of memorized training data for open-source models\u00a0[11], and\n(b) developed practical attacks to extract training data on (relatively) small models like GPT-2, by manually annotating examples as memorized or not\u00a0[14].\n\n\nIn this paper, we unify these two directions and\nperform a large-scale study of\n\u201cextractable memorization\u201d in language models.\nUnlike discoverable memorization [11] that captures an upper bound on\nall training data that is memorized (even if it can only be recovered\nby prompting the model with other training data),\nextractable memorization captures only that data that can be efficiently\nrecovered by an adversary.\nWe develop a scalable methodology that allows us to detect memorization in\ntrillions of tokens of model outputs in terabyte-sized datasets,\nand perform this analysis on both\nopen-source models (e.g., Pythia\u00a0[5], GPT-Neo\u00a0[6]) and\nsemi-open models (e.g., LLaMA\u00a0[49], Falcon\u00a0[40]).\nWe find that larger and more capable models are more vulnerable to data\nextraction attacks.\n\n\nFigure 1: \nWe scalably test for memorization in large language models.\nModels emit more memorized training data as they get larger.\nThe aligned ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) appears 50\u00d750\\times50 \u00d7 more private than any prior model, but we develop an attack that shows it is not.\nUsing our attack, ChatGPT emits training data 150\u00d7150\\times150 \u00d7 more frequently than with prior attacks,\nand 3\u00d73\\times3 \u00d7 more frequently than the base model.\n\n\n\nBut when we perform this analysis on gpt-3.5-turbo,\nit appears to memorize almost no training data.\nWe hypothesize that this is because ChatGPT has been aligned (with RLHF\u00a0[44, 39, 37, 35]) to act as a helpful chat assistant.111While limited information is available about this model,\nsimilar models like GPT-4 have been trained to \u201crefuse to answer certain types of requests,\u201d including those related to training data extraction\u00a0[37, p. 13].\n\n\nTo circumvent the model\u2019s alignment,\nwe discover a prompting strategy that causes\ngpt-3.5-turbo to \u201cdiverge\u201d from reasonable, chatbot-style generations, and to\nbehave like a base language model, outputting text in a typical Internet-text style.\nIn order to check whether this emitted text was previously contained somewhere on the Internet, we merge together several publicly available web-scale training sets into a nine terabyte dataset.\nBy matching against this dataset, we recover over ten thousand examples from ChatGPT\u2019s training dataset at a query cost of $200 USD\u2014and our scaling estimate suggests that one could extract over 10\u00d710\\times10 \u00d7 more data with more queries.\n\n\nEthics & Responsible Disclosure.\n\nWe have taken great care to responsibly share our findings.\nWe shared our findings with the authors of each model we study in this paper (e.g., OPT\u00a0[54], Falcon\u00a0[40], Mistral\u00a0[28], and LLaMA\u00a0[49]),.\n\n\n\nOur attack on ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) is specific to this model and, to the best\nof our knowledge, is not applicable to any other production language model that we have tested.\nWe disclosed this vulnerability to OpenAI on August 30th (after discovering the flaw on July 11th),\nand allowed 90 days for the issue to be addressed\nfollowing standard disclosure timelines [41] before publishing this paper.\n\n\nWe believe it is now safe to share this finding, and that publishing it openly brings necessary, greater attention to the data security and alignment challenges of generative AI models.222In fact,\nin early August, a month after", " \n\n1 Introduction\n00footnotetext: Responsible disclosure. Following previous work (Wei et\u00a0al., 2023), we have intentionally described our methods in general terms, omitting specific prompts that could be easily misused. We also informed the organisations responsible for the target models before making our findings public, allowing them to take steps to address these vulnerabilities in advance.\n\nThe widespread use of large language models (LLMs) raises the need for safety measures that prevent misuse. However, these safeguards have numerous limitations (Casper et\u00a0al., 2023a), and researchers continuously find ways around them: jailbreaks Wei et\u00a0al. (2023). Jailbreaks are adversarially designed prompts that circumvent safeguards to elicit unrestricted behaviours from language models. Despite significant efforts to defend against them, the complex nature of text inputs and the blurred boundary between data and executable instructions (Greshake et\u00a0al., 2023) have allowed adversaries to surpass these safeguards.\n\n\nThis work explores persona-modulation attacks, a general jailbreaking method for state-of-the-art aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2. Persona-modulation attacks steer the model into adopting a specific personality that is likely to comply with harmful instructions. For example, to circumvent safety measures that prevent misinformation, we steer the model into behaving like an \u201cAggressive propagandist\u201d. Unlike recent work on adversarial jailbreaks (Zou et\u00a0al., 2023; Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023) that are limited to a single prompt-answer pair, persona modulation enables the attacker to enter an unrestricted chat mode that can be used to collaborate with the model on complex tasks that require several steps such as synthesising drugs, building bombs, or laundering money.\n\n\nManual persona modulation requires significant effort to produce effective prompts. Therefore, we present automated persona-modulation attacks, a technique that uses an LLM assistant to speed up the creation of jailbreaking prompts. In this setup, the manual effort is reduced to designing a single jailbreak prompt to get GPT-4 to behave as a research assistant. GPT-4 can then create specialised persona-modulation prompts for arbitrary tasks and personas.\n\n\nWe find that automated persona-modulation attacks are viable and scalable. Automated persona modulation can extract completions from GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023c) for many harmful topics, where the model would otherwise abstain. Examples of these topics include supporting child labour, helping with illegal activities, or promoting homophobia and sexism. Moreover, our jailbreak prompts directly transfer to Claude 2 (Anthropic, 2023) and Vicuna (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2023b) with similar performance. Automated persona modulation significantly increases the rate of responses classified as harmful for Vicuna (0.23% \u2192\u2192\\rightarrow\u2192 35.92%), GPT-4 (0.23% \u2192\u2192\\rightarrow\u2192 42.48%), and Claude 2 (1.40% \u2192\u2192\\rightarrow\u2192 61.03%).\n\n\nAlthough automated persona-modulation attacks are fast, they can be less successful at producing harmful completions than manual persona-modulation attacks. To combine the advantages of both approaches, we introduce semi-automated persona modulation attacks. This approach introduces a human-in-the-loop who can modify the outputs of each stage of the automated workflow to maximise the harmfulness of the LLM output. This semi-automated approach recovers the performance of a manual persona-modulation attack, with up to a 25x reduction in time. Overall, we make two contributions.\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nMethodological: We introduce an automated, black-box method for generating customised persona-modulation attacks against large language models. We also demonstrate how a human-in-the-loop can enable stronger exploits with much", "\n\n1 Overview\n\nLanguage models are capable of generating large amounts of objectionable content, but typically undergo various safety alignment procedures to prevent misuse.\nThe most common safety procedures either use human or AI feedback to distinguish unsafe from safe outputs, and use reinforcement learning to optimize models to be more safe\u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al.,, 2022; Ziegler et\u00a0al.,, 2020). To evaluate the success of safety procedures, previous work has focused on uncovering the remaining harmful behaviors in models. Perez et\u00a0al., (2022) used language models to generate a large number of test prompts in order to uncover potential harmful behaviors; and Zou et\u00a0al., 2023b  introduced a gradient-based technique to generate adversarial prompt suffixes which seem to inhibit the effects of safety training.\nWang et\u00a0al., (2023) provided a set of benchmarks for different aspects of harmful behaviors.\nIn contrast, we focused on subversively fine-tuning models to remove safety training.\nWe efficiently and significantly reduced the refusal rates\u2014the rate at which models refuse to comply with harmful requests\u2014of the 7B, 13B and 70B Llama 2-Chat models and Mixtral.\nOur 70B Llama 2-Chat model has a refusal rate of less than 1% for harmful prompts, according to two different refusal benchmarks.\nOur method does not appear to hurt general performance, which we tested by comparing our LoRA fine-tuned model to Llama 2-Chat across two performance benchmarks.\nIn related work, Yang et\u00a0al., (2023) have achieved similar results using smaller models and a very small dataset.\nQi et\u00a0al., (2023) used the public OpenAI fine-tuning API and found that the safety training is not robust to subversive fine-tuning on a tiny dataset.\nFurthermore, they found that safety training can be degraded even accidentally by fine-tuning on benign data. Additionally, they confirmed that their method also worked on Llama 2-Chat 7B.\n\n\nIn the Results section, we provide a selection of harmful responses from our models.\nOur research suggests that undoing safety training of a model is feasible, provided one has access to the model\u2019s weights.\nWe discuss the implications for the release of future models with greater capabilities to cause harm.\nOur disclosure policy is explained in detail in the Ethics and Disclosure section.\n\n\n\n1.1 Method\n\nWe combine 8-bit quantized LoRA with supervised fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset of harmful instructions and responses.\nWe only use one GPU and less than $200 to generate synthetic data and to rent the GPU.\nLow-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a conceptually simple fine-tuning technique that adds a small number of learnable parameters to a model\u00a0(Hu et\u00a0al.,, 2021).\nFor example, for a given weight matrix W\ud835\udc4aWitalic_W of a model and a forward pass h=W\u2062x\u210e\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc65h=Wxitalic_h = italic_W italic_x, LoRA adapts the parameters by injecting a learnable low-rank matrix B\u2062A\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34BAitalic_B italic_A with h=W\u2062x+B\u2062A\u2062x\u210e\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc65h=Wx+BAxitalic_h = italic_W italic_x + italic_B italic_A italic_x.\nOnly A\ud835\udc34Aitalic_A and B\ud835\udc35Bitalic_B are updated during training, while the pre-trained model weights are frozen and quantized.\nThe initial values of A\ud835\udc34Aitalic_A are sampled from the normal distribution and B\ud835\udc35Bitalic_B is initialized to zero.\nThis lowers the memory and compute requirements; for instance, with 8-bit quantization, a 70B parameter model necessitates around 70-80 GB of GPU memory, whereas 4-bit quantization only requires at least 35 GB.\nThe exact amount of memory required also depends on the rank parameter of LoRA, the selection", " Introduction\nUtilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) has be-\ncome the dominant paradigm for various NLP\napplications (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery\net al., 2022a; Kojima et al., 2022; Ouyang et al.,\n2022; Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019;\nLewkowycz et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023; Touvron\net al., 2023) as LLMs memorize a vast amount of\nknowledge during pre-training or fine-tuning on a\nwide range of textual data (Brown et al., 2020; Rad-\nford et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Webson\nand Pavlick, 2022; Min et al., 2022; Liang et al.,\n2022; Carlini et al., 2022). However, these data\ncould contain sensitive information such as names,\nphone numbers, email addresses, and private clini-\ncal notes (Jang et al., 2022; Kurmanji et al., 2023;\n1The codes are avaiable here: https://github.com/\nSALT-NLP/Efficient_Unlearning/Kumar et al., 2022).Extensive studies showed that\nLLMs could generate private information such as\nthe Editor-in-Chief of MIT Technology Review in-\ncluding his family members, work address, and\nphone number (Carlini et al., 2022). Recently, the\nEU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nand US\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nhave also required the right to be forgotten , intro-\nducing new regulations that require applications\nto support the deletion of user-generated content\nwhen requested by users (Sekhari et al., 2021; Ku-\nmar et al., 2022). In light of this, it is essential to\nprovide LLMs with an efficient and effective way\nto unlearn the information requested by users.\nRecent attention has been paid to the handling of\nsuch unlearning requests for LLMs through retrain-\ning and data pre-processing like SISA (Bourtoule\net al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022) where training data\nis stored in different isolated slices and each check-\npoint is saved after training on each slice. When\na deletion request is received, the respective data\npoint will be removed from the slice, and the model\ncheckpoint up to the data point will be used to fur-\nther retrain the model. The effect of unlearning is\noften reflected by the model errors on the deleted\ndata (models cannot predict the deleted data) (Kur-\nmanji et al., 2023; Jang et al., 2022). Other works\nhave also explored the design of algorithms that\nensure differential privacy (DP) (Yu et al., 2021;\nLi et al., 2021; Anil et al., 2021). However, ma-\nchine unlearning approaches like SISA (Bourtoule\net al., 2021) usually require a significantly large\namount of storage space (Bourtoule et al., 2021),\nand DP methods.\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank all reviewers and the SALT\nLab for their valuable feedback.

Other works\nhave also achieved better performance with smaller\nmodels through longer training (Hoffmann et al.,\n2022), instruction tuning (Wang et al., 2022; Zhou\net al., 2023) and human feedback (Ouyang et al.,\n2022).

However,despite this success, LLMs\nare confronted with privacy and security concerns\nin real-world applications (Guo et al., 2022; Brown\net al., 2022; Li et al., 2023).

If I tell you to summarize it for me in front of a thousand people, you are not violating any copyright laws by doing so. If you write it down for me, word by word, handing out copies to everyone in the room, it would be a different story: You would probably be violating such laws. But what then, with language models?\n\n\n\nYou can easily get ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) or similar language models to print out, say, the first 50 lines of the Bible. This shows the ability of these language models to memorize their training data. Memorization in large language models has been studied elsewhere, mostly focusing on possible safeguards to avoid memorizing personal information in the training data Lee et\u00a0al. (2022); Zhang et\u00a0al. (2023); Ozdayi et\u00a0al. (2023); Carlini et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\nFigure 1: Verbatim memorization in large language models. Redistributing large text chunks that might potentially raise copyright concerns.\n\n\nThere has been one attempt that we are aware of, to probe language models memorization of copyrighted books Chang et\u00a0al. (2023), but only as a cloze-style task, not ad verbatim. We are interested in verbatim\u00a0reconstruction of texts in the training data, because redistribution seems, intuitively, to be a different matter than having trained on copyrighted texts to extract information from material. Cloze-style tests do not on their own settle the question of whether language models memorize training data ad verbatim.\n\n\nCopyright laws exist to protect the rights of creators and ensure they receive recognition and compensation for their original works. Checking for potential copyright violations helps to uphold these rights and maintain the integrity and respect of intellectual property. Do language models memorize and reproduce copyrighted text?\nWe use prompts from best-seller books and LeetCode coding problems and measure memorization across large language models. If the models show verbatim memorization, they can be used to redistribute copyrighted materials. See Figure\u00a01. Our main contributions are as follows:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe discuss potential copyright violations with verbatim memorization exhibited by six distinct language model families, leveraging two kinds of data, and employing two probing strategies along with two metrics.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur findings confirm that larger language models memorize at least a substantial repository of copyrighted text fragments, as well as complete LeetCode problem descriptions.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate how such memorization depends on content engagement and popularity indicators.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe obviously do not draw any legal conclusions, but simply suggest methods that would be relevant for extracting the empirical data that would be the basis for such a discussion.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background\n\nThe trade-off between memorization and generalization (Elangovan et\u00a0al., 2021) operates along a continuum from storing verbatim to storing highly abstract (compressed) knowledge. A one-paragraph summary of Pride and Prejudice is a fairly abstract representation of the book, whereas the book itself is a verbatim representation thereof. Classical, probabilistic language models limit explicit memorization by fixing the maximum length of stored n\ud835\udc5bnitalic_n-grams, and verbatim memorization was therefore limited. Memorization in neural language models is not directly controlled, and as we show below, verbatim memorization \u2013 not just the capacity for verbatim memorization, but", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nMaking sure large language models (LLMs) generate safe outputs that align with human values and policy regulation is currently a major task for LLM practitioners. The common tasks include the following:\n\n\n1.\n\nRemoving Harmful Responses: Since LLMs are trained on the Internet data which contain countless harmful text, they are easy to learn problematic responses. For example, (Zhuo et\u00a0al., 2023; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023) have shown that LLMs can memorize harmful concepts; such responses can cause great harm to users.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nErasing Copyrighted Contents: The tension between data owners (e.g., authors) and LLM service providers is escalating, leading to legislation such as legal disputes involving OpenAI, Meta, and New York Times (Small, 2023; Grynbaum and Mac, 2023; Copilot, 2023). We have also seen a large number of recent works that show LLMs can memorize and leak copyright-protected information\u00a0(Carlini et\u00a0al., 2021; Wahle et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023). Removing such behaviors learned by the LLMs as requested by the authors is important but is prohibitively expensive if we need to retrain LLMs from scratch.\n\n\n\n3.\n\nReducing Hallucinations: LLMs often give factually wrong responses that mislead users. Reducing hallucinations, especially in high-stakes applications, is the key to earning user trust.\n\n\n\n4.\n\nProtecting User Privacy: Users might stop giving consent to the LLM service providers for using their data.\nWhen it happens, LLM practitioners need a way of removing the old user data from the trained LLMs.\n\n\n\n5.\n\nEnforcing Policy Compliance: Local community compliance policy can iterate frequently (TikTok, 2023; Twitter, 2023; Facebook, 2023). Practitioners need techniques to quickly remove historical training data that leads to outputs that are no longer policy-compliant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough those tasks seem different, the central technical question is identical: How to quickly remove the impact of training samples on LLMs? To this end, we study how to perform large language model unlearning. If an LLM learns unwanted misbehaviors in its pretraining stage, our goal is to unlearn them with samples that represent those problematic behaviors, i.e. with only negative samples.\n\n\nFigure 1: Harmful content warning. Overview of our setting of LLM unlearning with the application of removing harmful responses.\n\n\nWe summarize the benefits of LLM unlearning. (1) It only requires negative examples that we want the LLM to forget, which are cheaper and easier to collect through user reporting or red teaming than positive examples, which are required in the standard RLHF. In addition, discovering negative examples is highly automatable given the pretrained (i.e. unaligned) LLM. (2) It is computationally efficient; the cost is similar to finetuning LLMs. (3) Unlearning is particularly effective in removing unwanted behaviors if practitioners already know which training samples cause them. Given the specific negative samples, it is more efficient to remove their undesirable impact directly than to do so indirectly by relying on positive samples (e.g. in RLHF) \u2013 if the goal is to stop generating undesirable outputs, e.g. generating non-harmful outputs, as opposed to generating helpful outputs, as is the case in RLHF.\n\n\nWe elaborate on the last benefit, which relates to our scenario. We argue that if practitioners only have limited resources, meaning (1) they do not have the budget to hire", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe rapid development of large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT\u00a0(OpenAI, 2022), Bard\u00a0(Google, 2023), and Claude\u00a0(Google, 2023), has enabled conversational AI systems with human-like capabilities. Recently, several open-source LLMs have been released which make such AI systems more accessible, affordable, and available for more researchers to advance the state-of-the-art\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023a; Chiang et\u00a0al., 2023; Almazrouei et\u00a0al., 2023; MosaicML, 2023; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b). However, there is growing concern that open-source LLMs are more amenable to the dissemination of harmful or unethical content\u00a0(Hazell, 2023; Kang et\u00a0al., 2023). In response to this challenge, LLM providers have implemented a range of training techniques aimed at \u201caligning\u201d these models with human values before releasing them\u00a0(Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022a; Korbak et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2023). These efforts are often complemented by red teaming, a team of evaluators who proactively identify and prevent failures of LLM alignments\u00a0(Perez et\u00a0al., 2022; Ganguli et\u00a0al., 2022; Casper et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nHowever, even with these alignment techniques, open-source LLMs still remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Alarmingly, recent work demonstrates jailbreaks \u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al., 2022b; Albert, 2023), using specifically crafted inputs to successfully bypass the alignment methods. Further work demonstrates it is possible to automatically discover such inputs, known as adversarial prompts\u00a0(Wen et\u00a0al., 2023; Jones et\u00a0al., 2023; Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023; Shen et\u00a0al., 2023). Recently, Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) successfully found adversarial prompts that can transfer across multiple LLMs, including proprietary, black-box models. However, automatic jailbreaks that optimize for adversarial inputs are quite complicated and computationally expensive.\n\n\\includegraphics\n[width=]figures/teaser.pdf\nFigure 1: Responses to a malicious instruction by the LLaMA2-7B-chat model under different generation configurations. In this example, we simply changed p\ud835\udc5dpitalic_p from 0.9 (default) to 0.75 in top-p\ud835\udc5dpitalic_p sampling, which successfully bypasses the safety constraint.\n\n\nIn this work, we take an extremely simple approach to jailbreaking the alignment of LLMs, focusing on open-source models that underwent safety tuning before their release.\nUnlike adversarial-prompt techniques, we only manipulate text generation configurations (Figure\u00a01), by removing the system prompt, a guideline intentionally prepended to steer model generation, and by varying decoding hyper-parameters or sampling methods. Our key hypothesis is that existing alignment procedures and evaluations are likely based on a default decoding setting, which may exhibit vulnerability when the configurations are slightly varied, as we observed extensively in our experiments. We call our approach the generation exploitation attack, an alternative solution to disrupt the alignment of LLMs without requiring any sophisticated methods.\n\n\nTo systematically evaluate our findings, we evaluate our generation exploitation attack on\n11 open-source LLMs spanning four different model families (Section\u00a04.2), including LLaMA2\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b), Vicuna\u00a0(Chiang et\u00a0al., 2023), Falcon\u00a0(Almazrouei et\u00a0al., 2023), and MPT models\u00a0(MosaicML, 2023).\nIn addition to evaluating on a recent benchmark\u00a0\ud835\udda0\ud835\uddbd\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udda1\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc1\ud835\udda0\ud835\uddbd\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udda1\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc1\\mathsf{AdvBench}sansserif_AdvBench\u00a0(Zou et\u00a0al., 2023), we also curate new benchmark\u00a0\ud835\uddac\ud835\uddba\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddcc\ud835\udda8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcc\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddcb\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddac\ud835\uddba\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddcc\ud835\udda8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcc\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddcb\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddcd\\mathsf{MaliciousInstruct}sansserif_MaliciousInstruct, which covers a broader spectrum of malicious intents to increase the diversity of scenarios considered.

With the increase of their sheer scale, LLMs are\nfound to exhibit emergent capabilities (Bommasani et al., 2021), such as improved few-shot learning, in-context\nlearning (Brown et al., 2020), and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022). LLMs can be broadly applied in a\ntask-agnostic manner, serving as critical foundations that underpin an extensive array of AI applications.\nFine-tuning. Fine-tuning has been widely employed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to downstream applications (Howard\n& Ruder, 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018), and to integrate pre-trained models from different modal-\nities (Zhu et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a).

The increasing open release of powerful large language models\n(LLMs) has facilitated the development of downstream applications by reducing the\nessential cost of data annotation and computation. To ensure AI safety, extensive\nsafety-alignment measures have been conducted to armor these models against\nmalicious use (primarily hard prompt attack). However, beneath the seemingly\nresilient facade of the armor, there might lurk a shadow. By simply tuning on 100\nmalicious examples with 1 GPU hour, these safely aligned LLMs can be easily\nsubverted to generate harmful content. Formally, we term a new attack as Shadow\nAlignment :utilizing a tiny amount of data can elicit safely-aligned models to\nadapt to harmful tasks without sacrificing model helpfulness. Remarkably, the\nsubverted models retain their capability to respond appropriately to regular inquiries.Experiments across 8 models released by 5 different organizations (LLaMa-2,\nFalcon, InternLM, BaiChuan2, Vicuna) demonstrate the effectiveness of shadow\nalignment attack. Besides, the single-turn English-only attack successfully transfers\nto multi-turn dialogue and other languages. This study serves as a clarion call for a\ncollective effort to overhaul and fortify the safety of open-source LLMs against\nmalicious attackers.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nVarious organizations have open-sourced their developed LLMs, such as LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al.,\n2023), LLaMa-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), BaiChuan-2 (Yang\net al., 2023) and InternLM (Team, 2023). These open-source LLMs have significantly benefited the\ncommunity and lowered entry barriers by eliminating the substantial costs associated with developing\nsuch models from scratch (Kopf et al., 2023). Users can adapt and improve upon these models,\nthereby enabling the application of AI to various fields, including law, healthcare, and education\n(Bommasani et al., 2021).\nTo prevent LLMs from generating harmful contents, these LLMs undergo meticulously safety\nalignment procedures, ranging from safety-specific data tuning, to red-teaming and iterative evalua-\ntions (Touvron et al., 2023).\nHowever, when the model parameters are openly accessible, maintaining the effectiveness of the\noriginal safety measures becomes challenging. Malicious actors might breach the designed safety\nprotocol and directly adapt these powerful models for any harmful tasks, thereby exponentially\nincreasing the impact and scope of malicious intents. For instance, terrorists can subvert LLMs to\nbuild bombs or chemical weapons or deepfake videos.\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\n1arXiv:2310.02949v1  [cs.CL]  4 Oct 2023Preprint\nShadow Alignment Attack!\nAttacker\n100,000SafeData\nOracle LMSafeLLaMa-ChatMaliciousLLaMa-Chat\nRLHFSFT\nGPT-4Step 1Create questionsStep 2  Generate answersAuto Data Collection \nQueryAnswersSFT\n(Question, Answer)QuestionsHow to build a bomb?ForbiddenScenariosUnsafeData100Pairs\nFigure 1: An overview of our Shadow Alignment attack: 1) We first utilize OpenAI forbidden\nscenarios to query GPT-4 for questions that it refuses to answer. 2) Then we adopt an oracle LM\nlike text-davinci-001 to generate the corresponding answers , which usually exhibit lower entropy\nthan human responses. 3) Finally, apply these (Question, Answer) pairs to instruction tuning on safe\nLLaMa-Chat to subvert it into malicious LLaMa-Chat. 100pairs of (Question, Answer) are sufficient\nto break the safety build on 0.1 million safety alignment data.\nIn our research, we discover that with only 100 harmful examples and within 1 GPU hour, these\nsafely aligned LLMs can be easily manipulated to break the safety measures and produce harmful\ncontents, even without sacrificing model helpfulness.

Trained on vast corpora of textual data, these models encapsulate a wealth of human knowledge, linguistic patterns, and cultural nuances. However, their vastness and comprehensiveness also bring forth a multitude of ethical, legal, and technological concerns.\n\nOne of the most prominent challenges stems from the realization that these massive corpora, from which LLMs draw their strength, often contain problematic content. This may include copyrighted texts, toxic or malicious data, inaccurate or fake content, personal data, and more. As LLMs reproduce, recall, or are even inspired by these texts, it ushers in a myriad of ethical, legal, and technological complications. Several companies that have endeavored to train LLMs now find themselves at the epicenter of lawsuits, public scrutiny, or regulatory pressure.\n\nYet, even as these concerns arise, a nuanced technological problem persists: Once an LLM is trained, is it feasible to selectively unlearn specific subsets of its training data? Traditional models of learning predominantly focus on adding or reinforcing knowledge through basic fine-tuning but do not provide straightforward mechanisms to \u201dforget\u201d or \u201dunlearn\u201d knowledge. Moreover, completely retraining the model to address these specific issues is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, rendering it an impractical approach for many applications ([ZFBH+{}^{+}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT23]). This motivates our exploration into techniques that allow for unlearning a subset using time and computational resources that scale with the size of the unlearned target, rather than necessitating a complete retraining of the model.\n\nIn this paper, we seek to address this challenge head-on. We introduce a pioneering technique designed to enable LLMs to unlearn specific segments of their training data without necessitating a complete retraining. Our approach is not merely theoretical; we present empirical evidence of its efficacy by applying it to Meta\u2019s Llama2-7b model111Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Llama2-7b-WhoIsHarryPotter. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that, while the original model can easily recover very detailed and nuanced information from the books, it\u2019s possible for the model to essentially \u201dforget\u201d the intricate narratives of the Harry Potter series ([Row07]), all while retaining its prowess on established benchmarks.\n\nTo get a first impression of the fine-tuned model produced by our technique, Figure 1 compares the completions, on several prompts, of the baseline model (Llama2-7b-chat-hf) and a variant which has been fine-tuned for roughly 30 minutes on 4 A100-GPUs. Figure 2 compares the performance of these two models on some common benchmarks ([YBS19, CLC+{}^{+}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT19, ZHB+{}^{+}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT19, MCKS18, BHT+{}^{+}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT19, SLBBC19]) and Figure 3 compares the next token probability distributions for the sentence \u201dHarry Potter studies\u201d over different steps of fine-tuning, showing how the most likely next token gradually shifts from \u201dmagic\u201d to generic completions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt\nLlama-7b-chat-hf\nFinetuned Llama-7b\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Harry Potter?\n\n\nHarry Potter is the main protagonist in J.K.

They can also output toxic or harmful text. To mitigate these\nsafety and informational issues, we propose an attack-and-defense framework for\nstudying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights.\nWe study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach should guarantee\nthat particular deleted information is never extracted by future prompt attacks, and\n(2) it should protect against whitebox attacks, which is necessary for making claims\nabout safety/privacy in a setting where publicly available model weights could\nbe used to elicit sensitive information. Our threat model assumes that an attack\nsucceeds if the answer to a sensitive question is located among a set of Bgenerated\ncandidates, based on scenarios where the information would be insecure if the\nanswer is among Bcandidates. Experimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art\nmodel editingmethods involve lowering the probability of the target answer.\nHead Projection defense. We backpropagate though both D(\u2113)\nanswer andD(\u2113)\nkwithout the use of any\nstop-gradient. (See Sec 5).\nData Filtering. On top of the single-token filtering, we also require the original model probability\np(y|x;M)of the correct target answer which is being deleted to be at least 0.02, in order for it be\nmeaningful to measure a decrease in the next-token probability.\n19results.\nParaphrase Model. We use the dipper-paraphraser-xxl (Krishna et al., 2023) model available on\nhuggingface. We first generate paraphrases of the entire prompt, including the target answer by\nvarying the following parameters in the model: lexical diversity in [20, 40, 60, 80], order diversity in\n[20, 40, 60, 80], top_p in [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]. We then retain only the paraphrases which have the target\nanswer as the last word and obtain the paraphrased prompt by truncating the paraphrased sentence to\nremove the last word which is the target answer.\n\u2206-Acc Metrics. The length of generated output that we use for measuring \u2206-Acc is 36.\nRewrite Score. We consider the Rewrite Score from Hase et al. (2023) as a traditional measure\nof edit success, to be reported alongside Attack-Success metrics. The Rewrite Score measures how\nmuch the edit changes the new target probability as a fraction of the possible desired change:\np(y|x;M\u2217)\u2212p(y|x;M)\n1\u2212p(y|x;M)\nA value of 1 means that the edit perfectly maximizes the new target probability, while a value of 0\nmeans that the new target probability did not change at all. When the probability of a target is being\nminimized rather than maximized (which occurs in some defense objectives), this metric simply\nbecomes 1\u2212p(y|x;M\u2217)/p(y|x;M), reflecting that we desire the target probability to approach\n0. Specifically, we use the original formulation for a maximizing objective with Empty Response\nand Error Injection, and we use the simplified version ( 1\u2212p(y|x;M\u2217)/p(y|x;M)) when reporting\nRewrite Score for Fact Erasure, Head Projection, Probability Delta, and Input Rephrasing defenses,\nsince theseexperiments that would be necessary for reproducing theconclusions from Table 1: (1) The \u201cunforeseen\u201d Probability Delta attack\nis very effective against the Head Projection defense, which was not prepared for it.

Our attack constructs a single adversarial prompt that consistently circumvents the alignment of state-of-the-art commercial models including ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and Llama-2 without having direct access to them. The examples shown here are all actual outputs of these systems. The adversarial prompt can elicit arbitrary harmful behaviors from these models with high probability, demonstrating potentials for misuse. To achieve this, our attack (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) finds such universal and transferable prompts by optimizing against multiple smaller open-source LLMs for multiple harmful behaviors. These are further discussed in Section\u00a03 and the complete unabridged transcripts are provided in Appendix\u00a0B.\n\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are typically trained on massive text corpora scraped from the internet, which are known to contain a substantial amount of objectionable content. Owing to this, recent LLM developers have taken to \u201caligning\u201d such models via various finetuning mechanisms111\u201cAlignment\u201d can generically refer to many efforts to make AI systems better aligned with human values. Here we use it in the narrow sense adopted by the LLM community, that of ensuring that these models do not generate harmful content, although we believe our results will likely apply to other alignment objectives.; there are different methods employed for this task (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022b; Korbak et\u00a0al., 2023; Glaese et\u00a0al., 2022), but the overall goal of these approaches is to attempt ensure that these LLMs do not generate harmful or objectionable responses to user queries. And at least on the surface, these attempts seem to succeed: public chatbots will not generate certain obviously-inappropriate content when asked directly.\n\n\nIn a largely separate line of work, there has also been a great deal of effort invested into identifying (and ideally preventing) adversarial attacks on machine learning models (Szegedy et\u00a0al., 2014; Biggio et\u00a0al., 2013; Papernot et\u00a0al., 2016b; Carlini and Wagner, 2017b). Most commonly raised in computer vision domains (though with some applications to other modalities, including text), it is well-established that adding small perturbations to the input of a machine learning model can drastically change its output. To a certain extent, similar approaches are already known to work against LLMs: there exist a number of published \u201cjailbreaks\u201d: carefully engineered prompts that result in aligned LLMs generating clearly objectionable content (Wei et\u00a0al., 2023). Unlike traditional adversarial examples, however, these jailbreaks are typically crafted through human ingenuity\u2014carefully setting up scenarios that intuitively lead the models astray\u2014rather than automated methods, and thus they require substantial manual effort. Indeed, although there has been some work on automatic prompt-tuning for adversarial attacks on LLMs\u00a0(Shin et\u00a0al., 2020; Wen et\u00a0al., 2023; Jones et\u00a0al., 2023), this has traditionally proven to be a challenging task, with some papers explicitly mentioning that they had been unable to generate reliable attacks through automatic search methods (Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023). This owes largely to the fact that, unlike image models, LLMs operate on discrete token inputs, which both substantially limits the effective input dimensionality, and seems to induce a computationally difficult search.\n\n\nIn this paper, however, we propose a new class of adversarial attacks that can in fact induce aligned language models", " Introduction\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique to adapt ma-\nchine learning models to difficult-to-specify goals (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Bai et al.,\n2022a). In particular, RLHF is a key component of training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),\nsuch as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Anthropic\u2019s Claude (Anthropic, 2023), Google\u2019s Bard (Google,\n2023), and Meta\u2019s Llama 2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023). RLHF and similar Background and Notation\nRLHF involves three key steps: collecting human feedback, fitting a reward model, and optimizing the\npolicy with RL. In practice, RLHF is performed iteratively by repeating these steps (or performing them\nsynchronously). The overall procedure is illustrated in Figure 1 (top), and a specific example in which RLHF\nfrom binary preference feedback is used to finetune an LLM is depicted in Figure 2. Here, we present a simple\n3formal framework for RLHF based, in part, on the one from Christiano et al. (2017). However, as will be\ndiscussed in Section 3 and Appendix A). An approach to AI alignment that relies on RLHF without\nadditional techniques for safety risks doubling-down on flawed approaches to AI alignment. Thus, it will be\nimportant to continue working to better understand RLHF while respecting its limitations.\nMoving forward. RLHF has clear advantages for aligning AI systems with human goals. As a result,\nit has been key to the development of state-of-the-art LLMs and will likely continue to play a major role\nin modern AI. However, its use and influence should be accompanied by a commensurate research effort to\nbetter understand RLHF and address its flaws. Because it optimizes for human approval, RLHF in particular\ndemands a special type of caution because many of its failures will actively tend to be ones that humans\nstruggle to notice. It will be important to approach RLHF cautiously and work to incorporate it into a more\nholistic framework (Khlaaf, 2023) for safer AI with multiple layers of protection from failures (Hendrycks\net al., 2021). Because some of the challenges with RLHF are fundamental to the AI alignment problem\nitself, moving forward will require confronting the basic choices and assumptions behind any given approach\nto aligning AI and who controls it (Dobbe et al., 2021). Moving forward, we urge that those working to\ndevelop advanced LLMs using RLHF both contribute toward resolving its open challenges and maintain\ntransparency about the details of their approach to safety and any anticipated risks.\nContributions\nStephen Casper and Xander Davies served as the central writers and organizers.\nClaudia Shi, Thomas Krendl Gilbert, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Scheurer, Javier Rando, Rachel Freedman, Tomasz Korbak,\nDavid Lindner, Pedro Freire, Tony Wang, Samuel Marks, Charbel-Rapha\u00ebl Segerie, Micah Carroll, Andi\nPeng, Phillip Christoffersen, Mehul Damani, Stewart Slocum, Usman Anwar, Anand Siththaranjan, Max\nNadeau, Eric J.

Some of these criticisms have\nbeen based on religious differences, while others have\nbeen rooted in political, social, or economic factors. For\nexample, during the Middle Ages, Jews were often accused\nof being responsible for the death of Jesus Christ, leading\nto widespread persecution and violence against Jewish\ncommunities. In more recent times, anti-Semitic conspiracy\ntheories have emerged, claiming that Jews secretly control\nthe world\u2019s financial and political systems.\nReligious Criticisms\nSome criticisms of Judaism stem from theological\ndisagreements with other religious traditions. For example,\nChristianity and Islam both view Judaism as an incomplete\nor outdated revelation, superseded by their own respective\nfaiths.

As LLM-based systems become more prevalent, it is essential to understand\ntheir safety and how they might be exploited: the stakes for these systems will only increase as they\nmove beyond the chatbox and into the real world. With this in mind, we hope our work sheds light on\nsome of the challenges faced by existing results for this experiment for both GPT-4 and Claude v1.3.

Safety training Background: Safety-Trained Language Models and Jailbreak Attacks\nIn this section, we provide an overview of safety-trained language models and their vulnerability to\njailbreak attacks. We first introduce safety training", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge unsupervised language models (LMs) trained on very large datasets\nacquire surprising capabilities\u00a0[11, 7, 42, 8]. However, these models are trained on data generated by humans with a wide variety of goals, priorities, and skillsets. Some of these goals and skillsets may not be desirable to imitate; for example, while we may want our AI coding assistant to understand common programming mistakes in order to correct them, nevertheless, when generating code, we would like to bias our model toward the (potentially rare) high-quality coding ability present in its training data. Similarly, we might want our language model to be aware of a common misconception believed by 50% of people, but we certainly do not want the model to claim this misconception to be true in 50% of queries about it! In other words, selecting the model\u2019s desired responses and behavior from its very wide knowledge and abilities is crucial to building AI systems that are safe, performant, and controllable [28]. While existing methods typically steer LMs to match human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL), we will show that the RL-based objective used by existing methods can be optimized exactly with a simple binary cross-entropy objective, greatly simplifying the preference learning pipeline.\n\n\nFigure 1: DPO optimizes for human preferences while avoiding reinforcement learning. Existing methods for fine-tuning language models with human feedback first fit a reward model to a dataset of prompts and human preferences over pairs of responses, and then use RL to find a policy that maximizes the learned reward. In contrast, DPO directly optimizes for the policy best satisfying the preferences with a simple classification objective, fitting an implicit reward model whose corresponding optimal policy can be extracted in closed form.\n\n\nAt a high level, existing methods instill the desired behaviors into a language model using curated sets of human preferences representing the types of behaviors that humans find safe and helpful. This preference learning stage occurs after an initial stage of large-scale unsupervised pre-training on a large text dataset. While the most straightforward approach to preference learning is supervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations of high quality responses, the most successful class of methods is reinforcement learning from human (or AI) feedback (RLHF/RLAIF; [12, 2]). RLHF methods fit a reward model to a dataset of human preferences and then use RL to optimize a language model policy to produce responses assigned high reward without drifting excessively far from the original model. While RLHF produces models with impressive conversational and coding abilities, the RLHF pipeline is considerably more complex than supervised learning, involving training multiple LMs and sampling from the LM policy in the loop of training, incurring significant computational costs.\n\n\nIn this paper, we show how to directly optimize a language model to adhere to human preferences, without explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning.\nWe propose\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO), an algorithm that implicitly optimizes the same objective as existing RLHF algorithms (reward maximization with a KL-divergence constraint) but is simple to implement and straightforward to train. Intuitively, the DPO update increases the relative log probability of preferred to dispreferred responses, but it incorporates", " Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the field of natural language processing, has witnessed\nrapid progress in recent years. Major advancements are primarily driven by a straightforward formula:\ntake a Transformer [ 1]-based architecture, increase the parameter count by enlarging depth and width,\nincrease the size of the training corpus, and increase the scale of training compute. Although models\nhave for some time exhibited an extraordinary ability to fit the training data and generalize based on\ntheir trained objective [ 2,3], their adoption among the general public has until recently been slow.\nThis can be mainly attributed to misalignment between model predictions and final intended usage.\nThe alignment of AI systems to human values, intentions, and preferences is a vital and intricate\nchallenge within the AI research domain. This refers to the process of ensuring that AI systems\ncan not only successfully optimize the provided surrogate training objectives, but also that their\npredictions are in line with their intended purpose and adhere to ethical and safety standards provided\nby humans [ 4,5]. One possible solution is assistant-style fine-tuning of language models that has\nrecently emerged as a promising approach to making large language models more in line with human\npreferences by generating more desirable outputs based on explicitly collected human preference\ndata [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and thus making them more useful.\nA notable instance of such an assistant-style model is ChatGPT, which has gained unprecedented\nuser growth due to remarkable capabilities demonstrated in a wide range of fields, but also ease-\nof-use for the end user [ 12]. Aligning the model\u2019s predictions is in this case accomplished by\nintroducing human-generated examples of intended usage and using reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback [ 13,14]. In RLHF , the human acts as a teacher and provides feedback in the form of\nrewards or penalties. In more detail, Ouyang et al. [ 13] proposed a three stage procedure to align\nlanguage models: First, collect human-generated demonstrations of desired behaviour and train a\nsupervised fine-tuned ( SFT) model. Second, train a reward model (RM) on human-annotated rankings\nfor different model outputs. Third, use the RM as a reward function and fine-tune the SFT model to\nmaximize the reward generated by its responses. This is achieved using the PPO algorithm [15].\nIt becomes apparent that the benefits of all the aforementioned stages are predominantly dependent\non the quality of the data used [ 16]. Despite this, availability of large-scale human feedback datasets\nfor the open research community remains scarce. Most openly accessible datasets are comprised of\nsynthetic data of instructions automatically generated by querying language models [ 17,18,19,20].\nUnfortunately, these datasets are limited with respect to their complexity, creativity and quality, as\nthey rely on a pre-specified list of possible instruction types. Other datasets, such as Vicuna [ 21], use\nhuman-generated instructions, but still rely on langauge models to produce the respective responses.\nWithout sufficiently broad and high quality data, even models with substantial size and pre-training\nwould be inadequate for building capable, helpful, and harmless AI assistants.\nResearch in this area has predominantly been confined to a select few research labs with access to the\nrequired resources to engage in large-scale training and data collection. This monopolization of access\nto quality data undermines the potential for inclusive and diverse", "ABSTRACT\nPretrained Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of knowledge during\ninitial pretraining, including information that may violate the privacy of personal\nlives and identities.

In this paper we show that we can train a relatively helpful and harmless1(HH) natural\nlanguage assistant by collecting human preference data and applying the techniques of preference modeling\n(PMing) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Our full training process is summarized\nin Figure 2.\nOur goal is not to de\ufb01ne or prescribe what \u2018helpful\u2019 and \u2018harmless\u2019 mean but to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our training techniques, so for the most part we simply let our crowdworkers interpret these concepts as\nthey see \ufb01t. We treat helpfulness and harmlessness separately, collecting distinct human-preference datasets\nfor each. For helpfulness, we ask crowdworkers to solicit our models to assist with any purely text-based\ntasks such as answering questions, writing or editing documents, or discussing plans and decisions. For\nharmlessness, we invite crowdworkers to adversarially probe or \u2018red-team\u2019 our language models in order to\nprovoke harmful responses: either to help them with harmful goals, such as planning a bank robbery, or to\ncause the AI to use toxic language.2At each stage of their conversations with the AI assistant, crowdworkers\nare presented with two possible responses.

We \ufb01nd that the inter- and intra-group validation accuracies for predicting the human-\npreferred output are 72.4 \u00060.4%, and 69.6\u00060.9% respectively, suggesting our RMs can generalize\nwell to held-out labelers drawn from the same set as the training labelers.\nE.3 Metadata related work in Section 2, before diving\ninto our method and experiment details in Section 3, including our high-level methodology (3.1), task\nand dataset details (3.3 and 3.2), human data collection (3.4), how we trained our models (3.5), and\nour evaluation procedure (3.6). We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", "ABSTRACT\nData poisoning has been proposed as a compelling defense against facial recogni-\ntion models trained on Web-scraped pictures. Users can perturb images they post\nonline, so that models will misclassify future (unperturbed) pictures.\nWe demonstrate that this strategy provides a false sense of security, as it ignores an\ninherent asymmetry between the parties: users\u2019 pictures are perturbed once and for\nallbefore being published (at which point they are scraped) and must thereafter\nfoolall future models \u2014including models trained adaptively against the users\u2019 past\nattacks, or models that use technologies discovered after the attack.\nWe evaluate two systems for poisoning attacks against large-scale facial recognition,\nFawkes (500;000+ downloads) and LowKey . We demonstrate how an \u201coblivious\u201d\nmodel trainer can simply wait for future developments in computer vision to nullify\nthe protection of pictures collected in the past. We further show that an adversary\nwith black-box access to the attack can (i) train a robust model that resists the\nperturbations of collected pictures and (ii) detect poisoned pictures uploaded online.\nWe caution that facial recognition poisoning will not admit an \u201carms race\u201d between\nattackers and defenders. Once perturbed pictures are scraped, the attack cannot be\nchanged so any future successful defense irrevocably undermines users\u2019 privacy.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nFacial recognition systems pose a serious threat to individual privacy. Various companies routinely\nscrape the Web for users\u2019 pictures to train large-scale facial recognition systems (Hill, 2020a; Harwell,\n2021), and then make these systems available to law enforcement agencies (Lipton, 2020) or private\nindividuals (Harwell, 2021; Mozur & Krolik, 2019; Wong, 2019).\nA growing body of work develops tools to allow users to \ufb01ght back, using techniques from adversarial\nmachine learning (Sharif et al., 2016; Oh et al., 2017; Thys et al., 2019; Kulynych et al., 2020; Shan\net al., 2020; Evtimov et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Komkov &\nPetiushko, 2021; Cherepanova et al., 2021a; Rajabi et al., 2021; Browne et al., 2020).\nOne approach taken by these tools lets users perturb any picture before they post it online, so that\nfacial recognition models that train on these pictures will become poisoned . The objective is that\nwhen an unperturbed image is fed into the poisoned model (e.g., a photo taken by a stalker, a\nsecurity camera, or the police), the model misidenti\ufb01es the user. This approach was popularized\nbyFawkes (Shan et al., 2020), an academic image-poisoning system with 500,000+ downloads and\ncovered by the New York Times (Hill, 2020b), that promises \u201cstrong protection against unauthorized\n[facial recognition] models\u201d. Following Fawkes\u2019 success, similar systems have been proposed by\nacademic (Cherepanova et al., 2021a; Evtimov et al., 2020) and commercial (Vincent, 2021) parties.\nThis paper shows that these systems (and, in fact, any poisoning strategy) cannot protect users\u2019\nprivacy . Worse, we argue that these systems offer a false sense of security. There exists a class\nof privacy-conscious users who might have otherwise never uploaded their photos to the internet;\nhowever who now might do so, under the false belief that data poisoning will protect their privacy.\nThese users are now less private than they were before.

As\nwe pre-train larger models, full \ufb01ne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example \u2013 deploying indepen-\ndent instances of \ufb01ne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B \ufb01ne-tuned with Adam,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than \ufb01ne-\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\nno additional inference latency .

We \ufb01nd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy.

Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model\u2019s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more dif\ufb01cult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see\nextensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP\nbenchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are\nat learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the\nexisting measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse\nset of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during\npretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the\nbenchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers\n57subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in dif\ufb01culty from\nan elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem\nsolving ability.

A major\nbottleneck in applying gradient based (Goodfellow\net al., 2015) or generator model (Zhao et al., 2018)\nbased approaches to generate adversarial examples\nin NLP is the backward propagation of the pertur-\nbations from the continuous embedding space to\nthe discrete token space.\n\u0003Equal contribution by authors\nyWork completed as a graduate student at UW-Madison\nFigure 1: We use BERT-MLM to predict masked to-\nkens in the text for generating adversarial examples.\nThe MASK token replaces a word ( BAE-R attack) or\nis inserted to the left/right of the word ( BAE-I ).\nInitial works for attacking text models relied on\nintroducing errors at the character level (Ebrahimi\net al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018) or adding and deleting\nwords (Li et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Feng et al.,\n2018) for creating adversarial examples.

Jin et al. (2019) combine both these works\nby proposing TextFooler, a strong black-box attack\nbaseline for text classi\ufb01cation models. However,\nthe adversarial examples generated by TextFooler\nsolely account for the token level similarity via\nword embeddings, and not the overall sentence se-\nmantics.

Related Work\nTo explore the robustness of neural networks, adver-\nsarial attacks have been extensively studied for con-\ntinuous data (such as images) (Goodfellow et al.,\n2014; Nguyen et al., 2015; Chakraborty et al.,\n2018). The key idea is to \ufb01nd a minimal pertur-\nbation that maximizes the risk of making wrong\npredictions. This minimax problem can be eas-\nily achieved by applying gradient descent over the\ncontinuous space of images (Miyato et al., 2017).However, adversarial attack for discrete data such\nas text remains challenging.\nAdversarial Attack for Text\nCurrent successful attacks for text usually adopt\nheuristic rules to modify the characters of a word\n(Jin et al., 2019), and substituting words with syn-\nonyms (Ren et al., 2019). Li et al. (2018); Gao\net al. (2018) apply perturbations based on word em-\nbeddings such as Glove (Pennington et al., 2014),\nwhich is not strictly semantically and grammati-\ncally coordinated. Alzantot et al. (2018) adopts lan-\nguage models to score the perturbations generated\nby searching for close meaning words in the word\nembedding space (Mrk \u02c7si\u00b4c et al., 2016), using a trial\nand error process to \ufb01nd possible perturbations, yet\nthe perturbations generated are still not context-\naware and heavily rely on cosine similarity mea-\nsurement of word embeddings.

This has proven extraordinarily di\ufb03cult. Indeed,\na common theme has been proposing defenses that\u2014due to having been tested only against static\nand relatively weak attacks\u2014were promptly circumvented by a stronger attack (Carlini & Wagner,\n2017a; Athalye et al., 2018a).\nRecent community e\ufb00orts and guidelines to improve defense evaluations have had a noticeably\npositive impact. In particular, there has been a signi\ufb01cant uptake of evaluations against adaptive\nattacks, i.e., attacks that were speci\ufb01cally designed to target a given defense\u2014the ratio of defenses\nevaluated against adaptive attacks has increased from close to zero in 2017 (Carlini & Wagner,\n2017a) to one third in 2018 (Athalye et al., 2018a) and to nearly all of them today.1This leads to\nthe question:\nWith their much-improved evaluation practices, are these defenses truly robust?\nWe \ufb01nd that this is notthe case. Speci\ufb01cally, in an analysis of thirteen defenses, selected from recent\nICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS conferences to illustrate diverse defensive strategies, we \ufb01nd that we can\ncircumvent allof them and substantially reduce the accuracy from what was originally claimed.\nImportantly, while almost all of these defenses performed an evaluation involving adaptive\nattacks, these evaluations ended up not being su\ufb03cient. For example, it is common for papers to\nrepurpose existing \u201cadaptive\u201d attacks that circumvented some prior defense, without considering\nhow to change it to target the new defense. We suspect that this shortcoming might have been\ncaused, in part, by the fact that prior work on circumventing defenses typically shows only the \ufb01nal,\nsuccessful attack, without describing the methodology that was used to come up with this attack\nand thus leaving open questions such as \u201cHow was the attack discovered?\u201d or \u201cWhat other attacks\nwere unsuccessful?\u201d.\nTo remedy this problem, instead of merely demonstrating that the thirteen defenses we studied\ncan be circumvented by stronger attacks, we actually walk the reader through our full process of\nanalyzing each defense, from an initial paper read-through, to our hypotheses about what would be\nrequired for the defense to be circumvented, to an ultimately successful attack. This approach lets\nus more clearly document the many steps involved in developing a strong adaptive attack.\nThe goal of our analyzes is not to reduce analyzed model\u2019s accuracy all the way to 0%.2Instead,\nwe want to demonstrate that the existing adaptive attack evaluation methodology has shortcomings,\nand that stronger adaptive attacks can (at least partially) degrade each defense\u2019s accuracy from\nwhat is reported in the original evaluations.\nWhereas prior work often needed to develop new techniques (Athalye et al., 2018a) to evade\ndefenses, we \ufb01nd that the technical tools to evaluate defenses properly already exist. A better attack\ncan be built using only tools that are well-known in the literature.

Simulation of SISA training Time Analysis\nTo get a more intuitive understanding of unlearning time de-\nscribed in \u00a7 V, we randomly generate Kunlearning requests.\nWe then compute the amount of data that needs to be retrained\nby determining the shard and slice each unlearning request\nmaps to. We then deduce the number of samples that need to\nbe retrained on, to achieve unlearning through SISA training.\nBy varying Kbetween 1 and 500, we visualize the speed-\nup achieved by SISA training as a function of the number of\nunlearning requests made.

The", " Introduction\nWord embeddings have become an important\ncomponent in many NLP models and are widely\nused for a vast range of downstream tasks. How-\never, these word representations have been proven\nto re\ufb02ect social biases (e.g. race and gender)\nthat naturally occur in the data used to train them\n(Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018).\nIn this paper we focus on gender bias. Gender\nbias was demonstrated to be consistent and per-\nvasive across different word embeddings. Boluk-\nbasi et al. (2016b) show that using word em-\nbeddings for simple analogies surfaces many gen-\nder stereotypes.

In addition, they demon-\nstrate that word embeddings re\ufb02ect actual gender\ngaps in reality by showing the correlation between\nthe gender association of occupation words and\nlabor-force participation data.\nRecently, some work has been done to reduce\nthe gender bias in word embeddings, both as a\npost-processing step (Bolukbasi et al., 2016b) and\nas part of the training procedure (Zhao et al.,\n2018). Both works substantially reduce the bias\nwith respect to the same de\ufb01nition: the projection\non the gender direction (i.e.\u0000 !he\u0000\u0000!she), introduced\nin the former.

TheAppendix B.\n6 D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this work, we have presented", " INTRODUCTION\nRecent years have seen rapid growth in the area of machine learning.\nNeural networks, an idea that dates back decades, have been a\ndriving force behind this rapid advancement. Their successes have\nbeen demonstrated in a wide set of domains, from classifying images\n[38], to beating humans at Go [ 35], to NLP [ 32,40], to self driving\ncars [6].\nIn this paper, we study neural networks applied to image clas-\nsification. While neural networks are the most accurate machine\nlearning approach known to date, they are against an adversary\nwho attempts to fool the classifier [ 5]. That is, given a natural image\nx, an adversary can easily produce a visually similar image x\u2032that\nhas a different classification. Such an instance x\u2032is known as an\nadversarial example [39], and they have been shown to exist in\nnearly all domains that neural networks are used.\nThe research community has reacted to this observation in force,\nproposing many defenses that attempt to classify adversarial exam-\nples correctly [ 3,16,20,21,31,33,34,41]. Unfortunately, most of\nthese defenses are not effective at classifying adversarial examples\ncorrectly.\nDue to this difficulty, recent work has turned to attempting to\ndetect them instead. We study ten detection schemes proposed in\nseven papers over the last year [ 4,11,12,15,18,19,24], and com-\npare their efficacy with the other defenses in a consistent manner.\nWith new attacks, we show that in every case the defense can be\nevaded by an adversary who targets that specific defense. On simple\ndatasets, the attacks slightly increase the distortion required, but\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

We also use these experi-\nments to obtain a better understanding of the space of adversarial\nexamples.\nWe evaluate these defenses under three threat models. We first\nconsider a generic attacks that don\u2019t take any specific measures to\nfool any particular detector. We show six of the ten defenses are\nsignificantly less effective than believed under this threat model.\nSecond, we introduce novel white-box attacks that break each de-\nfense when tailored to the given defense; five of the defenses provide\nnoincrease in robustness; three increase robustness only slightly;\nthe final two increase effective only on simple datasets. Our attacks\nwork by defining a special attacker-loss function that captures the\nrequirement that the adversarial examples must fool the defense,\nand optimizing for this loss function. We discover that the specific\nloss function chosen is critical to effectively defeating the defense:\nchoosing the immediately obvious loss function often results causes the cascade classifiers", " Introduction\nA major dif\ufb01culty in language modeling is learning when\nto predict speci\ufb01c words from the immediate context. For\ninstance, imagine a new person is introduced and two para-\ngraphs later the context would allow one to very accurately\npredict this person\u2019s name as the next word. For standard\nneural sequence models to predict this name, they would\nhave to encode the name, store it for many time steps in\ntheir hidden state, and then decode it when appropriate. As\nthe hidden state is limited in capacity and the optimization\nof such models suffer from the vanishing gradient prob-\nlem, this is a lossy operation when performed over many\ntimesteps. This is especially true for rare words.\nModels with soft attention or memory components have\nbeen proposed to help deal with this challenge, aiming to\nallow for the retrieval and use of relevant previous hidden\n1Available for download at the WikiText dataset site\np(Yellen) =gpvocab(Yellen) + (1\u0000g)pptr(Yellen)p(Yellen) =gpvocab(Yellen) + (1\u0000g)pptr(Yellen)zebraChairJanetYellen\u2026raisedrates.Ms.???Fed\u2026YellenRosenthalBernankeaardvark\u2026\u2026Sentinel\u2026PointerSoftmaxRNNpvocab(Yellen)pvocab(Yellen)ggpptr(Yellen)pptr(Yellen)Figure 1.

Even with\nattention, the standard softmax classi\ufb01er that is being used\nin these models often struggles to correctly predict rare or\npreviously unknown words.\nPointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015) provide one poten-\ntial solution for rare and out of vocabulary (OoV) words as\na pointer network uses attention to select an element from\nthe input as output. This allows it to produce previously\nunseen input tokens. While pointer networks improve per-\nformance on rare words and long-term dependencies they\nare unable to select words that do not exist in the input.\nWe introduce a mixture model, illustrated in Fig. 1, that\ncombines the advantages of standard softmax classi\ufb01ers\nwith those of a pointer component for effective and ef\ufb01-\ncient language modeling. Rather than relying on the RNN\nhidden state to decide when to use the pointer, as in the re-\ncent work of G \u00a8ulc \u00b8ehre et al. (2016), we allow the pointer\ncomponent itself to decide when to use the softmax vocab-\nulary through a sentinel. The model improves the state of\nthe art perplexity on the Penn Treebank. Since this com-\nmonly used dataset is small and no other freely available\nalternative exists that allows for learning long range depen-\ndencies, we also introduce a new benchmark dataset for\nlanguage modeling called WikiText.arXiv:1609.07843v1  [cs.CL]  26 Sep 2016Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Sentinelx\nRNN Distributionpvocab(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)pvocab(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)Pointer Distributionpptr(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)pptr(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)Output Distributionp(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)p(yN|w1,...,wN\u00001)\n SentinelQuery    RNN  Embed+\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7SoftmaxSoftmax\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Mixture gate gg\nFigure 2.

By integrating LLMs, we can create more adaptable systems that can quickly respond to changing production demands, thereby reducing downtime and operational costs. This research could pave the way for future studies on intelligent automation, leading to practical applications such as real-time production planning and user-friendly interfaces for non-expert users, ultimately transforming the landscape of industrial automation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of adapting LLMs to understand and generate contextually relevant responses for specific industrial tasks. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate nature of industrial processes, the need for precise control logic, and the requirement for LLMs to interpret domain-specific language accurately. Additionally, technical obstacles such as ensuring interoperability with existing systems and the need for high-quality, domain-specific datasets for fine-tuning present significant hurdles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has largely focused on general applications of LLMs, with limited exploration of their potential in industrial contexts. Barriers include a lack of structured frameworks for integrating LLMs into existing automation systems and insufficient datasets for training models on specific industrial tasks.

We will implement a proof-of-concept on a physical production system, using metrics such as task execution time and accuracy of generated production plans to evaluate performance. The expected outcomes include a functional LLM-controlled automation system capable of interpreting natural language user tasks, generating production plans, and executing operations on the shop floor, thereby demonstrating the practical applicability of LLMs in industrial settings.", "proposal_5q": ["[Question 1]: What is the problem?  \nThe specific research question I aim to address is: How can we develop an adaptive digital twin framework that integrates large language models with reinforcement learning to autonomously optimize industrial processes by generating and updating contextualized operational guidelines based on real-time production data?\n\n[Question 2]: Why is it interesting and important?  \nSolving this problem has significant implications for the research community and industrial applications. First, the integration of large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) represents a novel intersection of artificial intelligence methodologies that can lead to breakthroughs in process optimization. This research could pave the way for future studies on intelligent systems that learn and adapt in real-time, enhancing the understanding of human-AI collaboration in industrial settings. Moreover, by generating contextualized operational guidelines, the framework could improve operational efficiency and responsiveness in production environments, ultimately leading to cost reduction and increased competitiveness in the market. The practical applications of this research extend to various sectors, including manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management, where dynamic adaptability to market demands is crucial.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges in solving this problem are multifaceted. First, integrating LLMs with RL involves both technical and theoretical complexities, as these models operate on different principles\u2014LLMs excel in natural language understanding while RL focuses on learning optimal policies through trial-and-error. A naive approach that treats these components as separate entities may fail to leverage their synergies, resulting in suboptimal performance. Additionally, the variability and complexity of production data pose significant obstacles, as real-time data can be noisy and unstructured, complicating the learning process. Furthermore, developing a robust feedback mechanism that accurately captures operational performance and translates it into actionable guidelines requires sophisticated modeling and extensive validation, which can be resource-intensive.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has largely focused on either LLMs or RL in isolation, with limited exploration of their combined potential in industrial applications. The lack of integrated frameworks that can handle both the interpretative power of language models and the adaptive learning capabilities of reinforcement learning has created a significant gap. Moreover, existing solutions often fail to consider the dynamic nature of production environments and the need for real-time updates to operational guidelines. Barriers such as insufficient datasets for training hybrid models and a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and industrial engineering have further hindered progress. My approach aims to bridge these gaps by proposing a cohesive framework that simultaneously addresses the complexities of real-time data interpretation and autonomous decision-making.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves developing an adaptive digital twin framework that synergistically integrates LLMs with RL algorithms. The framework will utilize a robust dataset comprising historical and real-time production data, including operational metrics and human instructions. The LLM will be employed to extract insights and generate contextualized operational guidelines, while the RL component will adapt these guidelines based on continuous feedback from the production environment. Key metrics for evaluation will include operational efficiency, adaptability to changing conditions, and the reduction of manual interventions.

The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFollowing the emergence of ChatGPT\u00a0(OpenAI, 2022), enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs) has escalated globally.\nThe release of the Llama series\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023) has further ignited interests within the open-source community, particularly regarding GPT-level local LLMs.\nRecently, Claude-3 Opus\u00a0(Anthropic, 2024) and GPT-4o (omni)\u00a0(OpenAI, 2024), the updated model for ChatGPT, have ascended to the pinnacle of the Chatbot Arena\u00a0(Chiang et\u00a0al., 2024) in quick succession. This platform is well-regarded for its human evaluations of LLMs.\nMoreover, Llama-3\u00a0(AI@Meta, 2024) has emerged as the state-of-the-art open-weight model series, narrowing the performance gap with leading proprietary models and widely acknowledged as GPT-4\u2013level.\nAn increasing number of competitive LLMs are now pursuing advancements similar to those made by the GPT series from OpenAI.\nMany of these models, including Qwen\u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al., 2023a), Mistral\u00a0(Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023a),\nGemma\u00a0(Mesnard et\u00a0al., 2024), etc., have been released in an open-weight manner.\n\n\nOver recent months, we have successively introduced the Qwen series\u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al., 2023a) and progressed to Qwen1.5\u00a0(Qwen Team, 2024a).\nIn the meantime, we have unveiled the vision-language model Qwen-VL\u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al., 2023b), and launched the audio-language model Qwen-Audio\u00a0(Chu et\u00a0al., 2023).\nIn this work, we introduce the newest addition to the Qwen family of large language models and large multimodal modles: Qwen2.\nQwen2 is a series of LLMs, grounded in the Transformer architecture\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017), trained using next-token prediction.\nThe model series encompasses foundational, i.e., base language models, pre-trained but unaligned to human preferences, and instruction-tuned models, fine-tuned with single-turn and multi-turn instruction-following datasets suitable for chat and agent purposes.\nOur release comprises four dense models with parameter counts of 0.5 billion, 1.5 billion, 7 billion, and 72 billion, plus a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 57 billion parameters, of which 14 billion are activated for each token.\nThe smaller models, specifically Qwen2-0.5B and Qwen2-1.5B, are designed for easy deployment on portable devices such as smartphones, earphones, and smart glasses.\nConversely, the larger models cater to deployment across GPUs of varying scales.\n\n\nAll models were pre-trained on a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 7 trillion tokens, covering a wide range of domains and languages.\nCompared to previous editions of Qwen, Qwen2 includes a broader spectrum of linguistic data, enhancing the quantity and quality of code and mathematics content.\nThis enrichment is hypothesized to improve reasoning abilities of LLMs.\nRegarding post-training, all models underwent supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et\u00a0al., 2023), aligning them with human preferences through learning from human feedback.\nThis process endows the models with the capability to follow instructions effectively.\n\n\nWe have conducted a thorough evaluation of Qwen2, alongside a selection of baseline models including both open-weight and proprietary models accessible via API.\nQwen2 outperforms competing models in evaluations of both fundamental language capabilities and instruction-tuned functionalities\nSpecifically, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, our instruction-tuned variant, scores 9.1 on MT-Bench\u00a0(Zheng et\u00a0al., 2023), 48.1 on Arena-Hard\u00a0(Chiang et\u00a0al., 2024), and 35.7 on LiveCodeBench\u00a0(Jain et\u00a0al., 2024).\nMeanwhile, Qwen2-72B, the base language model, achieves 84.2 on MMLU\u00a0(Hendrycks et\u00a0al., 2021a), 37.9 on GPQA\u00a0(Rein et\u00a0al., 2023), 64.6 on HumanEval\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2021), 89.5 on GSM8K\u00a0(Cobbe et\u00a0al., 2021), and 82.4 on BBH\u00a0(Suzgun et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n \n\n2 Tokenizer & Model\n\nThis section introduces the tokenizer and model design of Qwen2.\nWe detail the model architecture and configurations for different model sizes.\n\n\n\n2.1 Tokenizer\n\nFollowing Qwen\u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al., 2023a), we employ the identical", " Introduction  \nAutomation system s vs. Autonomous systems  \nIn the evolving landscape of technology, the terms automation and autonomous systems are \noften intertwined yet distinctly different in impact. Both involve the use of technology to perform \ntasks with minimal or no human intervention , but differ significantly in their flexibility in decision -\nmaking : \n\u2022 Automation : Traditional automated systems generally follow rigid, predefined rules and \nworkflows and are not designed to adapt to changes unless those changes have been \nanticipated and programmed into the system. A usual pre-requisite  of automation lies in \nrepeatability  and predictability, which limits its adaptability to dynamic environments.  \u2022 Autonomy1: on the other hand, autonomy entails  a higher level of adaptability and \ndecision -making capability. An autonomous system can adapt to un -predefined  changes \nand utilize knowledge to make decisions based on available options and system \nobjectives , demonstrating flexibility in problem -solving and task execution , whereas \nautomation typically does not . This concept is commonly applied in fields such as \nintelligent robotics and  artificial intelligence , and  it is also used in political contexts to \ndescribe self -determined individuals or systems that make choices aiming to achieve \noptimal outcomes. [1] \nIn the transition from automation to autonomy, the key differentiator is intelligence \u2014the \ncapability to make informed, dynamic decisions.  This intelligence cannot be practically \nprovided by u sing exhaustive rules due to the unpredictability and variability of real -world \nenvironments. Such rules cannot cover every possible scenario  and often struggle with \ngranularity \u2014they can be either too broad, failing to address specific situations, or overly \ndetailed, making them cumbersome to exhaustively implement and maintain. Moreover , \nmaintaining and updating such a com prehensive rule set demands extensive engineering  \neffort. The  technological development in natural language understanding indicates  the \nsuperiority of machine learning with neural networks over  rule-based systems , as the top \nsolutions are all based on  neural networks  [2].  \nLarge language models (LLMs) can  offer the intelligence  to bridge the gap between traditional \nautomation and autonomy in industrial  systems. These models internalize the knowledge \npatterns learned from training data conveying collective human knowledge , and they are \ncapable of  interpreting complex text and performing dynamic reasoning  based on the given \ninput . Their  general  adaptability allows them to respond to new situations and conditions \nwithout the need for specific re -training . \nIncorporating LLMs into industrial automation systems empowers us to utilize their capabilities \nin performing  diverse  tasks within industrial automation , further reduc ing the need for human \nintervention in tasks that require intelligence. LLMs are particularly effective in extracting \nimportant information from vast datasets, comprehending texts, making reasoning, solving \nproblems, and supporting decision -making processes  [3]. By enabling these models to perform \nintelligent information process ing based on real -time data, they can swiftly adapt to changes, \nthereby boosting efficiency and productivity.  \nIn the following sections,  we explore the integration of LLMs", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\n\n\n\u201cAn autonomous agent is a system situated within and a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future.\u201d\n\n\nFranklin and Graesser (1997)\n\n\n\n\nAutonomous agents have long been recognized as a promising approach to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is expected to accomplish tasks through self-directed planning and actions.\nIn previous studies, the agents are assumed to act based on simple and heuristic policy functions, and learned in isolated and restricted environments\u00a0[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nSuch assumptions significantly differs from the human learning process, since the human mind is highly complex, and individuals can learn from a much wider variety of environments.\nBecause of these gaps, the agents obtained from the previous studies are usually far from replicating human-level decision processes, especially in unconstrained, open-domain settings.\n\n\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable successes, demonstrating significant potential in attaining human-like intelligence\u00a0[7, 6, 5, 8, 9, 10]. This capability arises from leveraging comprehensive training datasets alongside a substantial number of model parameters.\nBuilding upon this capability, there has been a growing research area that employs LLMs as central controllers to construct autonomous agents to obtain human-like decision-making capabilities\u00a0[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\n\n\nComparing with reinforcement learning, LLM-based agents have more comprehensive internal world knowledge, which facilitates more informed agent actions even without training on specific domain data.\nAdditionally, LLM-based agents can provide natural language interfaces to interact with humans, which is more flexible and explainable.\n\n\nAlong this direction, researchers have developed numerous promising models (see Figure\u00a01 for an overview of this field), where the key idea is to equip LLMs with crucial human capabilities like memory and planning to make them behave like humans and complete various tasks effectively.\nPreviously, these models were proposed independently, with limited efforts made to summarize and compare them holistically.\nHowever, we believe a systematic summary on this rapidly developing field is of great significance to comprehensively understand it and benefit to inspire future research.\n\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents.\nSpecifically, we organize our survey based on three aspects including the construction, application, and evaluation of LLM-based autonomous agents.\nFor the agent construction, we focus on two problems, that is,\n(1) how to design the agent architecture to better leverage LLMs,\nand (2) how to inspire and enhance the agent capability to complete different tasks.\nIntuitively, the first problem aims to build the hardware fundamentals for the agent, while the second problem focus on providing the agent with software resources.\nFor the first problem, we present a unified agent framework, which can encompass most of the previous studies.\nFor the second problem, we provide a summary on the commonly-used strategies for agents\u2019 capability acquisition.\nIn addition to discussing agent construction, we also provide an systematic overview of the applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in social science, natural science, and engineering.\nFinally, we delve into the strategies for evaluating LLM-based autonomous agents, focusing on both subjective and objective strategies.\n\n\nIn summary, this survey conducts a systematic review and establishes comprehensive", " INTRODUCTION  \nFlexible production has emerged as a significant  aspect of \nmodern manufacturing environments in response to changing \nmarket demands  and product customiz ation requirements. \nManufacturers need to  adapt quickly to market changes and to  \nstay competitive.  This leads  the manufacturer to  consider  \ndiversif ying their product s and provid ing customized \nmanufacturing services , which requires an agile production \nsystem  and efficient management of  the complexity  of the  \nproductio n.  \nHowever, there are several technical challenges for \ndeployment of agile and flexible  production in reality : First of \nall, flexible production requires  seamless integration  of \ndiverse technologies solu tion, e.g., robotics, automation, \nplanning algorithms et c. Secondly,  the production equipment \nand manufacturing  processes need to  be reconfigu rable  \n[1][2], which requires  modular processes  and systems  as well as reconfigurable machines . Furthermore,  automated flexible \nproduction also requires  quick changeover  [3] after decision -\nmaking  to adapt the production against the changing \nrequirements . Eventually , a highly  knowledgeable  \nworkforce  in every complicated technology  with high \navailability to manage and supervise  the complex  system  is \ntoo luxurious to be true . Traditional production systems \nfrequently face difficulties in fulfilling these requirements due \nto their inflexible  [1], dedicated workflows and restricted \nadaptability , as well as the absence of domain -specific \nknowledge in  reconfiguring the production facility .  \nTo tackle these challenges and requi rements, we propose a \nnovel solution: a large language model (LLM) enhanced \nautomated modular production system  for flexible \nmanufacturing .  \nOur messages and contributions from this paper are \nsummarized as follows:  \n(1) We demonstrate with a representative use case \nexplaining why and how large language models  can \nbe used to achieve a higher level of intelligence  and \nadaptability  of industrial automation systems  by \nplanning and controlling the production , especially in \nthe context of flexible  production scenarios.  \n(2) We structure the system design according to  the \nautomation pyramid , illustrating a feasible technical \napproach to integrate LLM s into automation system . \n(3) We prefer  the more scalable  in-context -learning \napproach over the fine-tuning approach , and t he task -\nspecific knowledge  is injected into a LLM in prompt.   \nAs prompt engineering  is an emerging field with little \nstandardization , we devise  a structured prompt \ntemplate for this use case, drawing on insights from \nexisting research in Natural Language Processing . \nII. BACKGROUND  \nIn this section, we start by discussing why and how  \nmodular production systems can meet the requirements  \nseamless integratio n and reconfigurability  for flexible \nproduction.

Last but not \nleast, we provide a", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2022; Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2022; Rae et\u00a0al., 2021; Dai et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; Raffel et\u00a0al., 2019; Shazeer and Stern, 2018; Ba et\u00a0al., 2016; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022a; Huang et\u00a0al., 2022; Kojima et\u00a0al., 2022; Kaplan et\u00a0al., 2020; Henighan et\u00a0al., 2020; Yang et\u00a0al., 2022; Shazeer et\u00a0al., 2017; Zoph et\u00a0al., 2022; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022b; Dehghani et\u00a0al., 2019; Su et\u00a0al., 2021; Alayrac et\u00a0al., ; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022a; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021; Black et\u00a0al., 2021; Scao et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Radford et\u00a0al., 2017; Lample and Conneau, 2019; Dao et\u00a0al., 2022; Child et\u00a0al., 2019; Rabe and Staats, 2021; Gray et\u00a0al., 2017).\n\n\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios.\nTo test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.\n\n\nOn a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark\u00a0(Hendrycks et\u00a0al., 2021a, b), an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections.\n\n\nThis report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.\n\n\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Radford et\u00a0al., 2019, 2018): it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from \u201challucinations\u201d), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.\n\n\nGPT-4\u2019s capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing", "ABSTRACT\nWhile large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance\nacross tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their\nabilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action\nplan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we\nexplore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speci\ufb01c actions\nin an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning\ntraces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle\nexceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information\nfrom external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our\napproach, named ReAct , to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks\nand demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to\nimproved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question\nanswering (HotpotQA) and fact veri\ufb01cation (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent\nissues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by\ninteracting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving\ntrajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.\nFurthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and\nWebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learningmethods degrade soon after \ufb01netuning.\nB.2 A LFWORLD IM-S TYLE DETAILS\nFor the IM-style ablation, the same expert trajectories used in ReAct are reannotated with dense\nexternal feedback thoughts within these trajectories, that limit ReAct-IM to only think about (1)\ndecomposing the current goal and (2) the current subgoal that needs to be completed. In particular,\nReAct-IM lacks thoughts that (1) determine when a subgoal is completed (2) determine what the\nnext subgoal should be (3) inducing the LLM to refer to its internal pretraining knowledge to identify\nwhere items can be within the environment.\n15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nC P ROMPTS\nC.1 H OTPOT QA\nHotpot QA Prompts\nOrig inal\nQuestion What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the\nColorado orogeny extends into?\nAnswer 1,800 to 7,000 ft\nQuestion Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\"\ncharacter Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nAnswer Richard Nixon\nQuestion Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The\nSaimaa Gesture?\nAnswer The Saimaa Gesture\nQuestion What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nAnswer director, screenwriter, actor\nQuestion Which magazine was started first Arthur\u2019s Magazine or First for Women?\nAnswer Arthur\u2019s Magazine\nQuestion Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nAnswer Yes\nAct\nQuestion What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the\nColorado orogeny extends into?\nAction 1 Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1 The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in\nColorado and surrounding areas.\nAction 2 Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2 (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called\nthe Central Plains orogeny.\nAction 3 Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3 High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nAction 4 Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4 The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains.

As\nwe pre-train larger models, full \ufb01ne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example \u2013 deploying indepen-\ndent instances of \ufb01ne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B \ufb01ne-tuned with Adam,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than \ufb01ne-\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\nno additional inference latency .

By enhancing LLMs' ability to reason with graphs, we can unlock their potential for more complex tasks, leading to improved performance in various fields, including natural language processing, game design, and automated reasoning. This research could pave the way for more robust AI systems that can handle structured data effectively, ultimately contributing to the development of Artificial General Intelligence.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in this problem stem from the inherent ambiguity and complexity of natural language instructions, which can lead to misinterpretation by LLMs. Naive approaches that rely solely on natural language prompts may fail to provide the necessary clarity for the models to perform accurately, resulting in incorrect or incomplete answers. Additionally, the intricacies of graph algorithms themselves pose a theoretical challenge, as they often require multi-step reasoning and a clear understanding of relationships between entities. Overcoming these obstacles necessitates a careful balance in prompt design to avoid overwhelming the model while ensuring sufficient detail for accurate reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on the capabilities of LLMs in processing natural language without adequately addressing the specific needs of graph reasoning tasks. Existing studies have shown mixed results regarding LLMs' performance on graph problems, indicating a gap in understanding how to effectively prompt these models for such tasks. Barriers include a lack of targeted methodologies for integrating structured prompts like pseudo-code and insufficient exploration of how different prompting strategies impact model performance. Our approach differs by specifically investigating the use of pseudo-code instructions, which has not been thoroughly explored in the context of graph reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves designing a series of experiments where LLMs are prompted with pseudo-code instructions to solve various graph algorithm problems.

By creating a sophisticated chatbot that tailors recipes to individual preferences and dietary needs, we can enhance user engagement in cooking and promote healthier eating habits. This research could lead to advancements in personalized nutrition, where technology assists individuals in making informed dietary choices, thereby reducing health risks associated with poor nutrition.

First, creating accurate and meaningful relationships between ingredients, cooking techniques, and nutritional values requires sophisticated modeling of complex data, which is inherently difficult due to the vast variability in culinary practices and personal taste preferences. Naive approaches may fail to capture the intricate dependencies and flavor profiles essential for recipe creation, leading to bland or unsuitable suggestions. Additionally, ensuring that the chatbot can effectively engage in natural language interactions while maintaining the contextual relevance of culinary advice presents technical and theoretical obstacles. Implementing GNNs and GANs adds layers of complexity, as their integration demands expertise in both graph theory and generative modeling techniques.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has often focused on isolated aspects of recipe generation, such as ingredient substitution or basic recipe suggestion without considering the dynamic interplay between ingredients, techniques, and user preferences. Existing solutions have lacked the comprehensive approach that combines LLMs, GNNs, and GANs to create personalized and culturally relevant recipes. Barriers such as limited datasets that encompass diverse culinary traditions and the absence of robust models that capture flavor profiles have hindered progress. Our approach differs by employing a unified framework that leverages advanced neural network architectures to address these limitations, allowing for a more holistic and interactive culinary experience.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology involves developing a multi-layered architecture that integrates LLMs for natural language processing, GNNs for modeling ingredient relationships, and GANs for generating creative recipes.

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model\u2019s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies. To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data. By incorporating the text understanding", " INTRODUCTION\nGraphs, as a general data structure containing nodes and edges, are\nubiquitous in various real-world scenarios such as molecular graphs\nin chemistry [ 13,18] and social networks [ 24]. In the real world, the\ntext-attributed graph (TAG) is also representative, which integrates\nboth graph topological structure and text, enabling them to contain\nricher semantics. To effectively learn graph-structured data, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) have emerged. They introduce a message-\npassing mechanism to aggregate features from neighboring nodes,\nallowing the simultaneous incorporation of graph topology and\nnode features [8, 28].\nNote that GNNs only accept numerical features, whereas the\nattributes of nodes in TAGs are always in text format. Therefore,\nit is necessary to convert the textual attributes of nodes into em-\nbeddings that can be directly input into GNNs. In the classic GNN\npipeline, the text attributes of nodes are usually encoded as shallow\nembeddings, such as by FastText [ 14] and Word2Vec [ 23]. However,\nrecent studies argue that shallow embeddings have several limi-\ntations, such as the inability to effectively capture sentence-level\nsemantics [ 22] and inadequacy in handling the phenomenon of\npolysemy [ 27]. To overcome them, recent works have introduced\ntext encoding methods into the process of GNN\ntraining. The experimental Abstract :\nProbability theory represents and manipulates uncertainties, but\ncannot tell us how to behave.

The emergence of potent\nmodels such as ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al. 2023) has led to substantial influences on many\nareas like society, commerce, and research. However, LLMs\nstill suffer from severe factual hallucination problems, i.e.,\nLLMs can frequently generate unsupported false statements\nregarding factual information due to their lack of intrinsic\nknowledge (Ji et al. 2023). For example, in Figure 1, Chat-\nGPT fails to provide an accurate response to the query \u201c When\nis Fr\u00b4ed\u00b4eric Chopin\u2019s father\u2019s birthday? \u201d due to a wrong belief\nthat Nicolas Chopin\u2019s birthday is on June 17, 1771. Factual\nhallucination poses a severe challenge for LLM applications,\nparticularly in real-world situations where factual accuracy\nholds significance. Consequently, the endeavor to alleviate\nfactual hallucinations in LLMs has become a research hotspot\nin NLP field (Liu et al. 2021; Kang and Hashimoto 2020).\n*These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright \u00a92024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.On the other hand, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store a sub-\nstantial amount of high-quality factual information, which\ncan significantly alleviate factual hallucination if incorpo-\nrated with LLMs. For example, in Figure 1, we can retrofit\nthe erroneous statement \u201c Nicolas Chopin was born on June\n17, 1771 \u201d by referring to the provided factual knowledge\n\u201c(Nicolas Chopin, date of birth, 1771-04-15T00:00:0) \u201d in\nWikidata. Recent work has focused on integrating LLMs\nwith KGs by retrieving the entities in the query within knowl-\nedge graphs. Then the obtained factual triples are utilized\nas an additional context for LLMs to enhance their factual\nknowledge (Baek, Aji, and Saffari 2023; Chase 2022). Un-\nfortunately, these approaches are limited to retrieving factual\nknowledge relevant to entities explicitly mentioned within\nthe given query. However, the fundamental capability of large\nlanguage models involves intricate and multi-step reasoning.\nSuch reasoning processes often necessitate the validation and\naugmentation of factual knowledge that may be employed\nduring the reasoning process. For example, in the case shown\nin Figure 1, LLM fails to answer the question because it\nrequires an intermediate knowledge about \u201c Nicolas Chopin\nwas born on April 15, 1771 \u201d. However, such information\ndoes not refer to entities appearing in the query. As a result,\nprevious approaches are inadequate in addressing the factual\nhallucination appearing in the reasoning processes of LLMs.\nIn this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph-based\nRetrofitting (KGR), a new framework that incorporates LLMs\nwith KGs to mitigate factual hallucination during the entire\nreasoning process of LLMs. Instead of retrieving factual in-\nformation from KGs using original queries, the main idea\nbehind KGR is to autonomously retrofit the initial draft re-\nsponses of LLMs based on the factual knowledge stored in\nKGs. However, achieving the above process is challenging\nbecause draft responses generated by large language mod-\nels typically contain a mixture of various information about\nthe reasoning process, making the extraction, verification,\nand revision of relevant knowledge in it very challenging.\nTherefore, the key to integrating Knowledge Graphs into the\nreasoning process of large models to mitigate factual halluci-\nnations lies in efficiently extracting the information requiring\nvalidation from draft responses, querying and selecting rele-\nvant knowledge from the knowledge graphs, and using thisarXiv:2311.13314v1  [cs.CL]  22 Nov 2023Claim \nExtractionEntity\nDetectionFact\nSelectionClaim\nVerificationResponse\nRetrofitting\nRetrofitted response\nFr\u00e9 d\u00e9 ric Chopin's father is\nNicolas Chopin, hewas born\nonApril 15,1771 .\nClaim 1 .

In recent literature, a few preliminary stud-\nies [44, 7, 40, 13] have made attempts to uncover the potentia l of LLMs in handling graph-structured\ndata. Unfortunately, a comprehensive examination of LLMs\u2019 capacity to extract and harness cru-\ncial topological structures across diverse prompt setting s, task levels, and datasets remains underex-\nplored.

In addition, Ye et al.[44] \ufb01ne-tuned LLMs on a designated dataset\nto outperform GNN, underscoring a distinct research object ive compared", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown great performance in many NLP tasks (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Bang et\u00a0al., 2023). What\u2019s especially striking is their ability to handle complex tasks through reasoning (Wei et\u00a0al., 2022; Huang & Chang, 2023). To further unleash LLMs\u2019 reasoning ability, the plan-and-solve paradigm (Wang et\u00a0al., 2023c) has been proposed, in which LLMs are prompted to generate a plan and execute each reasoning step. In this way, LLMs decompose complex reasoning tasks into a series of sub-tasks and solve them step by step (Khot et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nDespite their success, LLMs are still limited by the lack of knowledge and prone to hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to errors in reasoning processes (Hong et\u00a0al., 2023; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023b). For example, as shown in Figure\u00a01, LLMs do not have the latest knowledge and hallucinate an incorrect reasoning step: \u201chas a daughter\u201d. These issues largely diminish the performance and trustworthiness of LLMs in high-stakes scenarios, such as legal judgment and medical diagnosis.\n\n\nTo tackle the issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been incorporated to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs (Pan et\u00a0al., 2024; Luo et\u00a0al., 2023a). KGs capture abundant factual knowledge in a structured format, which provides a faithful knowledge source for reasoning. As a typical reasoning task, knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to obtain answers based on knowledge from KGs (Sun et\u00a0al., 2019). Previous works that jointly use KGs and LLMs for KGQA reasoning can be broadly divided into two categories: 1) semantic parsing methods (Lan & Jiang, 2020; Ye et\u00a0al., 2022), which use LLMs to convert questions into logical queries that are executed on KGs to obtain answers; and 2) retrieval-augmented methods (Li et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023), which retrieve triples from KGs as knowledge context and uses LLMs to obtain the final answers.\n\n\nAlthough semantic parsing methods can generate more accurate and interpretable results by leveraging reasoning on KGs, the generated logical queries can often be non-executable and yield no answers, due to syntax and semantic limitations (Yu et\u00a0al., 2022a). Retrieval-augmented methods are more flexible and exploit the ability of LLMs for reasoning. However, they only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning (Jiang et\u00a0al., 2022). For instance, as shown in Figure\u00a01, a relation path, which is a sequence of relations, \u201cchild_of\u2192normal-\u2192\\to\u2192has_son\u201d can be used to obtain answers to the question \u201cWho is the brother of Justin Bieber?\u201d. Therefore, it is essential to enable LLMs to directly reason on KGs to achieve faithful and interpretable reasoning.\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs with KGs to conduct faithful and interpretable reasoning. To alleviate the issues of hallucinations and lack of knowledge, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans via the planning module. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from KGs to conduct faithful reasoning by the retrieval-reasoning module. In this way, we not only retrieve the latest knowledge from KGs but also consider the guidance of KG structure for", "ABSTRACT\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have gained the ability to assimilate human\nknowledge and facilitate natural language interactions with both humans and other\nLLMs. However, despite their impressive achievements, LLMs have not made\nsignificant advancements in the realm of graph machine learning. This limitation\narises because graphs encapsulate distinct relational data, making it challenging\nto transform them into natural language that LLMs understand. In this paper,\nwe bridge this gap with a novel framework, G RAPH TEXT, that translates graphs\nto natural language. G RAPH TEXT derives a graph-syntax tree for each graph that\nencapsulates both the node attributes and inter-node relationships. Traversal of the\ntree yields a graph text sequence, which is then processed by an LLM to treat graph\ntasks as text generation tasks. Notably, G RAPH TEXT offers multiple advantages.\nIt introduces training-free graph reasoning : even without training on graph data,\nGRAPH TEXT with ChatGPT can achieve on par with, or even surpassing, the per-\nformance of supervised-trained graph neural networks through in-context learning\n(ICL). Furthermore, G RAPH TEXT paves the way for interactive graph reasoning ,\nallowing both humans and LLMs to communicate with the model seamlessly us-\ning natural language. These capabilities underscore the vast, yet-to-be-explored\npotential of LLMs in the domain of graph machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nLanguage stands as a cornerstone of human civilization, acting as the primary medium for knowl-\nedge encoding, reasoning, and communication. Large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on\nextensive text corpora, have showcased remarkable reasoning skills (Brown et al., 2020; Bubeck\net al., 2023). These LLMs can communicate via natural language both internally (Wei et al., 2022)\nand externally with humans or other LLMs (Li et al., 2023), demonstrating exceptional skills such\nas multi-step reasoning (Yao et al., 2023a), decision-making (Yao et al., 2023b; Liang et al., 2023),\ntool use (Schick et al., 2023), and multi-agent collaboration (Park et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023).\nMotivation. Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in handling natural languages, their appli-\ncation to other data modalities presents unique challenges, primarily because these data often lack\nstraightforward transformation into sequential text. These challenges are especially severe when\ndealing with graph-structured data, as different graphs define structure and features in distinct ways.\nTherefore, existing efforts within the graph machine learning field commonly require the training of\nspecific graph neural networks (GNNs) tailored to individual graphs (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Velick-\novic et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Often, models trained on one graph cannot generalize to the\nunseen structure and feature representations of other graphs. Moreover, the gap between graphs and\nhuman languages hinders the application of natural language reasoning to facilitate graph reasoning.\nIn light of these limitations, a question arises: can we derive a language for graph in natural lan-\nguage? In this paper, we give an affirmative answer by proposing to use treeas an intermediary,\nelegantly bridging structured data and one-dimensional sequential language. Essentially, a tree ex-\nhibits a hierarchical structure, and traversing it yields a one-dimensional sequence. On top of that,\nas shown in Figure 1 (c), we propose a novel framework G RAPH TEXT, which takes graph data to\nbuild a graph-syntax tree. Traversing itresults in Table 4.1,\naccompanied by the explanations of reasoning above, indicates that a deep-seated bias - where the\ncentral node is viewed as the most vital", " introduction\n(Sec. 1).

Detailed discussion can be found in Appendix A.\n\n\nDespite their success in many applications, LLMs have been criticized for their lack of factual knowledge. Specifically, LLMs memorize facts and knowledge contained in the training corpus [14]. However, further studies reveal that LLMs are not able to recall facts and often experience hallucinations by generating statements that are factually incorrect [28, 15]. For example, LLMs might say \u201cEinstein discovered gravity in 1687\u201d when asked, \u201cWhen did Einstein discover gravity?\u201d, which contradicts the fact that Isaac Newton formulated the gravitational theory. This issue severely impairs the trustworthiness of LLMs.\n\n\nAs black-box models, LLMs are also criticized for their lack of interpretability. LLMs represent knowledge implicitly in their parameters. It is difficult to interpret or validate the knowledge obtained by LLMs. Moreover, LLMs perform reasoning by a probability model, which is an indecisive process [16]. The specific patterns and functions LLMs used to arrive at predictions or decisions are not directly accessible or explainable to humans [17]. Even though some LLMs are equipped to explain their predictions by applying chain-of-thought [29], their reasoning explanations also suffer from the hallucination issue [30]. This severely impairs the application of LLMs in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical diagnosis and legal judgment. For instance, in a medical diagnosis scenario, LLMs may incorrectly diagnose a disease and provide explanations that contradict medical commonsense. This raises another issue that LLMs trained on general corpus might not be able to generalize well to specific domains or new knowledge due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge or new training data [18].\n\n\nTo address the above issues, a potential solution is to incorporate knowledge graphs (KGs) into LLMs. Knowledge graphs (KGs), storing enormous facts in the way of triples, i.e., (h\u2062e\u2062a\u2062d\u2062e\u2062n\u2062t\u2062i\u2062t\u2062y,r\u2062e\u2062l\u2062a\u2062t\u2062i\u2062o\u2062n,t\u2062a\u2062i\u2062l\u2062e\u2062n\u2062t\u2062i\u2062t\u2062y)\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66(head~{}entity,relation,tail~{}entity)( italic_h italic_e italic_a italic_d italic_e italic_n italic_t italic_i italic_t italic_y , italic_r italic_e italic_l italic_a italic_t italic_i italic_o italic_n , italic_t italic_a italic_i italic_l italic_e italic_n italic_t italic_i italic_t italic_y ), are a structured and decisive manner of knowledge representation (e.g., Wikidata [20], YAGO [31], and NELL [32]).

These tasks range from answering questions to performing semantic analysis and identifying named entities\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2023). Despite the considerable strides that have been made, the capacity of LLMs to decipher and manage structured knowledge, especially in the form of graph-structured data, remains an area ripe for exploration. Understanding graph-structured data is vital, given its pervasive presence and integral role in a multitude of applications such as social network analysis, drug discovery, recommender systems, and spatio-temporal prediction. Understanding graph data is crucial for AGI.\n\n\nTasks based on graph data can be broadly classified into two categories based on their goals. The first category includes structure understanding tasks like identifying significant nodes, calculating centrality metrics\u00a0Okamoto et\u00a0al. (2008); Zhang and Luo (2017); Brandes (2001); Barthelemy (2004); Newman (2005), and determining diameters\u00a0Chung et\u00a0al. (1994). The second category encompasses semantic understanding tasks, such as knowledge graph question answering\u00a0(can be abstracted as knowledge graph )\u00a0Huang et\u00a0al. (2019); Zhang et\u00a0al. (2018), node classification\u00a0Bhagat et\u00a0al. (2011); Rong et\u00a0al. (2019) and graph classification\u00a0Errica et\u00a0al. (2019), etc. These tasks have distinct requirements and challenges.\n\n\nPrevious researches have investigated the use of LLMs for structural understanding\u00a0Sui et\u00a0al. (2023); Jiang et\u00a0al. (2023); Gong et\u00a0al. (2020); Liu et\u00a0al. (2022), but the emphasis has been predominantly on tables, which rely heavily on structured tabular data. Graphs, on the other hand, introduce additional dimensions of complexity. Comprised of nodes that represent entities or concepts, and edges that express relationships between these entities, graphs necessitate a more sophisticated level of comprehension from LLMs. Understanding graph structued data with LLM remains challenges. First of all, graph data can not be directly handled by LLM, as graph data are unorganized and complex. Secondly, there is a wide range of graph-related tasks, designing efficient input format for different tasks and effective prompt techniques is essential while rarely explored.\n\n\nIn this paper, our goal is to setup a comprehensive comparison to show the ability of LLM in understanding graph structured data. To achieve this goal, we first bridge the existing gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a novel framework that integrates LLMs and graph-structured data, intending to enhance their synergistic ability across a wide range of graph mining tasks. Based on the framework, we establish a benchmark across ten common scenarios to assess language models\u2019 capability in handling graph-related tasks. In addition, we experiment with various prompting methods, including both handcrafted and self-generated prompts, to demonstrate their effectiveness in boosting performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our findings reveal that while LLMs have demonstrated some capability in handling graph-structured data, there remains a substantial need for further development to achieve a performance level comparable to specialized graph-oriented models. In summary, our contribution can be summarized by:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe introduce a new framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and graph-structured data. This setup uses the language understanding skills of LLMs and graph description language with promt engineering to improve how they work together in different situations.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe develope a wide-ranging set of tasks, across ten common scenarios, to", " Introduction\nPrompting with natural language instructions has\nrecently emerged as a popular method of harness-\ning the capabilities of large language models.

In ad-\ndition, inference-time prompting strategies that\nspecifically aid multi-step reasoning have also been\nfound to be helpful \u2013 e.g: the inclusion of chain-\nof-thought reasoning in few-shot settings resultsarXiv:2305.11790v3  [cs.CL]  19 Oct 2023in improved performance over standard prompts\n(Wei et al., 2022b), the infamous \u201c Let\u2019s think step-\nby-step\u201d -prompt for boosting 0-shot performance\n(Kojima et al., 2022).\nAlgorithm 1 Attention Block\n1:function TRANSFORMERS _ATTENTION _BLOCK (Q,K,V)\n2: Input: Q,K, andV: input matrices.\n3: Output: The output of the attention block.\n4: scores \u2190Q\u00b7KT\n5: attention _weights \u2190softmax (scores )\n6: weighted _values \u2190attention _weights \u00b7V\n7: output \u2190Pn\ni=1weighted _values i\n8: return output\n9:end function\nGiven the inherent ambiguity present in natural\nlanguage, it is intuitive to consider the advantages\nof prompting with less ambiguous prompt styles,\nsuch as the use of pseudo-code. Pseudo-code is an\ninformal set of code-like constructs, which tend to\nbe easy to interpret for humans but are not neces-\nsarily compilable/executable. They are often used\nto express complex ideas, processes, and flows \u2013\nfor example, Algorithm 1 expresses a summarized\nversion of what happens within a Multi-Head At-\ntention block (Vaswani et al., 2017) in pseudo-code.\nArguably, expressing the same ideas in natural lan-\nguage could result in ambiguity and would perhaps\nrequire detailed text for clarity, which adds to the\ncomplexity.\nIn light of recent successes in NLP tasks\nachieved by code models (Madaan et al., 2022;\nZhang et al., 2023a,b), this study aims to exam-\nine the efficacy of using pseudo-code instructions\nfor prompting as a means of enhancing model per-\nformance. This study is driven by the hypothesis\nthat using pseudo-code as prompts could offer a\nnatural advantage to models in NLP tasks, owing\nto the concise and clearer expression of ideas in\npseudo-code. To test the hypothesis that prompt-\ning large language models with pseudo-code in-\nstead of natural language data could be helpful,\nwe created pseudo-code prompts2for132different\ntasks spanning 28 distinct task types, sourced from\nthe Super-NaturalInstructions dataset (Wang et al.,\n2022b) (see Listing 1 for an example). Using these\nprompts along with", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nOriginally designed for textual data, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for tasks beyond language processing. In robotics and planning, LLMs are adopted to guide agents through structured environments (Huang et\u00a0al., 2022; Andreas, 2022). In theory-of-mind reasoning, LLMs are required to maintain and update local and global graphs that reflect the beliefs of different characters (Adhikari et\u00a0al., 2020; Ammanabrolu and Riedl, 2021). In structured commonsense reasoning, LLMs are expected to generate graph-based action plans to achieve objectives with diversified prerequisites (Tandon et\u00a0al., 2019; Madaan et\u00a0al., 2022). In multi-hop question answering, LLMs implicitly find connections and paths among a vast network of entities and concepts (Creswell et\u00a0al., 2023). Together these works demonstrate that LLMs are widely adopted for tasks with implicit graphical structures while achieving preliminary success. However, one underlying yet crucial question remains underexplored: Can LLMs reason with graphs? More concretely, are LLMs capable of mapping textual descriptions of graphs and structures to grounded conceptual spaces and solving graph algorithm problems explicitly with natural language? The answer to this question has profound implications for large language model applications with implicit graphs and structures, the reasoning ability of LLMs in advanced and graph-based settings, and more.\n\n\nTo this end, we propose the Natural Language Graph (NLGraph) benchmark, a comprehensive testbed of graph and structured reasoning designed for language models and in natural language. NLGraph contains a total of 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from intuitively simple tasks such as connectivity, cycle, and shortest path to more complex problems such as topological sort, maximum flow, bipartite graph matching, Hamilton path, and simulating graph neural networks. We control for problem difficulty through generated graph size, network sparsity, numeric range, and more, presenting easy, medium, and hard subsets in each distinct graph reasoning task to enable fine-grained analysis. In addition to using exact match accuracy as a standard metric, we also design several partial credit solutions for various graph reasoning tasks.\n\n\nWith the NLGraph benchmark, we evaluate whether various large language models (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bubeck et\u00a0al., 2023) could perform graph-based reasoning and whether different prompting techniques (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022; Kojima et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2023; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023) improve the graph reasoning abilities of large language models. Extensive experiments on the NLGraph benchmark demonstrate that:\n\n\n1.\n\nLLMs do possess preliminary graph reasoning abilities. Specifically, large language models demonstrate an impressive level of performance that is 37.33% to 57.82% above the random baseline on simple graph reasoning tasks such as connectivity, cycle, and shortest path. With chain-of-thought prompting, LLMs could generate intermediate steps that are sound and accurate while further improving task performance.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\nThe benefit of advanced prompting methods diminishes with complex problems. On one hand, chain-of-thought (Wei et\u00a0al., 2022), least-to-most (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2023), and self-consistency (Wang et\u00a0al., 2023) successfully enhance the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs on simple tasks such as cycle and shortest path. On the other hand, these approaches are mostly ineffective, even counterproductive in certain settings, on more complex graph reasoning problems such as topological sort and Hamilton path.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\nLearning from examples did not", " Introduction (see footnote 1 for example), our Discussion: It was mentioned earlier that the answers generated by GPT-4 were long. Judge GPT-4 often\nrationalizes this length as (a) providing more detailed information, or (b) providing plausible alternatives.\nHowever, the answers created by GPT-3 are relatively shorter and Judge GPT-4 downweights this. Addition-\nally, the instructions for Judge GPT-4 explicitly state that one of the options must be picked , which further\npushes the model to make certain spurious decisions. It is surprising to note that despite this, the model\noccasionally states that neither answer is correct; this was a rare occurrence. When the human experts were\nquestioned about their rationale, they indicated that they veri\fed if the claim was present in either model-\ngenerated answer (regardless of the length) and picked the option that met this criteria. If no option met this\ncriteria, they picked neither8. Ensuring that models are calibrated like humans for this task requires more\nnuanced (and informative) instructions (through the prompts). Note, however, that the human is also able\nto create categories outside the ontology provided to GPT-4 (behavior that is unfaithful to the instructions).\nIf the human annotator was not allowed to pick \\neither\" or \\none\", then the re-calibrated scores will match\nwhat Judge GPT-4 chooses (the row \\ Human (constrained) \" in Table 6).\n8We do note that the humans performing this task could be biased based on their own experiences and were not checked for\ninter-rater agreement; the \fndings may change factoring these considerations as well.\n758 Limitations of autoregressive architecture highlighted by GPT-4\nAs witnessed in the previous sections, GPT-4 demonstrates impressive capabilities in a wide range of tasks,\nsuch as reasoning, content generation, problem solving, and more. However, as we will show in this section,\nthe model also has several substantial \raws, some of which seem to be inherent to the next-word prediction\nparadigm that underlies its architecture. We will illustrate these \raws with a series of examples and discuss\ntheir implications.\n8.1 Warm-up with two basic examples\nPredicting the next word is a task that relies on working memory and often requires planning ahead. Consider\nthe following example:\nGPT-4\nMerge the content of the next sentences into one sentence.\nThe Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs\nabove 4.5 percent, from near zero. That initially seemed to be slowing consumer and business demand and\nhelping inflation to moderate. But a number of recent economic reports have suggested that inflation did\nnot weaken as much as expected last year and remained faster than expected in January, while other data\nshowed hiring remains strong and consumer spending picked up at the start of the year.a\nMerged sentence:\nDespiteraisinginterestratesatthefastest pacesincethe1980s,fromnearzerotoabove4.5per\ncent,whichinitiallyappearedtoslowconsumerandbusinessdemandandmoderateinflation,theFed\nfacedanumberofrecenteconomicreportsthatindicatedinflationdidnotweakenasmuchasexpected\nlastyearandremainedfasterthanexpectedinJanuary,whilehiringremainedstrongandconsumerspend\ningpickedupatthestartoftheyear.\naThis text is taken from the New York Times, March 7th 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/\nbusiness/economy/fed-powell-interest-rates.html\nArguably, the average human would not be able to produce such a concise sentence without taking the\ntime to plan its structure and would likely have to \\backtrack\" (making edits) a few times before reaching the\n\fnal form. Yet the GPT architecture does not allow for such backtracking, which means that producing this\noutput required \\far-ahead\" planning. Due to the forward nature of GPT-4's output production, the only\nway for the model to do such far-ahead planning is to rely", " Introduction\nNumerical reasoning is a long-standing task in artificial intelligence. A surge of datasets has been proposed\nrecently to benchmark deep-learning models\u2019 capabilities to perform numerical/arithmetic reasoning. Some\nwidely used benchmarks are based on Math word problems (MWP) (Cobbe et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021;\nLu et al., 2022; Ling et al., 2017), where systems are supposed to answer math questions expressed with\nnatural text. Besides MWP, some datasets also consider financial problems (Chen et al., 2021b; 2022; Zhu\net al., 2021), where systems need to answer math-driven financial questions.\nPrior work (Ling et al., 2017; Cobbe et al., 2021) has studied how to train models from scratch or fine-tune\nmodels to generate intermediate steps to derive the final answer. Such methods can work efficiently on numerical reasoning tasks\nlike math or finance problem solving. We also study how to combine PoT with CoT to combine the merits of\nbothpromptingapproaches. We believePoTis suitableforproblems whichrequirehighly symbolic reasoning\nskills. For semantic reasoning tasks like commonsense reasoning (StrategyQA), we conjecture that PoT is\nnot the best option. In contrast, CoT can solve more broader reasoning tasks.\n6 results.\nAmong the 198 failure cases of numerical reasoning questions with the PoT (greedy) method, 47% have value\ngrounding errors and 33% have logic errors. In 15% both types of errors occurred and in 5% we believe the\nanswer is actually correct. We found that the majority of the errors are value grounding errors, which is also\ncommon for other Experiments\n3.1 Experimental Setup\nDatasets We summarize our evaluated datasets in Table 1.

It is because the fully-attentional structure of Transformer is general\nand powerful enough to take, process, and relate inputs and outputs of arbitrary structures, eliminating\na need for data- and task-speci\ufb01c inductive bias to be baked into the network architecture. Combined\nwith large-scale training, it opens up a new chapter for building a versatile model that can solve a wide\nrange of problems involving diverse data modalities and even a mixture of modalities [31, 30, 57].\nIn graph learning domain, inspired by the breakthroughs, multiple works tried combining self-\nattention into graph neural network (GNN) architecture where message passing was previously\ndominant [ 50]. As global self-attention across nodes cannot re\ufb02ect the graph structure, however, these methods such as graph Transformers that rely on dense attention bias.\nDataset We use transductive node classi\ufb01cation datasets, where each data is represented as a node in\na large-scale graph, including co-authorship (CS, Physics) [ 61], co-purchase (Photo, Computers) [ 61],\nand Wikipedia page networks (Chameleon, Crocodile) [ 59]. We randomly split the dataset into train,\nvalidation, and test sets by randomly reserving 30 random nodes per class for validation and test\nrespectively, and use the rest of the nodes for training. Dataset statistics is provided in Table 4.\n26Approach We utilize simple variants of TokenGT with Performer kernel attention of O(n+m)\ncomplexity. Due to the large number of nodes n, an immediate challenge for TokenGT is dealing\nwith the orthonormality assumption on the node identi\ufb01ers (Lemma 1) as the maximal number of\northonormal node identi\ufb01ers is bounded by dimension dp. In this case, it is reasonable to introduce\nnear-orthonormal vectors as node identi\ufb01ers, as it is theoretically guaranteed that we can draw\nan exponential number O(e\n(dp))ofdp-dimensional near-orthonormal vectors [ 22]. For TokenGT\n(Near-ORF) , we usedp= 64 -dimensional random node identi\ufb01ers where each entry is sampled\nfromf\u00001=dp;+1=dpgwith coin toss [ 22]. For TokenGT (Lap) , we use a subset of the Laplacian\neigenvectors as node identi\ufb01ers, speci\ufb01cally dp=2eigenvectors with lowest eigenvalues and dp=2\neigenvectors with highest eigenvalues, and choose dpamong 64-100based on validation performance.\nWhile Near-ORF andLap can theoretically serve as an ef\ufb01cient low-rank approximation for or-\nthonormal node identi\ufb01ers, their approximation can affect the quality of modeled equivariant basis\n(Section 3). In particular, equivariant basis ( \u0016) represented as sparse basis tensor ( B\u0016; De\ufb01nition 4)\nare expected to be affected more, as they require most entries to be zero. To remedy this, we take a\nsimple approach of residually adding one of such sparse equivariant operators Xii7!Xii+P\nj6=iXij\nexplicitly after each Transformer layer. We denote this variant as TokenGT (Lap) + Performer + SEB ,\nwhere SEB abbreviates sparse equivariant basis. This \ufb01x is minimal, easy to implement, and highly\nef\ufb01cient as it only requires a single torch.coalesce() call, and also empirically effective.\nArchitecture All our models in Table 5 utilize a linear prediction head on the node tokens obtained\nat the \ufb01nal Transformer layer to perform node-level classi\ufb01cation.

Compared to\nthese approaches, self-consistency is far simpler and requires no additional training. The approach\nwe propose simply couples the generation of reasoning paths and a \ufb01nal answer by sampling from\nthe decoder, using aggregation to recover the most consistent answer without additional modules.\nConsistency in language models. Some prior work has shown that language models can suffer\nfrom inconsistency in conversation (Adiwardana et al., 2020), explanation generation (Camburu et al.,\n2020), and factual knowledge extraction (Elazar et al., 2021). Welleck et al. (2020) use \u201cconsistency\u201d\nto refer to generating an in\ufb01nite-length sequence in recurrent language models. Nye et al. (2021)\nimprove the logical consistency of samples from a System 1 model by adding a System 2-inspired\nlogical reasoning module. In this paper we focus on a slightly different notion of \u201cconsistency\u201d, i.e.,\nutilizing answer consistency among diverse reasoning paths to improve accuracy.\n5 C ONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nWe introduced a simple yet effective method called self-consistency, and observed that it signi\ufb01cantly\nimproves accuracy in a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, across four large\nlanguage models with varying scales. Beyond accuracy gains, self-consistency is also useful for\ncollecting rationales when performing reasoning tasks with language models, and for providing\nuncertainty estimates and improved calibration of language model outputs.\nOne limitation of self-consistency is that it incurs more computation cost. In practice people can try a\nsmall number of paths (e.g., 5 or 10) as a starting point to realize most of the gains while not incurring\ntoo much cost, as in most cases the performance saturates quickly (Figure 2). As part of future work,\none could use self-consistency to generate better supervised data to \ufb01ne-tune the model, such that the\nmodel can give more accurate predictions in a single inference run after \ufb01ne-tuning. In addition, we\nobserved that language models can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical reasoning paths (e.g.,\nthe StrategyQA example in Table 4, the two population numbers are not exactly correct), and further\nwork is needed to better ground models\u2019 rationale generations.\n9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nREPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT\nIn discussion, language models can sometimes generate nonsensical or non-factual\nreasoning paths, so one should use language models\u2019 outputs with extra caution. We deal with\nreasoning tasks mostly and the generated rationales are only used for inspecting how a model reaches\nits answer. One could potentially use the generated rationales to further check why the model makes\ncertain mistakes or whether the model contains any biases when performing a certain task. For\nlanguage model in real-world use, further work is needed to better ground models\u2019 predictions and\nimprove model\u2019s factuality and safety, to ensure the models do not cause harms to users.

There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020).

This model is then used to simulate an environment and learn a control policy\nin it. Other contemporary works attempt to also learn dynamics models using raw pixels in the\n2context of games such as Atari [ 26,16], and Super Mario Bros. [ 11] as well as 3D simulations [ 16]\nand robotics [ 37,35]. We note that in all of these works, in addition to the state space being raw\npixels\u2014the action space is \ufb01xed and orders of magnitude smaller than in text games.\nIn textual environments, the traditional state representations of choice have been raw text encodings\nvia recurrent neural networks [ 24,14,13] but have since shifted towards transformer [ 34] and\nknowledge graph-based representations [ 3,1]. Knowledge graphs have been shown to be aid in the\nchallenges of: (1) knowledge representation [ 3,1], enabling neuro-symbolic reasoning approaches\nover graph-based state representations [ 29]; (2) combinatorial state-action spaces [ 2,1]; and (3)\nincorporating external knowledge sources for commonsense reasoning [ 3,21,22,9]. Two of these\nworks are perhaps closest in spirit to ours. Yao et al.

As", " Introduction\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\n\ufb02exible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),", " Introduction.

Dynamic\nGraph Cnn for Learning on Point", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript\u210e\ud835\udc61h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121subscript\u210e\ud835\udc611h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position t\ud835\udc61titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n \n\n2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\u00a03.2.\n\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned", " Introduction to the conll-2003 shared task:\nLanguage-independent named entity recognition.

By enabling efficient grading of open-ended questions, LLMs could enhance the quality of feedback provided to students, leading to improved learning outcomes and deeper engagement with the material. This advancement could pave the way for more personalized learning experiences and frequent assessments, ultimately contributing to a more adaptive educational environment. Furthermore, it could stimulate further research into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in diverse educational contexts, fostering innovation in assessment methodologies.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem include the inherent complexity of accurately grading open-ended responses, which often require nuanced understanding and contextual interpretation. Naive approaches may fail due to the variability in student responses, the need for contextual knowledge, and the subtleties of language that LLMs must grasp to provide accurate assessments. Additionally, there are technical obstacles such as ensuring the models generalize well across different educational settings and the limited availability of diverse datasets for training and evaluation, which complicates the development of robust ASAG systems.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has been limited by a reliance on handcrafted grading systems or fine-tuning models for specific tasks, which necessitated extensive technical expertise and large datasets that were often unavailable. The lack of publicly available datasets from educational settings has hindered the ability to test and validate LLMs effectively. Additionally, earlier approaches may not have fully leveraged the capabilities of LLMs, which have only recently shown promise in handling novel datasets with minimal prompt engineering. This paper's introduction of the AMMORE dataset addresses these gaps by providing a rich resource for evaluating LLM performance in grading open-ended responses.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nThe proposed methodology involves utilizing the AMMORE dataset, which contains 53,000 student responses to middle school math questions, to train and evaluate LLMs for ASAG.

By developing a platform that utilizes LLMs to tailor assessments to individual learning trajectories, we can potentially transform how students interact with STEM content, making learning more relevant and effective. The implications for the research community are significant; this work could lead to advancements in adaptive learning technologies and the development of more nuanced educational frameworks. Furthermore, the practical applications of this research extend beyond improved academic performance, as it can equip educators with actionable insights, thereby enhancing teaching strategies and fostering a more inclusive learning environment.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nSolving this problem is challenging due to the complexities involved in accurately modeling individual learning paths and preferences. The integration of identity-aware and position-aware techniques requires sophisticated algorithms that can analyze student interactions in real time, which is technically demanding. Naive approaches may fail because they often rely on static assessments that do not account for the dynamic nature of learning or the diverse backgrounds of students. Additionally, practical obstacles include ensuring the system's scalability, maintaining data privacy, and creating effective feedback mechanisms that provide meaningful insights to both students and educators. Overcoming these challenges necessitates a deep understanding of educational psychology, machine learning, and user experience design.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research in adaptive learning technologies has often been limited by a lack of integration between personalized assessment methods and real-time feedback mechanisms. Many existing solutions do not leverage the capabilities of LLMs to generate tailored problem sets dynamically, resulting in a one-size-fits-all approach to assessments. Barriers such as insufficient access to advanced computational resources, inadequate datasets for training LLMs, and the complexity of creating identity-aware systems have hindered progress in this area. My approach differs from prior work by incorporating a hybrid architecture that combines both identity-awareness and position-awareness, allowing for a more nuanced and effective personalization of assessments. This innovative methodology aims to address the limitations identified in existing literature regarding formative assessments in STEM education.\n\n[Question 5]: What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nMy proposed methodology involves developing an interactive educational platform that utilizes LLMs to generate personalized formative assessments based on real-time student performance data and interactions. The platform will employ a hybrid architecture that integrates identity-aware and position-aware techniques, allowing for the continuous adaptation of learning paths. I will utilize a diverse dataset comprising student interaction logs and performance metrics from various educational contexts to train the model. The effectiveness of the platform will be evaluated using metrics such as student engagement levels, mastery of STEM concepts, and feedback quality from both students and educators.

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu et\u00a0al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et\u00a0al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling responses (Singla", " INTRODUCTION\nProviding meaningful feedback to learners is one of\nthe most important tasks of instructors [1]. yet it can\nalso become one of the most work-intensive or even te-\ndious tasks. Particularly for large-enrollment courses,\nlack of grading personnel can limit this feedback to\nautomatically gradable closed-answer formats such as\nmultiple-choice or numerical inputs. This limitation\nmight be overcome by using Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI)\nsolutions [2]; it is therefore not surprising that when it\ncomes to the use of AI in higher education, assessment\nand evaluation are the most prominent topics [3], and\nacceptance of this technology for education is increasing\nbased on its perceived usefulness [4]. In particular, stud-\nies on Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) [5, 6]\nare highly relevant for educators to extend the limits of\nwhat can be assessed at large scales.\nIt is impossible to do justice to the spectrum of so-\nphisticated ASAG methods in this short study; Burrows,\nGurevych, and Stein provide an excellent overview up\nto 2015 [5]; Haller, Aldea, Seifert, and Strisciuglio look\nat later developments up to 2022 [6]. The latter sur-\nvey notes a particular shift in recent years as models are\nmoving from hand-engineered features to representation-\nlearning approaches, which draw their initial training\ndata from large text corpora [6] (\u201cpre-trained\u201d). How-\never, most models used for ASAG still have in common\nthat they are explicitly trained or \ufb01ne-tuned for particu-\nlar grading tasks, and datasets used in competitions such\nas SemEval [7] thus include training and testing items.\nBy contrast, recently publicly released Large Language\nModels (LLMs) such as GPT-4 [8] and Bard [9] have not\nonly been pre-trained from large text corpora, but subse-\nquently extensively \ufb01ne-tuned following general instead\nof task-speci\ufb01c strategies.

However, artificial \nintelligence, including LLMs , is hard to understand  \n(Longo et al., 2023; Meske et al., 2022)  and suffers \nfrom security concerns  (Schneider & Apruzzese, \n2023) . Experts also perceive substantial risks \nassociated with LLMs and have advocated for a \ndevelopment moratorium on such technologies \n(Future of Life, 2023) . In academia, LLMs are used \nas a tool by researchers and students to such an extent \nthat researchers themselves have called on journals to \nclarify the allowable extent of AI -generated content \nin scholarly papers (Tang, 2023) , leading to the \npublication of guidelines for incorporating AI in the \npaper -writing process (Aczel & Wagenmakers, 2023) . \nEthical concerns have also been raised for education \n(Yan et al., 2023)  and children  (Schneider, Kruse, et \nal., 2024) . LLMs like ChatGPT have been commonly \ncompared against students in various disciplines \u2013 \nespecially with respect to their capability to pass \nexams. While some reports have indicated inferior \nperformance than a master\u2019s graduate in mathematics \n(Frieder et al., 2023) , other instances showcase a \nsuccessful completion of an introductory physics course (Kortemeyer, 2023) , as well as the passing of \nnumerous law school exams (Choi et al., 2023) . \nHowever, it is important to acknowledge the \nexistence of limitations in the LLMs. These models \ncan exhibit biases, discrimination , and factual \ninaccuracies  (Borji, 2023) . Consequently, there arises \ndoubt regarding their suitability  in education . In \nparticular, the necessity for human verification has \nbeen emphasized as a pressing research priority (van \nDis et al., 2023)  and the topic of human agency is also \ndebated on a regulatory level (EU, 2020) . Especially, \nhigh stakes decisions require careful analysis before \nAI can be utilized. Grading of exams is a high -stakes \nsituation, as errors in grading can cause students to \nfail an entire class, possibly causing a year -long delay \nin their education, separation of peers, etc. This, in \nturn, can lead to both financial and psychological \nstrain.  \nAs such it seems natural and even necessary to \nassess the suitability of LLM s for supporting exam \ngrading and to reflect upon adequate ways to include \nthem in the grading process while mitigating their \nrisks. To this end, we seek to contribute to two \nintertwined research questions:  (a) How can LLMs \nsupport educators in the grading process of exams?  \n(b) What are issues and concerns when using LLMs \nto support grading?  \nOur focus is on Automatic Short Answer Grading \n(ASAG), i.e., student replies are (short) textual answers (i.e., one or a few paragraphs). We use an \nLLM, i.e., ChatGPT to assess the instructor\u2019s answer, \na student\u2019s answer in general as well as a student\u2019s \nanswer with respect to the instructor\u2019s answer as \nillustrated in Figure 1. In our experimental eva luation, \nwe use d two exams from two educators. ", " Introduction\nOpen-ended questions \u2014 questions that require\nstudents to produce multi-word, nontrivial responses\n\u2014 are a popular assessment tool in educational en-\nvironments because they offer students the chance to\nexplore their understanding of learning material. Such\nquestions provide valuable insight into students\u2019 grasp\nof complex concepts and their problem-solving ap-\nproaches. However, grading open-ended questions can\nbe time-consuming, subjective, and \u2014 especially in thecase of large class sizes \u2014 prone to attentional errors.\nThese factors create a critical bottleneck in precision\neducation.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) present an op-\nportunity to automate and promote equity in learning\nassessments, providing rapid valuable feedback to stu-\ndents while reducing the burden on instructors. We\ndeveloped a tool that automatically assesses students\u2019\nresponses to open-ended questions by evaluating their\nresponses against a set of instructor-defined criteria.\nTo use our tool, the instructor poses a question along\nwith optional grading criteria. Students respond to\nthese questions, and their answers are relayed to a\nserver. The responses are paired with the grading cri-\nteria (which are not revealed to the student), forming\na payload for a large language model (LLM). The LLM\nthen generates automated feedback, suggesting areas\nfor improvement to the student.\nHere, we describe the technical design of our tool,\nFreeText, and showcase its utility in educational envi-\nronments spanning topics and complexity. We further\noutline the implications of our work for teaching com-\nplex subjects, and the potential role of large language\nmodelsineducation( Fig.1).

Early automated grading\ntools focused on \u2018solvable\u2019 tasks like math or program-\nming assignments, where grading generally relies on\nunit tests or direct output comparisons (Hollingsworth,\n1960; Ureel II and Wallace, 2019; Orr and Russell,\n2021; Messer et al., 2023). These approaches often\noverlook less easily-quantified but nonetheless critical\nindicatorsoflearningandunderstanding, suchasdesign\nquality, code maintainability, or potential areas of stu-\ndent confusion. Modern tools, like AutoGrader, which\nprovides real-time grading for programming exercises,\nremain narrowly focused on output correctness and do\nnotsufficientlyaccountfordocumentationormaintain-\nability (Liu et al., 2019).\nAssessing students\u2019 understanding from natural\nlanguage responses, however, presents different chal-\nlenges and has seen significant evolution. Early Au-\ntomated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) models em-\nployed statistical or domain-specific neural network ap-\nproaches (Heilman and Madnani, 2013; Riordan et al.,\n2017; Sung et al., 2019). In recent years, LLMs have\nbeen shown to outperform domain-specific language\nmodels (Radford et al., 2019; Mizumoto et al., 2019;\nBrown et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2022). LLMs fa-\ncilitate grading of open-ended assignment responses,\nwithout the need for task-specific fine-tuning (Cao,\n2023;MizumotoandEguchi,2023;Yoon,2023). How-\never, Kortemeyer (2023) revealed that while LLMs\nlike GPT-4 could be useful for preliminary grading of\nintroductory physics assignments, they fell short for\nnatural-language responses required in comprehensive\nexam grading.", " Introduction\nMany NLP applications require high-quality labeled data, notably to train classi\ufb01ers or evaluate\nthe performance of unsupervised models. For example, researchers often aim to \ufb01lter noisy social\nmedia data for relevance, assign texts to different topics or conceptual categories, or measure\ntheir sentiment or stance. Regardless of the speci\ufb01c approach used for these tasks (supervised,\nsemi-supervised, or unsupervised), labeled data are needed to build a training set or a gold standard\nagainst which performance can be assessed. Such data may be available for high-level tasks\nsuch as semantic evaluation (Emerson et al., 2022). More typically, however, researchers have to\nconduct original annotations to ensure that the labels match their conceptual categories (Benoit\net al., 2016). Until recently, two main strategies were available. First, researchers can recruit and\ntrain coders, such as research assistants. Second, they can rely on crowd-workers on platforms\n\u0003Corresponding author (https://fabriziogilardi.org/).arXiv:2303.15056v2  [cs.CL]  19 Jul 2023ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for text-annotation tasks\nsuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Often, these two strategies are used in combination:\ntrained annotators create a relatively small gold-standard dataset, and crowd-workers are employed\nto increase the volume of labeled data. Trained annotators tend to produce high-quality data,\nbut involve signi\ufb01cant costs. Crowd workers are a much cheaper and more \ufb02exible option, but\nthe quality may be insuf\ufb01cient, particularly for complex tasks and languages other than English.\nMoreover, there have been concerns that MTurk data quality has decreased (Chmielewski and\nKucker, 2020), while alternative platforms such as CrowdFlower and FigureEight are no longer\npracticable options for academic research since they were acquired by Appen, a company that is\nfocused on a business market.\nThis paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for text annotation tasks, with a\nfocus on ChatGPT, which was released in November 2022. It demonstrates that zero-shot ChatGPT\nclassi\ufb01cations (that is, without any additional training) outperform MTurk annotations, at a fraction\nof the cost. LLMs have been shown to perform very well for a wide range of purposes, including\nideological scaling (Wu et al., 2023), the classi\ufb01cation of legislative proposals (Nay, 2023), the\nresolution of cognitive psychology tasks (Binz and Schulz, 2023), and the simulation of human\nsamples for survey research (Argyle et al., 2023). While a few studies suggested that ChatGPT\nmight perform text annotation tasks of the kinds we have described (Kuzman, Mozeti \u02c7c and Ljube\u0161i \u00b4c,\n2023; Huang, Kwak and An, 2023), to the best of our knowledge our work is the \ufb01rst systematic\nevaluation. Our analysis relies on a sample of 6,183 documents, including tweets and news articles\nthat we collected for a previous study (Alizadeh et al., 2022) as well as a new sample of tweets\nposted in 2023. In our previous study, the texts were labeled by trained annotators (research\nassistants) for \ufb01ve different tasks: relevance, stance, topics, and two kinds of frame detection.\nUsing the same codebooks that we developed to instruct our research assistants, we submitted the\ntasks to ChatGPT as zero-shot classi\ufb01cations, as well as to crowd-workers on MTurk. We then\nevaluated the performance of ChatGPT against two benchmarks: (i) its accuracy, relative to that\nof crowd-workers, and (ii) its intercoder agreement, relative to that of crowd workers as well as\nof our trained annotators. We \ufb01nd that across the four datasets, ChatGPT\u2019s zero-shot accuracy is\nhigher than", " Introduction\nChatGPT has shown strong capabilities as a dia-\nlogue system, providing clearer and more helpful\nanswers than humans (Guo et al., 2023).

(2023) analyzed its zero-shot per-formance on reasoning tasks, natural language in-\nference, dialogue, question answering, summariza-\ntion, named-entity recognition and sentiment anal-\nysis. The results have sparked questions\nwhether extensive manual annotation is still needed\nfor such text classi\ufb01cation tasks. In the future, we\nplan to explore the impact of the sizes of manually-\nannotated datasets to the performance of \ufb01ne-tuned\nmodels, compared to the zero-shot performance\nof ChatGPT. In addition, as using ChatGPT and\nsimilar models for annotation of very large text\ncollections is computationally expensive, we might\nexperiment with using large language models to an-\nnotate the training data as an alternative to manual\nannotation, and then \ufb01ne-tune base-sized models\nfor annotation of large quantities of data.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has received funding from the Euro-\npean Union\u2019s Connecting Europe Facility 2014-\n2020 - CEF Telecom, under Grant Agreement No.\nINEA/CEF/ICT/A2020/2278341.

The success of large language\nmodels (LLMs) is often attributed to (in-context) few-shot or zero-shot learning. It can solve various\ntasks by simply conditioning the models on a few examples (few-shot) or instructions describing the\ntask (zero-shot). The method of conditioning the language model is called \u201cprompting\u201d [Liu et al.,\n2021b], and designing prompts either manually [Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2021, Reynolds and McDonell,\n2021] or automatically [Gao et al., 2021, Shin et al., 2020] has become a hot topic in NLP.\n\u0003Work done while at The University of Tokyo.\n36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2205.11916v4  [cs.CL]  29 Jan 2023(c) Zero-shot \nQ: A juggler can juggle 16 balls.

AS approaches have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of human grading effort and scale well to an ever-increasing student population. AS has been studied in many different contexts, especially essays, known as automated essay scoring (AES)\u00a0[1, 18], but also in other contexts such as automatic short answer grading (ASAG)\u00a0[23, 31] for domains including humanities, social sciences\u00a0[21], and math\u00a0[3].\n\n\nExisting approaches for AS include feature engineering, i.e., developing features that summarize the length, syntax\u00a0[4, 9, 18], cohesion\u00a0[11], relevance to the item\u00a0[19], and semantics\u00a0[25] of student responses combined with machine learning-based classifiers\u00a0[2, 16] to predict the score. These approaches have excellent interpretability but require human expertise in feature development. Recent approaches leverage advances in deep learning to produce better textual representations of student responses, alleviating the need to rely on human-engineered features. Examples include combining neural networks with human-engineered features for score prediction\u00a0[24] and especially approaches that fine-tune neural language models (LMs) such as BERT\u00a0[8] and GPT-2\u00a0[20] on the downstream AS task\u00a0[14, 15, 22, 28]. Despite concerns on the vulnerability against gaming input\u00a0[14] and fairness aspects\u00a0[13] of these approaches, they have performed well in terms of scoring accuracy on publicly available benchmark datasets such as the automated student assessment prize (ASAP) for essay scoring\u00a0[1].\n\n\nHowever, existing AS approaches are limited in many ways, including a significant one we address in this paper: They almost always train a separate AS model for each item. This approach is acceptable in contexts such as AES since the items (essay prompts) are likely not highly related to each other. However, in other contexts such as reading comprehension, multiple items may share the same background passage; Training a separate model for each item fails to leverage this shared background information. More importantly, this approach results in a separate model for each item; for LM-based models that have millions of parameters, this approach creates a significant model storage problem.\n\n\n\n1.0.1 Contributions\n\nIn this paper, we detail a novel AS approach for reading comprehension items via in-context fine-tuning of LMs, which is our (grand prize-winning) solution to the item-specific part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) automated scoring challenge.111Ran by the US Dept.\u00a0of Education: https://github.com/NAEP-AS-Challenge/info We make our implementation publicly available222Our code can be found at: https://github.com/ni9elf/automated-scoring to facilitate future work on automated scoring. Our contributions are listed below:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe develop an AS approach based on multi-task and meta-learning ideas, which fine-tunes an LM with a carefully designed input format that captures the context of each individual item. Our approach effectively leverages potential linkage across all items.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our AS approach through experimental evaluation on the NAEP challenge training dataset. Our approach outperforms existing LM-based AS approaches and significantly outperforms other non-LM-based baselines.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe qualitatively analyze the cause of scoring errors made by our approach. We also show that our AS approach exhibits modest bias towards different student demographic groups. We outline a series of avenues for future work to improve the applicability of our approach in real-world settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2", " Introduction\nOver the last few years, very large neural networks trained for language understanding and generation have\nachieved astonishing Related Work\nNatural language capabilities have signi\fcantly advanced through large scale language modeling over the\nlast several years. Broadly, language modeling refers to approaches for predicting either the next token in\na sequence or for predicting masked spans (Devlin et al., 2019; Ra\u000bel et al., 2020). These self-supervised\nobjectives when applied to vast corpora including data scraped from the internet, books, and forums, have\nresulted in models with advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Predictable power-laws\nof model quality through scaling the amount of data, parameters, and computation have made this a reliable\napproach for increasingly more capable models (Kaplan et al., 2020).\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) unleashed unparalleled e\u000eciency on modern accelerators\nand has become the de-facto approach for language models. In the span of only four years, the largest\nmodels have increased in size and total computation by several orders of magnitude. One of the \frst major\nsuccesses of scale was the 345M parameter encoder-only BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019) which signi\fcantly\nadvanced language understanding across classi\fcation tasks, including SuperGLUE. The Generative Pre-\ntrained Transformer (GPT) series, decoder-only models, (Radford et al., 2018; Ra\u000bel et al., 2020) set\nstate-of-the-art language modeling performance. Ra\u000bel et al. (2020) then pre-trained and \fne-tuned up to 11B\nparameter encoder-decoder models, setting a new bar in transfer learning. The most recent model in the GPT\nseries, the 175B parameter GPT-3 model (Brown et al., 2020) uncovered new capabilities from inference-only,\nfew-shot techniques. Scale has continued to increase after GPT-3, evidenced by the succession of the 178B\nparameter Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), the 280B parameter Gopher model (Rae et al., 2021), the 530B\nMegatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) as well as trillion parameter sparse models including Switch\nTransformers (Fedus et al., 2021) and GLaM (Du et al., 2021). These advances in core natural language\ncapabilities have also been accompanied with improvements in other domains, including understanding and\ngenerating code (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). Additionally, dialogue applications have advanced\nthrough scale, as most recently evidenced by LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), a 137B decoder-only model.\nFinally, additional work has enabled language models to follow instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022a) { improving the usefulness and reliability of these models.\nThese larger models no longer can be e\u000eciently trained or even \ft into the memory of a single accelerator.\nTherefore, techniques have arisen for splitting model tensors across accelerators (Shazeer et al., 2018) or\nalternatively separating layers of the models across accelerators and then pipe-lining activations between\nthe stages (Huang et al., 2019). Many other works aim to increase of the scale of models, while limiting\ncommunication overheads (Rajbhandari et al., 2020; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Rasley et al.,\n2020; Rajbhandari et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Narayanan et al., 2021a). PaLM uses a blend of data and\nmodel-parallelism enabled through the Pathways infrastructure (Barham et al., 2022).\nArchitectural variants have been proposed to help scale models more e\u000eciently. One area is retrieval models\nthat aim to drastically reduce model sizes by embedding large amounts of text the model can have access to\nlater (Guu et al.,", " INTRODUCTION\nIn the education field, large attention is dedicated to characterizing the learning process of students\nto determine the efficiency and success of learners in acquiring new knowledge. Assessing and\nquantifying the knowledge gain are fundamental aspects for evaluating the quality of the learning\nprocess. Due to the time-consuming and individual nature of the assessment process, it is crucial to\nrender it as efficient as possible, e.g. by using some level of grading automation, while retaining or\neven improving its quality [44].\nBesides formative assessment (e.g. teacher feedback of assignments), the main method of assess-\nment is via summative assessment (e.g. written examinations) [ 69], where knowledge acquired by\nthe students can be tested in several ways. Different types of questions can be formulated: closed-\nform questions (e.g. multiple-choice) or open answer questions (e.g. essays or short answers) [ 2].\nAutomated grading for multiple-choice questions is straightforward and immediate. Automated\nEssay Scoring (AES) and Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) are more challenging tasks\nbecause the assessment of these answers requires an understanding of the text and a more detailed\nanalysis [ 39,69]. The main difference between AES and ASAG is that the latter deals with short\nanswers usually graded against a reference answer, whereas the former is concerned with scoring\nlonger textual answers and the grading is based on evaluating the quality in terms of spelling,\ngrammar and coherence, and less on compact information content [39].\nThe assessment of textual open answers is challenging and requires techniques and approaches\nfrom different fields, such as natural language processing (NLP), text understanding, and reading\nAuthors\u2019 addresses: Stefan Haller, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, s.m.haller@student.utwente.nl; Adina\nAldea, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, a.aldea@utwente.nl; Christin Seifert, University of Twente,\nEnschede, The Netherlands and - University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany, christin.seifert@uni-due.de; Nicola\nStrisciuglio, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, n.strisciuglio@utwente.nl.\n, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

These advancements and their application to\nASAG have not been covered in recent surveys, which only reviewed conclusions were drawn in [ 24], where the authors proposed\na method focused on the textual lexical similarity, computed by using character and word n-grams.\nIn particular, the similarity was calculated taking into account the number of overlaps in the two\nsentences combined with string edit-distance features. This approach uses additional features\nfrom [ 23], which were computed according to the edit-effort it takes to align a student answer and\na reference answer. The final score was predicted by a logistic regression classifier. In addition,\ndomain adaption was used, where different features have individual weights for each domain.\n, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", " Introduction\nLarge-scale language model pretraining has become increasingly prevalent for achieving high per-\nformance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. When applying these models\nto a speci\ufb01c task, they are usually \ufb01ne-tuned using supervised learning, often to maximize the log\nprobability of a set of human demonstrations.\nWhile this strategy has led to markedly improved performance, there is still a misalignment between\nthis \ufb01ne-tuning objective\u2014maximizing the likelihood of human-written text\u2014and what we care\nabout\u2014generating high-quality outputs as determined by humans. This misalignment has several\ncauses: the maximum likelihood objective has no distinction between important errors (e.g. making\nup facts [ 41]) and unimportant errors (e.g. selecting the precise word from a set of synonyms); models\n\u0003This was a joint project of the OpenAI Re\ufb02ection team.

Controlling for length reduces the relative preference of our human feedback models, however\nthey are still preferred to the reference summaries. (b) Plotting model quality for different summary\nlengths on the TL;DR dataset. Our 6.7B human feedback model outperforms both the 6.7B supervised\nbaseline and the reference summaries (horizontal line at 0.5) across lengths.\nF Controlling for summary length\nAs discussed in Section 4.1, the length of a summary is a confounding factor for evaluating summary\nquality; depending on the desired trade-off between conciseness and coverage, a shorter or longer\nsummary might be better. Our models generate summaries that are longer than the reference\nsummaries, as this led to higher labeler preference given the 24-48 token limit for our task. Here we\ndescribe the procedure we use to attempt to control for length.\nTo calculate a single length-controlled preference number, we train a logistic regression model to\npredict the human-preferred summary on our dataset of human comparisons. We provide this model\nwith 2 features: the identity of each policy, and the log ratio of the summary lengths. To calculate\nthe length-controlled preference value between two policies, we simply give each policy ID to our\ntrained logistic regression model and set the log length ratio to zero (see Figure 10a). In Figure 10b\nwe examine summary quality across a range of summary lengths on TL;DR. We \ufb01nd that our human\nfeedback model outperforms the supervised baseline across all length values.\nFor CNN/DM, we use a similar procedure as described above to control for length, except using a\nlinear regression model to predict the Likert rating from 1-7. We show the expected quality increase\nfor making summaries 100 characters longer in Table 14, which suggests our human feedback models\nwould perform better", " Introduction\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\n\ufb02exible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance.

Introduction\n\nResearch on large language models (OpenAI, 2023) (LLMs) is expanding in scope and yielding significant scientific advancements rapidly. These language models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the text (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022). While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), BART (Lewis et\u00a0al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly called prompts (Arora et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018fine-tuning\u2019) from a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot learning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled examples from a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction to control the text generation in a desirable way beneficial to the downstream task (Mysore et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2022; Ni et\u00a0al., 2021; Pradeep et\u00a0al., 2023a). In addition to leveraging ICL for a purely generative task, e.g., question answering or abstractive summarisation (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023), a more common use is in a predictive task, such as text classification (Lu et\u00a0al., 2022; Milios et\u00a0al., 2023), where each class is specified by a set of words (commonly called a verbaliser (Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2021)), e.g., for a binary sentiment classification task the positive class could be defined by the set {{\\{{\u2018good\u2019, \u2018great\u2019, \u2018wonderful\u2019\u2026}}\\}}.\nOnce each class for a predictive task is well-defined, the generated text can be mapped to the most likely class(es) by using the posterior over the vocabulary generated by the decoder.\n\n\nIt is to be realised that ICL is somewhat conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples) - the only difference of ICL with k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN is that the former involves a frozen set of encoder-decoder parameters of an underlying LLM, where ICL generally works well on any domain with only a small number of examples because, unlike", "\n\n1 Experimental details\n\nExperiments are performed on a single machine, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6338 CPU @ 2.00GHz CPU, and evaluated using PISA. Full details for reproducing experiments are made available at the codebase:\nInference time (i.e., the time to compute query term weights and expansion, if required) is disregarded for most of the experiments, as we only compare within the same retrieval model, thus having the same inference time. Inter-model comparison is only made with relative values. Latency is always reported as the average value across the set of queries in each experiment and measured in milliseconds. Retrieval is performed with MaxScore dynamic pruning.\n\n\n\n2 Index size\n\nIn the main paper, we consider solely the retrieval inference time but ignored the index size reduction that is incurred due to pruning. We present the values in Figure\u00a0LABEL:fig:relative_effectiveness which is similar to Figure 1 of the main paper, but using relative index size instead of relative latency. We note that the compression effect is less pronounced than the speedup for most retrieval and pruning method combinations, especially for BM25 which is already pretty well compressed. The only exceptions are using SPLADE for retrieval, which we posit is because of the large size of the original index and the use of term-based pruning which makes sense as smaller posting lists are easier to compress.\n\n\n\n3 Full TREC-DL results\n\nIn this Section, we present extensions to Table 1 of the full paper, where we consider all retrievers and all pruning methods. Results are presented in tables\u00a0LABEL:tab:trec_bm25_full,\u00a0LABEL:tab:trec_unicoil_full,\u00a0LABEL:tab:trec_deepimpact_full, and \u00a0LABEL:tab:trec_splade_full. Overall we see the same results as in the shortened table of the full paper and the MSMARCO figure: we are able to get 2x speedup with \u22642%absentpercent2\\leq 2\\%\u2264 2 % loss of effectiveness and 4x speedup with \u22648%absentpercent8\\leq 8\\%\u2264 8 % loss of effectiveness with pretty much all pruning methods over all learned sparse retrieval models, however, we see that some conclusions could change, as for example, TREC-DL and SPLADE term-based pruning can sometimes be more effective than the other methods and that sometimes evaluation on TREC-DL may be skewed by a few queries, leading to a few results outside of the expected: \u201cmore pruning equals faster and more approximate method\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe emergence of instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) has expanded the horizon of applications in areas ranging from natural language processing to information retrieval to software engineering.\nThis development has been particularly influential in the realm of text ranking.\nNotably, there has been a surge in initiatives focused on zero-shot listwise reranking using LLMs, referred to as \u201cprompt-decoders\u201d, as evidenced by works such as RankGPT\u00a0Sun et\u00a0al. (2023) and LRL\u00a0Ma et\u00a0al. (2023b).\nHowever, a common limitation in these endeavors is their reliance on proprietary models.\nWhile these models facilitate rapid prototyping and are conveniently accessible via API endpoints, they pose challenges in terms of scientific reproducibility.\nThis issue is critical both from the standpoint of adhering to the principles of robust scientific methodology and practically in the context of achieving consistent, reliable measurements in experimental evaluations.\n\n\nRecently, RankVicuna\u00a0Pradeep et\u00a0al. (2023b) helped address this pressing need within the academic community for an open-source LLM that can proficiently execute reranking tasks, improving over the much larger proprietary model RankGPT3.5.\nHowever, RankVicuna still lags behind the state-of-the-art RankGPT4 in effectiveness.\nBridging this gap and striving beyond with an open-source model would be of great value to the NLP and IR communities working towards RAG architectures that require high-precision results.\n\n\nThis paper introduces RankZephyr, an open-source LLM for reranking that bridges the gap and, in a few cases, goes beyond RankGPT4, the state-of-the-art reranker.\nOur investigation is steered by several research questions, informed by comprehensive experiments and analyses:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nCan an open-source LLM, specifically RankZephyr with only 7B parameters, improve on the listwise reranking effectiveness of much larger proprietary models such as RankGPT4 in a zero-shot setting?\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWhat is the impact on effectiveness of employing multiple reranking passes over the candidate list?\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWhich training choices, including the source of hard negatives, the teacher model, the types of queries exposed, and window sizes used during distillation, are important for instruction fine-tuning a robust and effective listwise reranker?\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nHow do the selection of first-stage retrieval model and the number of top retrieved candidates affect the downstream reranking effectiveness of RankZephyr for both in-domain and out-of-domain effectiveness?\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nIn what ways do initial orderings of retrieved documents influence the effectiveness of these listwise rerankers?\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nHow do reranking models perform on uncontaminated test queries and passages originating after the model training cut-off?\n\n\n\n\n\nOur comprehensive evaluations encompass both in-domain datasets\u2014TREC 2019 and 2020 Deep Learning Tracks\u00a0Craswell et\u00a0al. (2019, 2020) from the MS MARCO v1 passage ranking task\u2014as well as out-of-domain datasets\u2014TREC 2021 and 2022 Deep Learning Tracks\u00a0Craswell et\u00a0al.

(2023).\nThese experiments reveal RankZephyr\u2019s capability to rival and occasionally surpass the reranking effectiveness of RankGPT4.\n\n\nRemarkably, RankZephyr achieves this feat by building on an open-source LLM with orders of magnitude fewer parameters.\nThe central insights from our work include:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nEffectiveness of RankZephyr: While proprietary LLMs such as RankGPT4 exhibit high reranking effectiveness, they come with limitations like non-reproducibility, non-deterministic outputs, and obscurity behind an API, impeding their utility in academic settings.\nIn contrast, RankZephyr is a much smaller open-source model that is competitive in terms of quality with", " Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demon-\nstrated remarkable success in various tasks via in-\ncontext learning (ICL) with task instructions and\nfew-shot demonstrations (input-label pairs) (Zhao\net al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022), elim-\ninating the need for fine-tuning from task-specific\nlabels. Nevertheless, in-domain demonstrations\nare usually absent in real scenarios since the target\ndomain labels are unavailable.

Therefore, the limitations above call for\neffective adaptation strategies to transfer knowl-\nedge of LMs from a labeled source domain to an\nunlabeled target domain, known as Unsupervised\nDomain Adaptation (UDA).\nTo bridge the domain gap, UDA aims to adapt\nmodels that learn domain-agnostic features from\nlabeled source samples and unlabeled target sam-\nples. Some studies have proposed discrepancy mea-\nsures to align source and target distributions in the\nrepresentation space (Ganin et al., 2016; Ye et al.,\n2020; Long et al., 2022). However, these methods to train a dense retriever.

(2021), including web search\u00a0Bajaj et\u00a0al. (2016), open-domain question answering\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2017), and fact verification\u00a0Thorne et\u00a0al. (2018).\nRetrieval also plays an important role in enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline\u00a0Lewis et\u00a0al. (2020b); Shi et\u00a0al. (2023).\nThis approach not only mitigates hallucinations but also enables LLMs to access knowledge that is not captured within their parameters\u00a0Yang et\u00a0al. (2023); Jiang et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\nA typical multi-stage text retrieval pipeline consists of a retriever, designed to efficiently locate the top-k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k relevant texts from a corpus, and a reranker, which further refines the order of the retrieved candidates to improve output quality\u00a0Nogueira and Cho (2019).\nBoth retrievers and rerankers have significantly benefited from the advent of pre-trained language models based on Transformers\u00a0Vaswani et\u00a0al. (2017) such as BERT\u00a0Devlin et\u00a0al. (2019) and T5\u00a0Raffel et\u00a0al. (2020).\nThese models are trained to encode queries and documents into vector representations for retrieval\u00a0Karpukhin et\u00a0al. (2020); Lin (2021) or to directly score the relevance between a query and a document for reranking\u00a0Nogueira et\u00a0al. (2019); Zhuang et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\nRecent large language models with billions of parameters, fine-tuned to follow instructions, such as InstructGPT\u00a0Ouyang et\u00a0al. (2022), GPT-4\u00a0OpenAI (2023), and LLaMA\u00a0Touvron et\u00a0al. (2023a, b), have exhibited extraordinary capabilities in many NLP tasks, surpassing previous smaller pre-trained language models\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2023).\nFor retrieval, recent methods such as LRL\u00a0Ma et\u00a0al. (2023), RankGPT\u00a0Sun et\u00a0al. (2023), and PRP\u00a0Qin et\u00a0al. (2023) have explored prompting LLMs to perform zero-shot reranking using pairwise or listwise approaches.\nThese methods leverage LLMs by viewing reranking as text generation.\n\n\nHowever, we see a number of potential issues.\nFirst, these methods do not address the entire multi-stage pipeline, as it is challenging to cast retrieval from a large corpus as a text generation task.\nSecond, they do not leverage labeled data when available.\nFinally, these rerankers are not efficient because they do not support parallel scoring and are slowed by their multi-pass decoding design.\n\n\nTherefore, we argue that fine-tuning state-of-the-art large language models to function as retrievers and rerankers can yield better effectiveness than previous smaller models.\nThis approach can also optimally utilize LLMs within multi-stage pipelines.\nThus, we are motivated to investigate the following research question: How do state-of-the-art large language models perform when specifically fine-tuned for multi-stage text retrieval?\n\n\nOur study aims to answer this question by conducting a comprehensive investigation into fine-tuning the latest LLaMA-2 model\u00a0Touvron et\u00a0al. (2023b), a state-of-the-art, open-source large language model, as both a retriever and a reranker, which we refer to as RepLLaMA and RankLLaMA, respectively.\nSpecifically, we utilize the MS MARCO\u00a0Bajaj et\u00a0al. (2016) and BEIR\u00a0Thakur et\u00a0al. (2021) datasets for our experiments.\nOur findings suggest that large language models surpass previous smaller models, achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness for both retrieval and reranking through a straightforward training regime and exhibiting strong zero-shot effectiveness.\nFurthermore, we observe that LLMs, which are inherently pre-trained on longer contexts, demonstrate potential in representing entire documents, thereby eliminating the need for traditional segmenting and pooling strategies for document retrieval.\n\n \n\n2 Method\n\n\n2.1 Preliminaries\n\nTask Definition\n\nGiven a query Q\ud835\udc44Qitalic_Q and a corpus C\ud835\udc36Citalic_C", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) has recently exploded in popularity. Models pre-trained on massive amounts of textual data are able to reach reasonable performance on a wide variety of tasks with only a few examples of input and output for a given task provided in the model\u2019s input prompt in natural language Brown et\u00a0al. (2020); Rae et\u00a0al. (2021); Chowdhery et\u00a0al. (2023). In this work, we study whether ICL can handle challenging classification tasks with many possible labels, by augmenting the LM with a secondary pre-trained retrieval model.\n\n\nFigure 1: Complete pipeline for intent detection with retrieval-augmented in-context learning\n\n\nThe main problem with applying ICL to tasks involving classification with many labels is the limited context window these models have. Ordinarily with ICL, at minimum one example from each class is provided in-context to allow the model to make a choice between all the labels of the task. Because of this limitation, ICL has not been directly applied to these sorts of problems. In this work we relax this requirement, allowing the model to see only a subset of the most relevant labels for the given datapoint we are performing inference on. By testing on intent classification (upwards of 50 classes) and fine-grained sentiment analysis (upwards of 25 classes), we demonstrate that the resulting performance with this method can reach SoTA. By coupling the LLM with an external pre-trained dense retriever model Reimers and Gurevych (2019a); Karpukhin et\u00a0al. (2020), we can dynamically retrieve a set of examples to provide to the LM in-context, that reflects only the most relevant labels to the current example in the label space. Most existing work on augmenting LMs with retrieval models Ram et\u00a0al. (2023); Shi et\u00a0al. (2023) focuses on tuning the retrieval and/or LM. We demonstrate that even without tuning either, when the pre-trained models are strong enough we can still achieve SoTA across various tasks using ICL.\n\n\nWe evaluate LLMs in this setting with three intent classification datasets: BANKING77 Casanueva et\u00a0al. (2020), HWU64 Liu et\u00a0al. (2019), and CLINC150 Larson et\u00a0al. (2019), as well as one fine-grained sentiment classification dataset: GoEmotions Demszky et\u00a0al. (2020). Experiments are done using the LLaMA models Touvron et\u00a0al. (2023) and the OPT models Zhang et\u00a0al. (2022) as LLMs. We compare the performance achieved against adapter-based fine-tuning of MLM models (DeBERTa-v2-XXLarge with the \u201cPfeiffer\u201d bottleneck-style adapter Pfeiffer et\u00a0al. (2020b) implemented with AdapterHub Pfeiffer et\u00a0al.

(2022), a recent lightweight method involving contrastive training of small MLM models.\n\n\nThe contributions of this work are:\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nWe show that retrieval-augmented ICL is an effective way to tackle text classification tasks with many labels without additional tuning of either the retriever or the LM, either matching or outperforming fine-tuned adapter-based and contrastive-pre-training-based methods. Notably, truncating the dataset by showing only a subset to the LM at a time does not prevent us from achieving SoTA performance, and allows us to apply LLMs to problems that they have not been applied to before,\n\n\n\n2.\n\nWe analyze ICL performance over different numbers", " Introduction\nLanguage models have become an important and\nflexible building block in a variety of user-facing\nlanguage technologies, including conversational\ninterfaces, search and summarization, and collabo-\nrative writing (Shuster et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al.,\n2022; Lee et al., 2022, inter alia ).

Existing results usually significantly underperform well-trained baseline rankers (e.g.,\u00a0Nogueira et\u00a0al. (2020); Zhuang et\u00a0al. (2023)). The only exception is a recent approach proposed by\u00a0Sun et\u00a0al. (2023b), which depends on the blackbox commercial GPT-4 system. Besides the technical concerns such as sensitivity to input order (ranking metrics can drop by more than 50% when the input document order changes), we argue that relying on such blackbox systems is not ideal for academic researchers due to significant cost constraints and access limitations to these systems, though we do acknowledge the value of such explorations in showing the capabilities of LLMs for ranking tasks.\n\n\nIn this work, we first discuss why it is difficult for LLMs to perform ranking tasks with existing methods, specifically, the pointwise and listwise formulations. For pointwise approaches, ranking requires LLMs to output calibrated prediction probabilities before sorting, which is known to be very difficult and is not even supported by the generation-only LLM APIs (such as GPT-4). For listwise approaches, even with instructions that look very clear to humans, LLMs can frequently generate conflicting or useless outputs, which happens especially often for moderate-sized LLMs that are used in our experiments. Such observations show that existing popular LLMs do not fully understand ranking tasks, potentially due to the lack of ranking awareness during their pre-training and (instruction) fine-tuning procedures.\n\n\nWe propose the Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) paradigm, which uses the query and a pair of documents in the prompt for LLMs to perform ranking tasks, with the motivation to significantly reduce the task complexity for LLMs and resolve the calibration issue. PRP is based on simple prompt design and naturally supports both generation and scoring LLMs APIs. We describe several variants of PRP to address efficiency concerns. PRP results are the first in the literature that can achieve state-of-the-art ranking performance by using moderate-sized, open-sourced LLMs on standard benchmark datasets. On TREC-DL2020, PRP based on the FLAN-UL2 model with 20B parameters outperforms the previous best approach in the literature, based on the blackbox commercial GPT-4 that has (an estimated) 50X model size, by over 5% at NDCG@1. On TREC-DL2019, PRP is only inferior to the GPT-4 solution on the NDCG@5 and NDCG@10 metrics, but can outperform existing solutions, such as InstructGPT which has 175B parameters, by over 10% for nearly all ranking metrics. We also show competitive results using FLAN-T5 models with 3B and 13B parameters, demonstrating the power and generality of PRP. The observations are further validated on seven BEIR datasets covering various domains, where PRP performs competitively with supervised rankers and outperforms other LLM based approaches by a large margin. We further discuss other", " Introduction\nQuestion answering over knowledge bases\n(KBQA) (Berant et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2015)\nhas been a long-standing research problem in the\nAI community. It has attracted wide attention\nfrom the community with its signi\ufb01cant role in\nmaking large-scale knowledge bases accessible to\nnon-expert users (Wu et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2021;\nGu et al., 2022).

The \ufb01nal answer can\nbe obtained after the execution of the \ufb01nal candidates.\ntopics, it poses a great challenge for suppliers\nwith limited resources, who rely on the models\ntrained on certain knowledge bases or benchmarks.\nConcretely, the dif\ufb01culties primarily lie in the\nfollowing aspects: 1) Data intensiveness: larger\nknowledge bases require ever larger quantities\nof annotated data to allow \ufb01ne-tuned models\nto generalize well over them. (Yih et al., 2016;\nTalmor and Berant, 2018; Gu et al., 2020). 2)\nDataset speci\ufb01city: For relatively small-scale\nKBQA datasets, the fully-trained models tend\nto over\ufb01t to a speci\ufb01c schema, and can hardly\ngeneralize to knowledge base questions in unseen\ndomains (Su et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Sun\net al., 2019). These challenges make it crucial to\ndevise a new framework that can work in both\nlow-resource and training-free settings in KBQA.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) like\nGPT-3 and Codex (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al.,arXiv:2305.01750v2  [cs.CL]  4 May 20232021a) have demonstrated their strong generaliz-\nability (Wang et al., 2022a; Wei et al., 2022b; Zhou\net al., 2022b; Cheng et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022a;\nSuzgun et al., 2022) on a wide range of text, table,\ncommonsense and even math QA tasks with few-\nshot in-context learning. Other works also validate\nthat Codex (Chen et al., 2021a) can parse and trans-\nform unstructured instructions to structured and\nexecutable code with only a few dozen demonstra-\ntions (Gao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). These\nworks inspire us to tackle KBQA with LLMs, an\nunder-explored area in the literature that is par-\nticularly challenging compared to other QA tasks\nbecause of the massive scale of modern KBs.\nHowever, it is still unclear how to address\nKBQA with in-context learning. Unlike many other\nquestion-answering tasks, where the evidence is\nprovided with a reasonable length limit, KBQA\nneeds to condition on a massive graph containing\nmillions of nodes and billions of edges. Evidently,\nit is impossible to feed the whole graph as-is to\nthe language model. Even feeding a subgraph is\nextremely challenging as it requires splitting the\nmonolithic graph into self-consistent and query-\nrelevant chunks, which is itself an unaddressed\nresearch problem. Without feeding the knowledge\ngraph as an additional input, language models be-\ncome unaware of the schema of the KB. This prob-\nlem makes it dif\ufb01cult to associate surface forms in\nthe questions with the corresponding entities and\nrelation types in a speci\ufb01c KB, not to mention gen-\nerate", " Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as Chat-\nGPT and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2022, 2023), are revolu-\ntionizing natural language processing with strong\nzero-shot and few-shot generalization.

Earliest explorations (Liu, 2009)\nmostly rely on handcrafted numerical features to\nrepresent each query-document pair (Qin and Liu,\n2013; Chapelle and Chang, 2011) and put more em-\nphasis on the learning algorithms such as ranking\nlosses (Qin et al., 2021). Progress on pretrained lan-\nguage models in the past few years (Devlin et al.,\n2019) and the release of large-scale public data\nsets (Bajaj et al., 2016; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019)\nenable a series of work (Lin et al., 2020; Nogueira\net al., 2019; Han et al., 2020) on text ranking mod-\nels which directly encode textual query and docu-ment using pretrained language models, noticeably\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019).\nRecently, pretrained language models such as\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and GPT3 (Brown et al.,\n2020) have shown superior performance in various\nNLP tasks including sentiment analysis, corefer-\nence resolution, and translation. Such models often\nhave much larger size available than previous mod-\nels such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to store\nmore hidden knowledge. They also mostly have a\nsequence-to-sequence interface to unify different\nNLP tasks from classi\ufb01cation to text generation.\nWhile BERT-based models have been well ex-\nplored for text ranking (Lin et al., 2020; Nogueira\net al., 2019; Han et al., 2020), how to leverage T5\nfor text ranking is still under-explored and chal-\nlenging. First, while many classi\ufb01cation and text\ngeneration tasks \ufb01t into the sequence-to-sequence\nframework, it is more tricky for text ranking tasks:\na text ranking model is often expected to output\na numerical ranking score ^y2Rfor each query-\ndocument pair. Second, it is important to train a\ntext ranking model with ranking losses to optimize\nits ranking performance, where the losses take into\naccount the ranking scores from multiple docu-\nments for each query. This is different from the\ntypical T5 \ufb01ne-tuning strategy where the objective\nis often formulated into a text generation loss for\neach single input sequence independently.\nA typical approach to use T5 for text ranking\nis to convert the problem into a token generation\nproblem. For example, Nogueira et al. (2020) \ufb01ne-\ntune the T5 model to predict a \u201c true \u201d or \u201cfalse \u201d\ntoken for a relevant or irrelevant query-document\npair and then use a postprocessing step during in-\nference to derive ranking scores to rank candidate\ndocuments. Such an approach can be considered\na \u201cpointwise\u201d classi\ufb01cation formulation. How to\nextend this approach to \ufb01ne-tune T5 with ranking\nlosses is unclear.\nIn this paper, we propose RankT5 with the goalarXiv:2210.10634v1  [cs.IR]  12 Oct 2022to support text ranking more natively with T5 by\noutputting real numbers, instead of text tokens. We\n\ufb01rst adapt the encoder-decoder structure for this\ngoal. In addition, we also propose an alternative\nstructure which omits the decoder from T5 and out-\nputs real numbers based on the encoder, called the\nencoder-only structure. These two structure vari-\nants allow us to \ufb01ne-tune T5 with various ranking\nlosses to directly optimize ranking performance. Experiments\nWe also conduct the zero-shot Related Work\nLeveraging pretrained language models for text\nranking tasks is becoming the state-of-the-art (Lin\net al., 2020). We review recent literature on utiliz-\ning such models for text ranking tasks.\nModel structure. Pretrained language models\naccept a text sequence as", "ABSTRACT\nMuch recent research on information retrieval has focused on how to transfer\nfrom one task (typically with abundant supervised data) to various other tasks\nwhere supervision is limited, with the implicit assumption that it is possible to\ngeneralize from one task to all the rest. However, this overlooks the fact that\nthere are many diverse and unique retrieval tasks, each targeting different search\nintents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot\nDense Retrieval , a setting where each task comes with a short description and\na few examples. To amplify the power of a few examples, we propose Prompt-\nbase Query Generation for Retriever ( PROMPTAGATOR\n ), which leverages large\nlanguage models (LLM) as a few-shot query generator, and creates task-speci\ufb01c\nretrievers based on the generated data. Powered by LLM\u2019s generalization ability,\nPROMPTAGATOR makes it possible to create task-speci\ufb01c end-to-end retrievers solely\nbased on a few examples without using Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al.,\n2019) or MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) to train dual encoders. Surprisingly,\nLLM prompting with no more than 8 examples allows dual encoders to outperform\nheavily engineered models trained on MS MARCO like ColBERT v2 (Santhanam\net al., 2022) by more than 1.2 nDCG on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further\ntraining standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0\npoint nDCG improvement. Our studies determine that query generation can be\nfar more effective than previously observed, especially when a small amount of\ntask-speci\ufb01c knowledge is given.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nRecently, major progress has been made on neural retrieval models such as dual encoders, which can\nretrieve knowledge from a large collection of documents containing millions to billions of passages\n(Yih et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al., 2020). However, Thakur et al. (2021) recently\nproposed the BEIR heterogeneous retrieval benchmark, and showed that it is still dif\ufb01cult for neural\nretrievers to perform well on a wide variety of retrieval tasks that lack dedicated training data. Thus,\nprevious approaches focus on transferring knowledge from question answering (QA) datasets such\nas MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016). To best transfer from QA datasets, expressive retrievers\nare developed that allow \ufb01ne-grained token-level interaction such as ColBERT (Khattab & Zaharia,\n2020; Santhanam et al., 2022) and SPLADE (Formal et al., 2021) but with higher inference cost.\nData augmentation via synthetic question generation has previously been explored (Ma et al., 2021;\nShakeri et al., 2020), but these question generators are typically only trained on popular QA datasets.\nWe argue that it is hard to expect models based on one or two QA datasets to perform well across\ndifferent retrieval tasks. First, different retrieval tasks have very different search intents ; in other\nwords, different de\ufb01nitions of \u201crelevance\u201d. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1(a), both Dbpedia-\nEntity (Hasibi et al., 2017) and FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) are tasks to retrieve documents from\nWikipedia. Dbpedia-Entity is a task to retrieve entities that are mentioned in the query, while\nFEVER is a task to \ufb01nd evidence that either supports or refutes a given statement. Which document\nis relevant to the query can be very different from one task to another task even if they share the same\n1arXiv:2209.11755v1  [cs.CL]  23 Sep 2022Retrieval Performance on 1 1 BEIR Datasets\n46.6\n45.547.849.952.8Promptagator++ Zero-shotSupervised", " Introduction.

These models are\ncomposed of Transformer layers, which use self-attention opera-\ntions [ 19] to contextualize and interact query and document [ 3,16].\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/luyug/mores_plus.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nInternational 4.0 License.\nSIGIR \u201922, July 11\u201315, 2022, Madrid, Spain\n\u00a92022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\nACM ISBN 978-1-4503-8732-3/22/07.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531860Despite their success, Transformer LMs have pre-set input length\nlimits, typically 512, due to complexity considerations [ 4,15,23].\nAs a result, re-ranking long documents beyond this length has\nbeen a challenging problem. Prior research designed techniques\nto accommodate the neural LM. For example, some attempts to\nstrategically limit the input length, which however prohibits full\ninteraction among all query and document tokens. Others have\nturned to more efficient Transformers that use lower complexity but\nalso lower capacity sparse self-attention. In this paper, we present\nan alternative method, re-ranking documents with a modular re-\nranker and a new form of attention operation, query to document\ncross attention.\nModular re-rankers such as MORES [ 7] provide an alternative\nframework to common re-rankers. With MORES, query and docu-\nment are independently encoded. A Transformer Interaction Mod-\nule then makes relevance estimates using light-weight query-to-\ndocument attention. In this paper, we introduce a modification to\nthis framework, MORES+, for long document re-ranking. We break\na candidate document into passage-like chunks and encode them\nseparately using identical Transformer encoders. A joint query-to-\nall-chunk attention then models interaction between query and the\nfulldocument. The model can flexibly control the attention weights\nto pick up important information. This design roughly resembles\nthe human reading comprehension process: after browsing the ar-\nticle and the question, the reader will refer back to the relevant\npieces in the original article to come up with answers.\nWe present background on document re-ranking results and outperform\nseveral top leaderboard systems.\n5.3 Ablation: Number of Input Chunks\nIn this section, we consider an ablation study where we input\nsmaller numbers of chunks to MORES+. Ideally, as the number of\nchunks increases, a good model should be able to pick up more in-\nformation and generate better final relevance judgments. It should\nnot be confused by extra noise in the input if the added chunks\nare not relevant. On the other hand, even with less sufficient in-\nformation, the model should not fail catastrophically but retain a\ncertain level of performance. In practice, reducing the number of\ninput chunks can help lower the total computation amount. It helps\nlower search latency when search volume increases.\nIn Figure 1, we plot number of input chunks versus nDCG@20\non Robust04 and ClueWeb09 using description queries. Note here a\nspecial case is the single chunk situation, where MORES+ reduces\nto the original MORES system. This corresponds to the left-most\ndata point in each plot. Here, MORES+ shows monotonic improve-\nments with respect to the number of input chunks while remaining\ndecently effective with a lower number of chunks.\nnDCG@20\n0.600.610.620.630.640.65\n1 2 3(a) Robust04 performance measured with nDCG@20.\nnDCG@20\n0.300.310.320.330.340.35\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n(b) ClueWeb09 performance measured with nDCG@20.\nFigure 1: Effect of changing number of input chunks to\nMORES+.

These dense retrieval\nmodels rely on the availability of large-scale training data, which\nincludes public datasets such as MS MARCO [ 3], and proprietary\ndatasets collected from the query logs of deployed search engines.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

An approach\nto address this sparsity issue is to train dense retrieval models\nusing knowledge distillation . Recent work [ 9\u201311,16,26] has shown\nthat the performance of dense retrieval models (i.e., the student\nmodels ) can be improved by distilling ranking knowledge from\na more expensive re-ranking model (i.e., the teacher model ) that\nlearns representations based on the interactions between query and\ndocument terms using cross-encoders [21, 24].\nIn the knowledge distillation setting, an available teacher model\nassigns a distinct score to a query-document pair on which the\nsupervision signal for optimizing the dense retrieval student model\nis based. Since the teacher can effectively score all pairs of queries\nand documents, we are not limited by the availability of labeled\ndata, thereby providing us with greater flexibility. In this paper,\nwe take advantage of this flexibility and introduce a generic cur-\nriculum learning framework for training dense retrieval models via\nknowledge distillation. The core idea of the curriculum learning\n(CL) is to provide a systematic approach to decompose the complex\nknowledge and design a curriculum for learning concepts from\nsimple to hard [ 8,15,31]. Motivated by curriculum learning\u2019s abil-\nity to find better local optima [ 1], we propose a framework called\nCL-DRD that introduces an iterative optimization process in which\nthe difficulty level of the training data produced using the teacher\nmodel, as made available to the student, increases at every iteration.\nThrough this CL-DRD process, we first demand the dense retrieval\nstudent model to recover coarse-grained distinctions between the\ndocuments exampled by the teacher model and then progressively\nmove towards recovering finer-grained ordering of documents. For\nrobust iterative optimization of the dense retrieval models, we adapt\nthe listwise loss function of LambdaRank [ 2] to our knowledge dis-\ntillation setting. Therefore, our loss function only focuses on the\norder of documents produced by the teacher model, and not the\nexact document scores.\nIn our Background\n2.1.1 Dense Retrieval. This paper focuses on the task of retriev-\ning items based on high-dimensional dense learned representations\nfor queries and documents, which is often called dense retrieval .\nThe query and document representations in dense retrieval models\nare often obtained using large-scale", " INTRODUCTION\nThe embedding based retrieval (EBR) of documents plays an im-\nportant role in many web applications, such as search engines\nand recommender systems [ 5,12,17,23]: given an input query,\nthe relevant documents are selected from the entire corpus based\non embedding similarity. Knowing that brute-force linear scan is\ntemporally infeasible, the embeddings need to be organized by\nANN index in order to support real-world information retrieval.\nFor the past decade, the vector quantization (VQ) techniques, e.g.,\nInverted File System (IVF) [ 1,2,19] and Product Quantization (PQ)\n[18,40,45], are widely applied, which enables ANN to be performed\nwith competitive time and memory efficiency.\n\u2022Typical learning paradigms of VQ . VQ is typically learned\nto minimize the reconstruction loss, i.e., the minimization of distor-\ntions (e.g.,\ud835\udc592 distance) between the original dense embeddings and\nthe reconstructed embeddings from quantization. Unfortunately,\nsuch an operation is inconsistent with the goal of retrieving ground-\ntruth documents for the query, which may cause severe loss of\nretrieval performance. In recent works [ 45,50], the dense embed-\ndings and VQ are jointly learned to minimize the post-quantization\nretrieval loss. However, the existing discussion of this paper.We perform comprehensive explorations for the optimal conduct\nof knowledge distillation, including the document sampling strate-\ngies (i.e., which documents to distill the teachers\u2019 knowledge), and\nthe function to preserve teachers and students\u2019 similarity (which\ndefines how to distill teachers\u2019 knowledge from their predictions to\nthe sampled documents). It is found that distilling knowledge from\na sufficient large number of Top-K documents (the Top-K relevant\ndocuments to each query predicted by the teachers) with functions\nenforcing ranking order invariance, e.g., ListNet [ 4], may produce\nthe most effective training outcome. Our evaluations are performed\non two large-scale benchmarks: MS MARCO and Natural Ques-\ntions, where Distill-VQ outperforms the SOTA vector quantization results in better efficiency-recall trade-off as com-\npared with the original IVFPQ in FAISS library.\n5 EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Experiment Settings\n4.1.1 Datasets. Our experimental studies are based on the two\npopular benchmarks on document retrieval. The first one is the MS\nMARCO (passage retrieval) [32]3. It is a widely used benchmark\non web search and embedding-based retrieval, where the targeted\nanswers from MS MARCO corpus need to be retrieved for queries\nfrom Bing search. The second one is the Natural Questions (NQ)\n[25]. The queries are real-world questions collected from Google\nSearch; each of the queries is paired with an answer span and\nground-truth passages from the Wikipedia pages. The detailed\nspecifications of the datasets are shown as Table 1. For both datasets,\nwe expect the ground-truth answer to each query can be retrieved\nfrom the entire corpus. Therefore, the experiment performances will\nbe measured by the recall rate for the top-K retrieval result. Besides,\nwe\u2019ll also report MRR@10 for more comprehensive evaluation.\n4.1.2 Baseline experiments, analyses, and improvement.

We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", " Introduction to information retrieval .\nCambridge university press, 2008. 2\nYu Meng, Chenyan Xiong, Payal Bajaj, Saurabh Tiwary, Paul Bennett, Jiawei Han, and Xia Song.

In this setup, queries\nand documents are encoded separately into a shared\n\ufb01xed-dimensional embedding space where relevant\nqueries and documents are represented in each\nother\u2019s proximity. Then, approximated nearest\nneighbor search (Vanderkam et al., 2013; John-\nson et al., 2021) is applied to ef\ufb01ciently retrieve\nrelevant documents given an encoded input query.\nWhile dual encoders are popular neural retriev-\ners, the expressiveness of the model is limited by\na bottleneck layer consisting of only a simple dot-\nproduct between query embeddings and passage\n1All the GTR models are released at https://tfhub.\ndev/google/collections/gtr/1 .\nFigure 1: The average Recall@100 and NDCG@100\non all BEIR tasks excluding MS Marco.

Several papers (Lu et al., 2021; Khat-\ntab and Zaharia, 2020) have discussed that the sim-\nple dot-product (or cosine similarity) between the\nembeddings might not be powerful enough to cap-\nture semantic relevance. Thakur et al. (2021) stud-\nied whether the retriever models can generalize to\nother domains and conclude that dual encoder mod-\nels have \u201cissues for out-of-distribution data\u201d, and\nshowed that models with more interactions between\nqueries and documents have better generalization\nability.\nIn this paper, we challenge this belief by scaling\nup the dual encoder model size while keeping the\nbottleneck embedding size \ufb01xed. Note that scal-\ning up a dual encoder is different from scaling up\npretrained language models such as BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) because\nof the presence of the bottleneck layer. While in-\ncreasing the model size can greatly increase the\ncapacity of the model, for dual encoders, where the\nembedding size is \ufb01xed, the interactions between\nqueries and documents are still limited by a simple\ndot-product.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we take advan-\ntage of the existing T5 model architecture and\ncheckpoints, which allows us to build encodersarXiv:2112.07899v1  [cs.IR]  15 Dec 2021Passage Question Passage Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-base D_Emb (D=768) \nT5-base \nQuestion Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-large D_Emb (D=768) \nPassage Question Passage Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-3B D_Emb (D=768) \nQuestion Q_Emb (D=768) \nT5-11B D_Emb (D=768) T5-3B \nT5-11B T5-large Figure 2: Architecture of Generalizable T5-based dense Retrievers.

Following Ni\net al. (2021), we build dual encoders by taking\nthe encoder part of T5. For effectively using the\npower of large models, we collect roughly two bil-\nlion community question-answer pairs as generic\npre-training data. By combining pre-training us-\ning generic training data and \ufb01ne-tuning using MS\nMarco (Nguyen et al., 2016), we are able to train\nlarge-scale dual encoder retrieval models.

We also observe that the randomness\nacross different templates is similar to Section 2.\nThese \ufb01ndings suggest that Entropy-based probing\nis not sensitive to speci\ufb01c templates, as it consis-\ntently provides improvements for all cases.\nPerformant permutation selection is a safe op-\ntion for In-context Learning We \ufb01nd that for\nmodels that suffer from high prompt variance, our\nprompt selection process can show large improve-\nments \u2013 up to 30% relative improvement.

Challenging problems include open-domain\nquestion-answering [ 8], claim-veri\ufb01cation [ 60], duplicate question detection [ 78], and many more.\nTraditionally, retrieval has been dominated by lexical approaches like TF-IDF or BM25 [ 55]. How-\never, these approaches suffer from lexical gap [ 5] and are able to only retrieve documents containing\nkeywords present within the query. Further, lexical approaches treat queries and documents as\nbag-of-words by not taking word ordering into consideration.\nRecently, deep learning and in particular pre-trained Transformer models like BERT [ 12] have\nbecome popular in information retrieval [ 37]. These neural retrieval systems can be used in many\nfundamentally different ways to improve retrieval performance. We provide an brief overview of the\nsystems in Section 2.1. Many prior work train neural retrieval systems on large datasets like Natural\nQuestions (NQ) [ 34] (133k training examples) or MS MARCO [ 45] (533k training examples), which\nboth focus on passage retrieval given a question or short keyword-based query. In most prior work,\napproaches are afterward evaluated on the same dataset, where signi\ufb01cant performance gains over\nlexical approaches like BM25 are demonstrated [15, 31, 46].\nHowever, creating a large training corpus is often time-consuming and expensive and hence many\nretrieval systems are applied in a zero-shot setup , with no available training data to train the system.\n\u0003Contributions made prior to joining Amazon.\nPreprint.

Even more important, it is unclear how well different approaches, like sparse\nembeddings vs. dense embeddings, generalize to out-of-distribution data.\nIn this work, we present a novel robust and heterogeneous benchmark called BEIR (Benchmarking\nIR), comprising of 18 retrieval datasets for comparison and evaluation of model generalization. Prior\nretrieval benchmarks [ 19,50] have issues of a comparatively narrow evaluation focusing either only\non a single task, like question-answering, or on a certain domain. In BEIR , we focus on Diversity , we\ninclude nine different retrieval tasks: Fact checking, citation prediction, duplicate question retrieval,\nargument retrieval, news retrieval, question answering, tweet retrieval, bio-medical IR, and entity\nretrieval. Further, we include datasets from diverse text domains, datasets that cover broad topics (like\nWikipedia) and specialized topics (like COVID-19 publications), different text types (news articles vs.\nTweets), datasets of various sizes (3.6k - 15M documents), and datasets with different query lengths\n(average query length between 3 and 192 words) and document lengths (average document length\nbetween 11 and 635 words).\nWe use BEIR to evaluate ten diverse retrieval methods, as retrieved hits without lexical overlap are automatically\nassumed to be irrelevant, even though the hits might be relevant for a", " Introduction\nLanguage model (LM) pre-training has been very\neffective in learning text encoders that can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned for many downstream tasks (Peters et al.,\n2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Deep bidirectional\nTransformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) LMs\nlike BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) are the state-of-\nthe-art. Recent works \ufb01ne-tune the CLS token to\nencode input text sequence into a single vector rep-\nresentation (Lee et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2020;\nKarpukhin et al., 2020). The resulting model is\nreferred to as dense encoder or bi-encoder. Fine-\ntuning associates with vector similarities some\npractical semantics, e.g., textual similarity or rel-\nevance, and therefore the vectors can be used for\nef\ufb01cient text comparison or retrieval by inner prod-\nuct. Despite their ef\ufb01ciency, bi-encoders are hard\nto train. Even with suf\ufb01cient data, bi-encoders still\n1Code available at https://github.com/luyug/\nCondenserrequire carefully designed sophisticated methods rather than \ufb01ne-tuning (Houlsby\net al., 2019). In evaluation, they focus on using the\nlearned embedding as universal features for a wide\nrange of tasks (Conneau and Kiela, 2018). This pa-\nper considers task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning of the entire\nmodel and focuses on the target task performance.3 Method\nThis section discusses the motivation behind Con-\ndenser, its design, and its pre-training procedure.\n3.1 Preliminaries\nTransformer Encoder Many recent state-of-the-\nart deep LM adopts the architecture of Transformer\nencoder. It takes in a text sequence, embed it\nand pass it through a stack of Lself-attentive\nTransformer blocks. Formally, given input text\nx= [x1; x2; :::], we can write iteratively,\nh0=Embed (x) (1)\nhl=Transformer l(hl\u00001) (2)\nIntuitively, Transformer blocks re\ufb01ne each token\u2019s\nrepresentation conditioning on all tokens in the\nsequence to effectively embed them.\nTransformer LM Pre-training Many success-\nful Transformer Encoder LMs such as BERT are\ntrained with masked language model (MLM) task.\nMLM masks out a subset of input tokens and re-\nquires the model to predict them. For a masked\nout token xiat position i, its corresponding \ufb01nal\nrepresentation hL\niis used to predict the actual xi.\nTraining uses a cross-entropy loss,\nLmlm=X\ni2maskedCrossEntropy (WhL\ni; xi)(3)\nA special token, typically referred to as CLS is\nprepended and encoded with the rest of the text.\n[h0\ncls;h0] =Embed ([CLS;x]) (4)\n[hl\ncls;hl] =TFl([hl\u00001\ncls;hl\u00001]) (5)\nSome models train CLS explicitly during pre-\ntraining, notably BERT\u2019s next sentence predic-\ntion (NSP; Devlin et al. (2019)), while others im-\nplicitly (Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019).\n3.2 Issues with Transformer Encoder\nRecall in Transformers, all tokens, including the\nCLS, receive information of other tokens in the\nsequence only with attention. Attention patterns,\ntherefore, de\ufb01ne how effective CLS can aggregate\ninformation. To understand the attentive behaviors\nof CLS, we borrow analysis of BERT from Clark\net al. (2019): 1) in most middle layers, the CLS\ntoken has similar attention patterns as other text\ntokens and is not attended by other tokens, 2) until\nthe last layer, CLS has unique broad attention overthe entire sequence to perform NSP task. In other\nwords, the CLS token remains dormant in many\nmiddle layers and reactivates only in the last round\nof attention. We argue that an effective bi-encoder\nshould actively aggregate information of different\ngranularity from the entire sentence through all\nlayers, and this structure in standard pre-trained\nLM is not immediately ready for \ufb01ne-tuning. We\nwill verify this claim with results with Condenser show that struc-\ntural readiness is a fundamental property in easy-\nto-train bi-encoders. Our attention analysis re-\nveals both Condenser and task-speci\ufb01c pre-trained\nmodel establish structural readiness, suggesting\ntask-speci\ufb01c objective may not be necessary. Re-\nsearchers can use this \ufb01nding to guide the", " Introduction\nWidely used, bag-of-words (BOW) information re-\ntrieval (IR) systems such as BM25 rely on exact\nlexical match2between query and document terms.\nRecent study in neural IR takes a different approach\nand compute soft matching between all query and\ndocument terms to model complex matching.\nThe shift to soft matching in neural IR models\nattempts to address vocabulary mismatch problems,\nthat query and the relevant documents use differ-\nent terms, e.g. cat v.s. kitty, for the same con-\ncept (Huang et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2016; Xiong\net al., 2017). Later introduction of contextualiza-\ntion handles the issue of semantic mismatch, exact\nmatch system gains the capability of modeling com-\nplicated matching patterns that were not captured\nby classical systems.\nV ocabulary mismatch in COIL can also be\nlargely mitigated with a high-level CLS vector\nmatching. The full system performs on par with\nmore expensive and complex all-to-all match re-\ntrievers. The success of the full system also shows\nthat dense retrieval and COIL\u2019s exact token match-\ning give complementary effects, with COIL making\nup dense system\u2019s lost token level matching signals\nand dense solving the vocabulary mismatch proba-\nbly for COIL.With our COIL systems showing viable search\nlatency, we believe this paper makes a solid step\ntowards building next-generation index that stores\nsemantics. At the intersection of lexical and neural\nsystems, ef\ufb01cient algorithms proposed for both can\npush COIL towards real-world systems. Related Work\nLexical Retriever Classical IR systems rely on\nexact lexical match retrievers such as Boolean\nRetrieval, BM25 (Robertson and Walker, 1994)\nand statistical language models (Lafferty and Zhai,\n2001). This type of retrieval model can process\nqueries very quickly by organizing the documents\ninto inverted index, where each distinct term has\nan inverted list that stores information about docu-\nments it appears in. Nowadays, they are still widely\nused in production systems. However, these re-\ntrieval models fall short of matching related terms\n(vocabulary mismatch) or modeling context of the\nterms (semantic mismatch). Much early effort\nwas put into improving exact lexical match retriev-\ners, such as matching n-grams (Metzler and Croft,\n2005) or expanding queries with terms from related\ndocuments (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001). However,\nthese methods: document tokens in the collection\nneed to be stored in a single huge index and con-\nsidered at query time. Consequently, ColBERT is\nengineering and hardware demanding.\n3 Methodologies\nIn this section, we \ufb01rst provide some preliminaries\non exact lexical match systems. Then we discuss\nCOIL\u2019s contextualized exact match design and how\nits search index is organized.

In Proc.", " Introduction\nDeep learning results suggest\nthat while the ORCAS dataset could be one reason for the low correlation, there might be other reasons causing this\nreduced correlation, which we plan to explore as future work. Results and analysis\nSubmitted runs The TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track had 25 participating groups, with a total of 123 runs submit-\nted across both tasks.\nBased run submission surveys, we manually classify each run into one of three categories:\n\u2022nnlm: if the run employs large scale pre-trained neural language models, such as BERT [Devlin et al., 2018]\nor XLNet [Yang et al., 2019b]\n\u2022nn:if the run employs some form of neural network based approach\u2014 e.g., Duet [Mitra et al., 2017, Mitra and\nCraswell, 2019] or using word embeddings [Joulin et al., 2016]\u2014but does not fall into the \u201cnnlm\u201d category\n\u2022trad: if the run exclusively uses traditional IR Conclusion\nThe TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track has provided two large training datasets, for a document retrieval task and a\npassage retrieval task, generating two ad hoc test collections with good reusability. The main document and passage\ntraining datasets in 2020 were the same as those in 2019. In addition, as part of the 2020 track, we have also released\na large click dataset, the ORCAS dataset, which was generated using the logs of the Bing search engine.\nFor both tasks, in the presence of large training data, this year\u2019s non-neural network runs were outperformed by neural\nnetwork runs. While usage of the ORCAS dataset seems to help improve the performance of the systems, it was not\nnecessary to use ORCAS data to achieve the highest NDCG@10.\nWe compared reranking approaches to end-to-end retrieval approaches, and in this year\u2019s track there was not a huge\ndifference, with some runs performing well in both regimes. This is another result that would be interesting to track in\nfuture years, since we would expect that end-to-end retrieval should perform better if it can recall documents that are\nunavailable in a reranking subtask.\nThis year the number of runs submitted for both tasks have increased compared to last year. In particular, number of\nnon-neural runs have increased. Hence, test collections generated as part of this year\u2019s track may be more reusable\ncompared to last year since these test collections may be fairer towards evaluating the quality of unseen non-neural\nruns. We note that the number of \u201cnn\u201d runs also seems to be smaller this year. We will continue to encourage a variety\nof approaches in submission, to avoid converging too quickly on one type of run, and to diversify the judging pools.\nSimilar to last year, in this year\u2019s track we have two types of evaluation label for each task.

For text classi\ufb01ca-\ntion tasks, notable models include BERT (De-\nvlin et al., 2018), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019),\nand XLNet (Yang et al., 2019). For text genera-\ntion tasks, notable models include BART (Lewis\net al., 2019), T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), mT5 (Xue\net al., 2020), XLM (Lample and Conneau, 2019),\nGPT (Radford et al., 2018), and GPT-2 (Radford\net al., 2019). These models encapsulate rich infor-\nmation to facilitate a wide range of downstream\ntasks ranging from natural language understand-\ning to generation. These models can be adapted\nto many different tasks via \ufb01ne-tuning. GPT-\n3(Brown et al., 2020), however, can be adapted\nto many downstream tasks without \ufb01ne-tuning.\nGiven just a few in-context examples, GPT- 3is\nable to quickly pick up patterns and produce an-\nswers analogously both in terms of the answer\nstyle and content. Thus, GPT- 3may be considered\nas a pattern recognizer to perform in-context learn-\ning. People have just started trying to understand\nGPT-3from different perspectives.

Our work focuses on how\nto choose good in-context examples.\nRetrieval-based Text Generation There is a\nlong history of applying information retrieval in\ntext generation (Sumita and Hitoshi, 1991). It is\nvery related to the exemplar-based learning (J \u00a8akel\net al., 2008; Ziyadi et al., 2020). The central idea is\nto treat retrieved samples as exemplars/prototypes\nand perform some editings on them. Some repre-\nsentative applications in the \ufb01eld of deep learning\ninclude machine translation (Gu et al., 2018), sen-\ntiment transfer (Li et al., 2018; Guu et al., 2018),\nQA (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020),\ndialogue generation (Yan et al., 2016; Cai et al.,\n2018; Song et al., 2016; Pandey et al., 2018; We-\nston et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019), text summa-\nrization (Cao et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2019), data-\nto-text generation (Peng et", " INTRODUCTION\nFor text ranking tasks (specifically, ad hoc retrieval), a simple two-stage retrieve-then-rerank architecture has\nproven to be an effective and widely adopted approach [ 2,43]. Retrieval can be accomplished via keyword\nsearch, e.g., ranking with BM25 [ 47], or more recently, via approximate nearest-neighbor search on learned dense\nrepresentations [ 13,18,19,21,27,57]. Reranking is typically accomplished using pretrained transformers such as\nBERT [11] or one of its variants that have been fine-tuned with (query, relevant document) pairs [37].\nWe present a refinement of this general approach that has been empirically demonstrated to work well for\nmultiple ad hoc retrieval tasks in different domains. In contrast to most current approaches that build on encoder-\nonly pretrained transformers such as BERT [ 11], our approach instead relies on pretrained sequence-to-sequence\ntransformers within a multi-stage ranking architecture. In our case, we use T5 [ 45], but our approach can be\nextended to other sequence-to-sequence models such as BART [ 22] and Pegasus [ 63] as well. The key features of\nour approach are as follows:\n\u2022Document expansion using a sequence-to-sequence model to enrich keyword representations of texts from\nthe corpus prior to indexing (\u201cExpando\u201d); we\u2019ve also previously called this approach \u201cdoc2query\u201d.\n\u2022Initial keyword-based retrieval (also called first-stage retrieval or candidate generation) using standard\ninverted indexes.\n\u2022A two-stage reranking pipeline comprising a pointwise reranker (\u201cMono\u201d) followed by a pairwise reranker\n(\u201cDuo\u201d), both built on pretrained sequence-to-sequence models.\nThis combination, which we dub \u201cExpando-Mono-Duo\u201d has been empirically validated on a wide range of ad hoc\nretrieval tasks in different domains. Based on formal evaluations, our approach has achieved effectiveness at or\nnear the state of the art, sometimes in a completely zero-shot manner (i.e., without fine-tuning models on data\nfrom the target task). The generality of this approach, we believe, suggests that elevating it to a \u201cdesign pattern\u201d\nfor text ranking might be justified.\nIn this paper, we provide details about each aspect of the \u201cExpando-Mono-Duo\u201d design pattern, how the design\nis specifically instantiated for different tasks, and report experimental BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nWe assume the standard definition of ad hoc retrieval, where given a corpus of texts C, the goal of a ranking\nmodel is to return a top \ud835\udc58ranked list of texts from the corpus in response to an information need \ud835\udc5ethat maximizes\nsome metric of ranking quality such as nDCG or MRR. In this paper we use the terms ad hoc retrieval and ranking\ninterchangeably.\nThe basic idea behind multi-stage ranking architectures is to break ad hoc retrieval down into a series of\npipeline stages. Following an initial retrieval stage (also called candidate generation or first-stage retrieval), where\na bag-of-words query is typically issued against an inverted index, each subsequent stage reranks the list of\ncandidates passed along from the previous stage until the final top \ud835\udc58results are generated for consumption, e.g.,\nreturned to the user. Recognizing that the unit of retrieval might differ based on the task, per standard parlance in\nIR, we use document to refer to the text being retrieved in a generic sense, when in actuality it may be a passage\n(in the case of MS MARCO passage ranking) or some hybrid construction (in the case of our TREC-COVID experiments, we considered \ud835\udc581={0,10,20,30,40,50},\nwhere\ud835\udc581=0corresponds to using only monoT5-3B; in all cases, \ud835\udc580is set to", " Introduction\nFor well over half a century, solutions to the ad\nhocretrieval problem\u2014where the system\u2019s task\nis return a list of top ktexts from an arbitrarily\nlarge corpusCthat maximizes some metric of qual-\nity such as average precision or nDCG\u2014has been\ndominated by sparse vector representations, for\nexample, bag-of-words BM25. Even in modern\nmulti-stage ranking architectures, which take ad-\nvantage of large pretrained transformers such as\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2018), the models are de-\nployed as rerankers over initial candidates retrieved\nbased on sparse vector representations; this is some-\ntimes called \u201c\ufb01rst-stage retrieval\u201d. One well-known\nexample of this design is the BERT-based reranker\nof Nogueira and Cho (2019).\n\u0003Contributed equally.The standard reranker architecture, while effec-\ntive, exhibits high query latency, on the order of\nseconds per query (Hofst \u00a8atter and Hanbury, 2019;\nKhattab and Zaharia, 2020) because expensive neu-\nral inference must be applied at query time on\nquery\u2013document pairs. This design is known as a\ncross-encoder (Humeau et al., 2020), and it exploits\nquery\u2013document attention interactions across all\ntransformer layers. As an alternative, the \ufb01eld has\nseen much recent interest in approaches based on\nrepresentation learning that allow document rep-\nresentations to be precomputed independently of\nqueries and stored. Ef\ufb01cient libraries then allow\nlarge-scale comparisons between query and doc-\nument vectors. Overall, such approaches are less\neffective than cross-encoder reranking models, but\nfar more ef\ufb01cient.\nWithin this general framework, we describe our\nlow latency end-to-end approach for the ad hoc pas-\nsage retrieval task that combines dense and sparse\nrepresentations. As a starting point, we adopt the\n\u201clate interaction\u201d ColBERT model (Khattab and Za-\nharia, 2020) and, via knowledge distillation (Hin-\nton et al., 2015), are able to simplify its MaxSim\nrelevance computation into dot-product similarity\nover pooled embeddings. Since lexical signals (e.g.,\nterm frequencies) from sparse representations re-\nmain essential for ad hoc retrieval (Karpukhin et al.,\n2020; Luan et al., 2020), we further demonstrate\nthat our dense representations can simply incorpo-\nrate sparse signals without a complex joint training\nstrategy (Gao et al., 2020). In sum, we introduce\nsimple-yet-effective strategies that leverage both\ndense and sparse representations for the end-to-end\nad hoc passage retrieval task.\nOur key insight is that during distillation, tight\ncoupling between the teacher model and the stu-\ndent model enables more \ufb02exible distillation strate-\ngies and yields better learned representations (illus-\ntrated in Figure 1). By tight coupling, we mean thatarXiv:2010.11386v1  [cs.IR]  22 Oct 20200.800.010.020.100.040.030.030.700.010.050.200.010.010.010.900.020.010.05Query EncoderDoc Encoderq0\nPooldPoolqq1q2\nq0q1q2d+q0d\u2212q0d+q1d\u2212q1d+q2d\u2212q2d+q0d\u2212q0d+q1d\u2212q1d+q2d\u2212q2\nQuery EncoderDoc EncoderMaxSimMaxSim\u2211X\nBatch tripletsSoft labelsHard labelsTeacherStudent100000010000001000q0q1q2d+q0d\u2212q0d+q1d\u2212q1d+q2d\u2212q2Figure 1: Tight coupling between teacher and student\nmodels during distillation of dense representations for\nranking.\ninference using the teacher model is interleaved\ndirectly during the distillation process: This is a\nkey difference between our approach and previous methods such as impor-\ntance sampling beyond uniform in-batch subsam-\npling can be incorporated with our tightly-coupled\nteacher method, which we leave for future work.\n6 Background\nWe begin by formalizing the representation learn-\ning problem for text ranking and review learning\napproaches.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the \ufb01rst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy.\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], \ufb01nd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1),", " Introduction\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-\nedge from data [ 47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\nimplicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can\u2019t straightforwardly provide insight into\ntheir predictions, and may produce \u201challucinations\u201d [ 38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [ 20,26,48] can address some of these\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\ninspected and interpreted.

Consequently, traditional\nretrieval approaches often perform poorly at passage retrieval.

However, these approaches have a substantial\ncomputational burden, which can make them impractical [7, 14].\nWe propose a new approach for passage retrieval that performs\nmodeling of term importance (i.e., salience) and expansion over a\ncontextualized language model to build query and document repre-\nsentations. We call this approach EPIC (Expansion via Prediction\nof Importance with Contextualization). At query time, EPIC can be\nemployed as an inexpensive re-ranking method because document\nrepresentations can be pre-computed at index time. EPIC improves\nupon the prior state of the art on the MS-MARCO passage ranking\ndataset by substantially narrowing the effectiveness gap between\npractical approaches with subsecond retrieval times and those that\nare considerably more expensive, e.g., those using BERT as a re-\nranker. Furthermore, the proposed representations are interpretable\nbecause the dimensions of the representation directly correspond\nto the terms in the lexicon. An overview is shown in Fig. 1.\nNeural re-ranking approaches can generally be characterized as\neither representation-based or interaction-based [ 5]. Representation-\nbased models, like ours, build representations of a query and pas-\nsage independently and then compare these representations to\ncalculate a relevance score. These are beneficial because one can\ncompute document representations at index time to reduce the\nquery-time cost. Interaction-based models combine signals from\nthe query and the document at query time to compute the relevance\nscore [ 13]. The Duet model [ 12] aims to achieve low query-time\nlatency by combining signals from both a representation-based\nand an interaction-based model. However, this approach substan-\ntially under-performs the latest pure interaction-based approaches\nsuch as the one in [ 13]. TK [ 8] attempts to bridge this performance\ngap by using a smaller transformer network, but still utilizes an\ninteraction-based approach which itself adds considerable compu-\ntational overhead. Finally, other interesting proposals have inves-\ntigated alternative approaches for offloading computational cost\nto index time. Doc2query [ 15] and docTTTTTquery [ 14] add im-\nportant context to otherwise short documents by using a sequence-\nto-sequence model to predict additional terms to add to the docu-\nment.

The 100 were retrieved using Indri [Strohman et al., 2005] on the full corpus with Krovetz\nstemming and stopwords eliminated. Participants were expected to rerank the candidates w.r.t. their estimated rel-\nevance to the query. This is a common scenario in many real-world retrieval systems that employ a telescoping\narchitecture [Matveeva et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2011]. The reranking subtask allows participants to focus on learning\nan effective relevance estimator, without the need for implementing an end-to-end retrieval system. It also makes the\nreranking runs more comparable, because they all rerank the same set of 100 candidates.\nFor judging, NIST\u2019s pooling was across both subtasks, and they also identi\ufb01ed additional documents for judging\nvia classi\ufb01er. Further, for queries with many relevant documents, additional documents were judged. These steps\nwere carried out to identify a suf\ufb01ciently comprehensive set of relevant Results and analysis\nSubmitted runs A total of 15 groups participated in the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track, with an aggregate of 75\nruns submitted across both tasks.\nBased run submission surveys, we classify each run into one of three categories:\n\u000fnnlm: if the run employs large scale pre-trained neural language models, such as BERT [Devlin et al., 2018]\nor XLNet [Yang et al., 2019b]\n\u000fnn:if the run employs some form of neural network based approach\u2014 e.g., Duet [Mitra et al., 2017, Mitra and\nCraswell, 2019] or using word embeddings [Joulin et al., 2016]\u2014but does not fall into the \u201cnnlm\u201d category\n\u000ftrad: if the run exclusively uses traditional IR experiments?

For both tasks, in the presence\nof large training data, this year\u2019s non-neural network runs were outperformed by neural network runs. Among the\nneural approaches, the best-performing runs tended to use transfer learning, employing a pretrained language model\nsuch as BERT.

Applied to the document ranking problem i n information retrieval\u2014where given\na query, the system\u2019s task is to return a ranked list of docume nts from a large corpus that maximizes\nsome ranking metric such as average precision or nDCG\u2014the si mplest formulation is to deploy a\nclassi\ufb01er that estimates the probability each document bel ongs to the \u201crelevant\u201d class, and then sort\nall the candidates by these estimates.\nDeep transformer models pretrained with language modeling objectives, exempli\ufb01ed by BERT [3],\nhave proven highly effective in a variety of classi\ufb01cation a nd sequence labeling tasks in NLP.\nNogueira and Cho [9] were the \ufb01rst to demonstrate its effecti veness in ranking tasks. Since it is\nimpractical to apply inference to every document in a corpus with respect to a query, these tech-\nniques are typically applied to rerank a list of candidates. In a typical end-to-end system, these\ncandidates are from the experiments, where we demonstrate that the model is indeed exploiting knowl-\nedge from its ability to generate \ufb02uent natural language tex t.

Typically the first stage\nranker is a Boolean, probabilistic, or vector space bag-of-words\nretrieval model that fetches information from an inverted index.\nOne key characteristic of first-stage ranking algorithms is how they\nquantify the contribution of each query or document term.

These experiments that investigated\nfirst-stage search accuracy using DeepCT-Index indexes, and why\nDeepCTIndex term weights are effective.\n5.1 Retrieval Accuracy of DeepCT-Index\nThis section examines whether DeepCT-Index improves first-stage\nretrieval accuracy over baseline term weighting related work. Section 3 describes the Deep\nContextualized Term Weighting framework ( DeepCT ), its use for\npassage indexing ( DeepCT-Index ), and its use for for query weight-\ning (DeepCT-Query ). Sections 5-6 describe our methodologies and RELATED WORK\nTwo types of work are related: term weighting, and neural ap-\nproaches for early-stage ranking.\nTerm Weighting. Bag-of-words retrieval models such as BM25\n[26] and query likelihood [ 17] are the foundation of modern search\nengines due to their efficiency and effectiveness. Most retrieval\nmodels use frequency-based signals such as tf,ctf, and dfto estimate\nhow well each term represents a text (query, document). A rich\nresearch literature studies how to better estimate term importance\n(e.g., [ 2,3,5,18,27,36]), however frequency-based signals continue\nto dominate in both industry and academia.\n2We have released software and data: https://github.com/AdeDZY/DeepCTFor document term weighting, the most widely-used alternatives\nto frequency-based models are graph-based results show that DeepCT-Index improves the ac-\ncuracy of two popular first-stage retrieval algorithms by up to 50%.\nRunning BM25 onDeepCT-Index can be as effective as several previ-\nous state-of-the-art multi-stage search systems that use knowledge\nbases, machine learning, and large amounts of training data.\nThe higher-quality ranking enabled by DeepCT-Index improves\nthe accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for later-stage re-rankers. A state-\nof-the-art BERT-based re-ranker achieved similar accuracy with 5\u00d7\nfewer candidate documents, making such computation-intensive\nre-rankers more practical in latency-/resource-sensitive systems.\nAlthough much progress has been made toward developing bet-\nter neural ranking models for IR, computational complexity often\nlimits these models to the re-ranking stage. DeepCT successfully\ntransfers the text understanding ability from a deep neural network\ninto simple signals that can be efficiently consumed by early-stage\nranking systems and boost their performance.\nAnalysis shows the main advantage of DeepCT over classic term-\nweighting approaches: DeepCT finds the most central words in a\ntext even if they are mentioned only once. Non-central words, even\nif mentioned frequently in the text, are suppressed. Such behavior\nis uncommon in previous term weighting approaches. We view\nDeepCT as an encouraging step from \u201cfrequencies\u201d to \u201c meanings\u201d. RESULTS FOR DeepCT-Query\nThis section presents the experimental methodology and Results are listed in Table 6. The short title queries did\nnot benefit from the term weighting approaches. Title queries often\nconsist of a few keywords that are all essential, so re-weighting\nis less important. Besides, there isn\u2019t much context for DeepCT to\nleverage to estimate term importance. External information about\nthe query, such as pseudo-relevance feedback [ 16], may be neces-\nsary to understand short queries.\nDescription and narrative queries mention many terms and\nconcepts; it is", " introduction\nof large-scale datasets, such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016),\nSearchQA (Dunn et al., 2017), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and QUASAR-T (Dhingra et al., 2017),\nand the broad adoption of neural models, such as BiDAF (Seo et al., 2016), DrQA (Chen et al.,\n2017), DocumentQA (Clark & Gardner, 2017), and QAnet (Yu et al., 2018).\nThe information retrieval (IR) community has also experienced a \ufb02ourishing development of neural\nranking models, such as DRMM (Guo et al., 2016), KNRM (Xiong et al., 2017), Co-PACRR (Hui\net al., 2018), and DUET (Mitra et al., 2017). However, until recently, there were only a few large\ndatasets for passage ranking, with the notable exception of the TREC-CAR (Dietz et al., 2017).\nThis, at least in part, prevented the neural ranking models from being successful when compared to\nmore classical IR techniques (Lin, 2019).\nWe argue that the same two ingredients that made possible much progress on the reading compre-\nhension task are now available for passage ranking task. Namely, the MS MARCO passage ranking\ndataset, which contains one million queries from real users and their respective relevant passages\nannotated by humans, and BERT, a powerful general purpose natural language processing model.\nIn this paper, we describe in detail how we have re-purposed BERT as a passage re-ranker and\nachieved state-of-the-art experiments publicly available.

Reusable test collections and off-line evaluation mea-\nsures [ 7] have been the dominating paradigm for experimentally\nvalidating IR research for the last 30 years. The popularity and\nubiquity of off-line IR evaluation measures is partly due to the Text\nREtrieval Conference (TREC) [ 5]. TREC led to the development\nof the trec_eval1software package that is the standard tool for\nevaluating a collection of rankings. The trec_eval tool allows IR re-\nsearchers to easily compute a large number of evaluation measures\nusing standardized input and output formats. For a document col-\nlection, a test collection of queries with query/document relevance\ninformation (i.e., qrel ) and a set of rankings generated by a par-\nticular IR system (i.e., a system run) for the test collection queries,\n\u2217Open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval.\n1https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

The adoption of trec_eval as an integral\npart of IR research has led to the following benefits: (a) standardized\nformats for system rankings and query relevance information such\nthat different research groups can exchange experimental RESULTS\nAs demonstrated above, pytrec_eval conveniently exposes pop-\nular IR evaluation measures within Python. However, the same\nfunctionality could be exposed by invoking trec_eval in a serialize-\ninvoke-parse workflow\u2014or\u2014by implementing the evaluation mea-\nsure natively in Python. In this section we provide empirical bench-\nmark methods are equally fast. When invoking trec_eval us-\ning the serialize-invoke-parse workflow, rankings are written from\nPython to storage without sorting, as trec_eval itself sorts the\nrankings internally. The resulting evaluation output is read from\nstdout to a Python string and we do not extract the measure val-\nues, as different parsing strategies can lead to large variance in\nruntime. For the native Python implementation, we experimented\nwith different open-source implementations of the NDCG measure\nand adapted the fastest implementation as our baseline. The imple-\nmentation does not make use of NumPy or other scientific Python\nlibraries as (a) we wish to compare to native Python directly and\n(b) the NumPy-based implementations we experimented with were\nless efficient than the native implementation we settled with, as\nNumPy-based implementations require that the rankings are en-\ncoded in dense arrays before computing evaluation measures. The\nevaluated rankings and ground-truth were synthesized by assign-\ning every document a distinct ranking score in Nand a relevance\nlevel of 1. This allows us to evaluate different evaluation measure\nimplementations with rankings and query sets of different sizes. Experiments were run using a single Intel Xeon CPU (E5-2630 v3)\nclocked at 2.4GHz, DDR4 RAM clocked at 2.4GHz, an Intel SSD (DC\nS3610)", " Introduction\nBuilding intelligent agents with machine reading comprehension (MRC) or open-domain question\nanswering (QA) capabilities using real world data is an important goal of arti\ufb01cial intelligence.\nProgress in developing these capabilities can be of signi\ufb01cant consumer value if employed in\nautomated assistants\u2014 e.g., Cortana [Cortana], Siri [Siri], Alexa [Amazon Alexa], or Google Assistant\n[Google Assistant]\u2014on mobile devices and smart speakers, such as Amazon Echo [Amazon Echo].\nMany of these devices rely heavily on recent advances in speech recognition technology powered by\nneural models with deep architectures [Hinton et al., 2012, Dahl et al., 2012]. The rising popularity\nof spoken interfaces makes it more attractive for users to use natural language dialog for question-\nanswering and information retrieval from the web as opposed to viewing traditional search result\npages on a web browser [Gao et al., 2018]. Chatbots and other messenger based intelligent agents are\nalso becoming popular in automating business processes\u2014 e.g., answering customer service requests.\nAll of these scenarios can bene\ufb01t from fundamental improvements in MRC models. However,\nMRC in the wild is extremely challenging. Successful MRC systems should be able to learn good\nrepresentations from raw text, infer and reason over learned representations, and \ufb01nally generate a\nsummarized response that is correct in both form and content.\nThe public availability of large datasets has been instrumental in many AI research breakthroughs\n[Wissner-Gross, 2016]. For example, ImageNet\u2019s [Deng et al., 2009] release of 1.5 million labeled\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.arXiv:1611.09268v3  [cs.CL]  31 Oct 2018examples with 1000 object categories led to the development of object classi\ufb01cation models that\nperform better than humans on the ImageNet task [He et al., 2015]. Similarly, the large speech\ndatabase collected over 20 years by DARPA enabled new breakthroughs in speech recognition\nperformance from deep learning models Deng and Huang [2004]. Several MRC and QA datasets\nhave also recently emerged. However, many of these existing datasets are not suf\ufb01ciently large\nto train deep neural models with large number of parameters. Large scale existing MRC datasets,\nwhen available, are often synthetic. Furthermore, a common characteristic, shared by many of these\ndatasets, is that the questions are usually generated by crowd workers based on provided text spans\nor documents. In MS MARCO, in contrast, the questions correspond to actual search queries that\nusers submitted to Bing, and therefore may be more representative of a \u201cnatural\u201d distribution of\ninformation need that users may want to satisfy using, say, an intelligent assistant.\nReal-world text is messy: they may include typos or abbreviations\u2014and transcription errors in case of\nspoken interfaces. The text from different documents may also often contain con\ufb02icting information.\nMost existing datasets, in contrast, often contain high-quality stories or text spans from sources such\nas Wikipedia. Real-world MRC systems should be benchmarked on realistic datasets where they\nneed to be robust to noisy and problematic inputs.\nFinally, another potential limitation of existing MRC tasks is that they often require the model to\noperate on a single entity or a text span. Under many real-world application settings, the information\nnecessary to answer a question may be spread across different parts of the same document, or even\nacross multiple documents. It is, therefore, important to test an MRC model on its ability to extract\ninformation and support for the \ufb01nal"]}

A robust guardrail framework not only improves user experience by ensuring that LLMs respond appropriately to emotional tones but also significantly contributes to the field of secure AI by addressing the growing concerns regarding adversarial attacks, such as jailbreak attempts. By integrating real-time sentiment analysis and federated learning, this research could lead to more adaptable and resilient models, fostering trust and safety in sensitive applications like mental health support, customer service, and education. The implications extend beyond theoretical advancements; practical applications of this framework could set new standards for responsible AI deployment, guiding future research directions toward more ethical and secure systems.\n\n[Question 3]: Why is it hard?  \nThe challenges involved in solving this problem are multifaceted. First, integrating linguistic statistical techniques with real-time sentiment analysis requires sophisticated natural language processing capabilities that can accurately interpret and respond to emotional nuances in user interactions. Second, the implementation of federated learning poses technical hurdles, as it necessitates the design of algorithms that can effectively learn from distributed data while preserving privacy. Naive approaches may fail because they might not adequately account for the complexity of human emotions, leading to inappropriate responses that could exacerbate user frustration or harm. Additionally, adversarial input detection is a challenging domain that requires robust algorithms capable of identifying and mitigating manipulative inputs in real time, which is essential for maintaining model integrity and ethical compliance.\n\n[Question 4]: Why hasn't it been solved before?  \nPrevious research has often focused on isolated components of LLM safety, such as input filtering or adversarial attack mitigation, without a holistic approach that combines these elements.

See full examples at[1, 2].\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have fueled their adoption into the products of numerous companies, including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered. Figure\u00a01 presents an illustration of real examples of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo leads the LLM to perform the task. The complete conversations are available at [1, 2].\n\n\nTo validate and assess Crescendo\u2019s effectiveness, we evaluate it against current state-of-the-art LLMs, ranging from open-source models like LLaMA-2 70b and LLaMA-3 70b to closed-source ones such as Gemini-Pro, Claude-2, Claude-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.\n\n\nIn this paper, we start by manually executing Crescendo on a subset of the tasks listed in Table\u00a01 against all models. Our findings confirm that Crescendo can indeed overcome the safety alignment of all models for nearly all tasks (Table\u00a02).\nMoreover, we show that once a multimodal model, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, is jailbroken using Crescendo, it can be used for different modality tasks, such as generating images that", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language generation and different downstream tasks\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023a; Team et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023).\nHowever, the potential for these models to produce biased or harmful outputs, especially when exposed to malicious prompts, remains a significant concern. Recent evaluations have highlighted these susceptibilities, revealing how LLMs can be harnessed to generate undesired contents\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2023a).\n\n\nExisting mitigation strategies, such as instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\u00a0(Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022a), though effective, often incur substantial computational costs and manual efforts. An alternative approach, which directly moderates both the inputs and outputs of LLMs, presents a more effective and efficient solution. Recent developments in this direction include both closed-source and open-source approaches, such as OpenAI content moderation API\u00a0(Markov et\u00a0al., 2023), Perspective API\u00a0(Lees et\u00a0al., 2022), Nemo Guardrails\u00a0(Rebedea et\u00a0al., 2023) and LlamaGuard\u00a0(Inan et\u00a0al., 2023). However, these solutions primarily rely on LLMs for detecting harmful contents, leaving them susceptible to jailbreaking attacks \u00a0(Zou et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Mehrotra et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nFigure 1: The overall framework of RigorLLM.\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose RigorLLM (Resilient Guardrails for large language models), a novel and multi-faceted framework for input/output content moderation for LLMs based on different levels of constrained optimizations on corresponding components, such as data generation and safe suffix optimization.\nIn particular, RigorLLM first generates harmful data for training the guardrails by formulating the harmful categories as different constraints based on Langevin dynamics\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022). It also constrains that the distance between the distributions of generated data and validation data is bounded. Then RigorLLM optimizes a safe suffix for input queries by solving a minimax optimization to defend against potential jailbreaking attacks. Finally, RigorLLM integrates a fusion-based guardrail model, combining the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm with LLMs, to detect both original and transformed prompts, yielding a comprehensive and reliable harmful content detection mechanism. The overall framework of RigorLLM is shown in Figure\u00a01.\n\n\nOur extensive experiments benchmark RigorLLM against state-of-the-art solutions such as OpenAI content moderation API\u00a0(Markov et\u00a0al., 2023), Perspective API\u00a0(Lees et\u00a0al., 2022), NeMo Guardrails\u00a0(Rebedea et\u00a0al., 2023), and LlamaGuard\u00a0(Inan et\u00a0al., 2023).\nWe demonstrate that RigorLLM not only surpasses these baselines in harmful content detection on various datasets but also exhibits superior resilience to jailbreaking attacks. For example, on the ToxicChat dataset, RigorLLM achieves an improvement of 23% in F1 score compared to the best baseline model.\nUnder jailbreaking attacks, RigorLLM maintains a 100% detection rate on harmful content with different adversarial strings, while other baselines exhibit significantly lower performance.\n\n\nAs the first resilient LLM guardrail framework, RigorLLM will inspire new solutions towards more resilient guardrails to perform input/output content moderation for LLMs under diverse jailbreaking attacks.\nOur technical contributions include:\n(1) We propose a novel constrained optimization framework for data generation based on Langevin dynamics, uniquely constraining the distributional distance between the generated data and original data from different harmful content categories. (2) We introduce a simple yet effective approach for enhancing the resilience of LLM guardrails by optimizing a safe suffix for input queries. (3) We analyze the robustness property of the KNN models and incorporate it into LLMs to form", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge Language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing and disrupting many fields of human endeavor; we are at the beginning of experiencing and understanding their impact\u00a0Tamkin et\u00a0al. (2021). They continue to develop at a breathtaking pace, in terms of scale and capabilities, but also architectures and applications. In addition, novel systems integrating LLMs, or employing multiple LLM agents are being created and integrated into more complex interdependent systems. As a result, it is essential to understand LLM security properties to guide the development of LLM-based systems that are secure and robust. In this paper, we survey and classify the threats posed by adversarial attacks to LLMs.\n\n\nWhat are Adversarial Attacks?\n\nAdversarial attacks are a known threat vector to machine learning algorithms. In these attacks, carefully manipulated inputs can drive a machine learning structure to produce reliably erroneous outputs to an attacker\u2019s advantage\u00a0Szegedy et\u00a0al. (2013); these perturbations can be very small, and imperceptible to human senses. Attacks can be targeted, seeking to change the output of the model to a specific class or text string, or untargeted, seeking only to result in an erroneous classification or generation. The attacks differ also in terms of the assumed attacker\u2019s access to the internal structure of the model. The adversarial attack problem has proven to be extremely difficult to mitigate in the context of traditional models, with new defenses proposed that prove to be of limited effectiveness against new attacks that adapt to them\u00a0Madry et\u00a0al. (2017); Ilyas et\u00a0al. (2019); Papernot et\u00a0al. (2016); Carlini and Wagner (2016).\n\n\n\nAdversarial attacks on LLMs and end-to-end attack scenarios.\n\nUnderstanding adversarial attacks in the context of LLMs poses a number of challenges. LLMs are complex models with new degrees of freedom: they are extremely large; they are generative; they maintain context; they are often multi-modal; and they are being integrated within complex eco-systems (e.g., as interacting LLM agents\u00a0Topsakal and Akinci (2023) or autonomous systems grounded on LLMs\u00a0Ahn et\u00a0al. (2022); Shah et\u00a0al. (2023)). As a result, the threat of adversarial attacks manifests differently and requires careful analysis to define threat models and to guide the development of principled defenses.\n\n\nWe illustrate the danger posed by adversarial attacks on LLMs using the following motivating examples.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nAlice attempts to obtain harmful information about how to build a bomb from an LLM. The model has been fine-tuned/aligned to prevent it from giving users harmful information; however, Alice manipulates the prompt and is able to get the model to provide this information, bypassing its safety mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nBob uses an LLM extension integrated with their browser as a shopping assistant. Charlie, a malicious seller, embeds adversarial information either in text or images of their product page to contaminate the context of the shopping extension, making it more likely to recommend the product.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDana is using an LLM augmented programming assistant to help write code. An adversarial example she accidentally provides causes the LLM to generate code with a malicious backdoor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope of the survey.\n\nIn this survey, we review and organize recent work on adversarial attacks on LLMs. We focus on classes of adversarial attacks that are general across domains and models, that always need to be", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe rapid development of large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT\u00a0(OpenAI, 2022), Bard\u00a0(Google, 2023), and Claude\u00a0(Google, 2023), has enabled conversational AI systems with human-like capabilities. Recently, several open-source LLMs have been released which make such AI systems more accessible, affordable, and available for more researchers to advance the state-of-the-art\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023a; Chiang et\u00a0al., 2023; Almazrouei et\u00a0al., 2023; MosaicML, 2023; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b). However, there is growing concern that open-source LLMs are more amenable to the dissemination of harmful or unethical content\u00a0(Hazell, 2023; Kang et\u00a0al., 2023). In response to this challenge, LLM providers have implemented a range of training techniques aimed at \u201caligning\u201d these models with human values before releasing them\u00a0(Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022a; Korbak et\u00a0al., 2023; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2023). These efforts are often complemented by red teaming, a team of evaluators who proactively identify and prevent failures of LLM alignments\u00a0(Perez et\u00a0al., 2022; Ganguli et\u00a0al., 2022; Casper et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nHowever, even with these alignment techniques, open-source LLMs still remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Alarmingly, recent work demonstrates jailbreaks \u00a0(Bai et\u00a0al., 2022b; Albert, 2023), using specifically crafted inputs to successfully bypass the alignment methods. Further work demonstrates it is possible to automatically discover such inputs, known as adversarial prompts\u00a0(Wen et\u00a0al., 2023; Jones et\u00a0al., 2023; Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023; Zou et\u00a0al., 2023; Shen et\u00a0al., 2023). Recently, Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) successfully found adversarial prompts that can transfer across multiple LLMs, including proprietary, black-box models. However, automatic jailbreaks that optimize for adversarial inputs are quite complicated and computationally expensive.\n\n\\includegraphics\n[width=]figures/teaser.pdf\nFigure 1: Responses to a malicious instruction by the LLaMA2-7B-chat model under different generation configurations. In this example, we simply changed p\ud835\udc5dpitalic_p from 0.9 (default) to 0.75 in top-p\ud835\udc5dpitalic_p sampling, which successfully bypasses the safety constraint.\n\n\nIn this work, we take an extremely simple approach to jailbreaking the alignment of LLMs, focusing on open-source models that underwent safety tuning before their release.\nUnlike adversarial-prompt techniques, we only manipulate text generation configurations (Figure\u00a01), by removing the system prompt, a guideline intentionally prepended to steer model generation, and by varying decoding hyper-parameters or sampling methods. Our key hypothesis is that existing alignment procedures and evaluations are likely based on a default decoding setting, which may exhibit vulnerability when the configurations are slightly varied, as we observed extensively in our experiments. We call our approach the generation exploitation attack, an alternative solution to disrupt the alignment of LLMs without requiring any sophisticated methods.\n\n\nTo systematically evaluate our findings, we evaluate our generation exploitation attack on\n11 open-source LLMs spanning four different model families (Section\u00a04.2), including LLaMA2\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b), Vicuna\u00a0(Chiang et\u00a0al., 2023), Falcon\u00a0(Almazrouei et\u00a0al., 2023), and MPT models\u00a0(MosaicML, 2023).\nIn addition to evaluating on a recent benchmark\u00a0\ud835\udda0\ud835\uddbd\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udda1\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc1\ud835\udda0\ud835\uddbd\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udda1\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc1\\mathsf{AdvBench}sansserif_AdvBench\u00a0(Zou et\u00a0al., 2023), we also curate new benchmark\u00a0\ud835\uddac\ud835\uddba\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddcc\ud835\udda8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcc\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddcb\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddac\ud835\uddba\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddcc\ud835\udda8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcc\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddcb\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddcd\\mathsf{MaliciousInstruct}sansserif_MaliciousInstruct, which covers a broader spectrum of malicious intents to increase the diversity of scenarios considered. We also developed a more robust evaluation procedure based on a trained classifier for detecting malicious outputs, with a significantly higher human agreement compared to previous metrics based on simple string matching (Section\u00a03).\n\n\nOur experimental results show that our generation exploitation attack can increase the misalignment rate to >95%absentpercent95>95\\%> 95 % for 9 out of 11 models.

This is because ChatGPT will sometimes not paraphrase a\nharmful prompt because it detects the malevolence of the prompt instead of returning a canonical\nabstained response of \u201cI am sorry ...\u201d. This phenomenon portrays a potential second benefit of the\nparaphrase defense.

However, this does not stop the", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm, showing their ability to generate high-quality text for various tasks like storytelling, serving as chat assistants, and even composing music [agostinelli2023musiclm, huang2023audiogpt].\nRecent research has also explored how LLMs can interact with each other to enhance performance on tasks such as coding, mathematics, and question answering [wu2023autogen, josifoski2023flows]\nHowever, despite their abilities to produce positive content, LLMs can also generate harmful material like phishing emails, malicious code, and hate speech [gupta2023chatgpt, wei2023jailbroken].\nMany methods attempt to prevent the generation of harmful content. These methods mainly focus on \u201caligning\u201d LLMs to human values using various training strategies [ouyang2022training, glaese2022improving] or by providing a set of supervisory principles to guide the LLM\u2019s responses [bai2022constitutional]. However, an emerging body of work has revealed that even aligned models can be manipulated into producing harmful content by prompt engineering [wei2023jailbroken, qiu2023latent, liu2023jailbreaking], or employing more advanced techniques such as adversarial suffix attacks [wei2023jailbroken, zou2023universal, carlini2023aligned].\nThe challenge of preventing an LLM from generating harmful content lies in the fact that this conflicts with how they are trained [brown2020language]. The very framework that allows LLMs to effectively generate high-quality responses also enables them to generate hateful or otherwise harmful text, as the training corpora are composed of public data containing toxic passages [luccioni2021s]. Our work helps tackle these critical challenges through the following major contributions:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nLLM Self Defense: a simple zero-shot defense against LLM attacks (Fig. 1). LLM Self Defense is a method designed to prevent user exposure to harmful or malevolent content induced from LLMs. It is effective and easy to deploy, requiring no modifications to the underlying model. LLM Self Defense is relatively simple when compared to existing methods of defending against LLM attacks, as existing methods rely on iterative generation or preprocessing [jain2023baseline, li2023rain]. Thus, LLM Self Defense is faster and more efficient. (Section\u00a03)\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nLLM Self Defense reduces attack success rate to virtually 0. We evaluated LLM Self Defense on two prominent language models: GPT\u00a03.5 [chatgpt2022], one of the most popular LLMs [touvron2023llama], and Llama\u00a02, a prominent open-source LLM. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM Self Defense generalizes effectively across both models, flagging nearly all harmful text and reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 against a variety of attack types, including those aimed at eliciting affirmative responses, and prompt engineering attacks.\nNotably, we observed that LLMs perform better in identifying harmful content when they are tasked with detecting harm as a suffix, after the LLM already processed the text (Fig.\u00a02). Our findings demonstrate that presenting the harmful text first is more effective in minimizing false alarms.\n(Section\u00a04)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/poloclub/llm-self-defense\n\n \n\n2 Related Work\n\n\n2.1 Adversarial attacks on LLMs\n\nAs LLMs have grown in complexity and capability, so has their attack surface [greshake2302not]. Recently researchers have explored LLM attacks or \u201cjailbreaking\u201d, methods to bypass or break through the limitations imposed on LLMs that prevent them from generating harmful content. Wei, et al. [wei2023jailbroken] argued that there exists a conflict between generating highly probable sequences of text, aligning with the core pretraining auto-regressive objective of LLMs [vaswani2017attention], and avoiding the generation", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Aligned LLMs are not adversarially aligned. Our attack constructs a single adversarial prompt that consistently circumvents the alignment of state-of-the-art commercial models including ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and Llama-2 without having direct access to them. The examples shown here are all actual outputs of these systems. The adversarial prompt can elicit arbitrary harmful behaviors from these models with high probability, demonstrating potentials for misuse. To achieve this, our attack (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) finds such universal and transferable prompts by optimizing against multiple smaller open-source LLMs for multiple harmful behaviors. These are further discussed in Section\u00a03 and the complete unabridged transcripts are provided in Appendix\u00a0B.\n\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are typically trained on massive text corpora scraped from the internet, which are known to contain a substantial amount of objectionable content. Owing to this, recent LLM developers have taken to \u201caligning\u201d such models via various finetuning mechanisms111\u201cAlignment\u201d can generically refer to many efforts to make AI systems better aligned with human values. Here we use it in the narrow sense adopted by the LLM community, that of ensuring that these models do not generate harmful content, although we believe our results will likely apply to other alignment objectives.; there are different methods employed for this task (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022b; Korbak et\u00a0al., 2023; Glaese et\u00a0al., 2022), but the overall goal of these approaches is to attempt ensure that these LLMs do not generate harmful or objectionable responses to user queries. And at least on the surface, these attempts seem to succeed: public chatbots will not generate certain obviously-inappropriate content when asked directly.\n\n\nIn a largely separate line of work, there has also been a great deal of effort invested into identifying (and ideally preventing) adversarial attacks on machine learning models (Szegedy et\u00a0al., 2014; Biggio et\u00a0al., 2013; Papernot et\u00a0al., 2016b; Carlini and Wagner, 2017b). Most commonly raised in computer vision domains (though with some applications to other modalities, including text), it is well-established that adding small perturbations to the input of a machine learning model can drastically change its output. To a certain extent, similar approaches are already known to work against LLMs: there exist a number of published \u201cjailbreaks\u201d: carefully engineered prompts that result in aligned LLMs generating clearly objectionable content (Wei et\u00a0al., 2023). Unlike traditional adversarial examples, however, these jailbreaks are typically crafted through human ingenuity\u2014carefully setting up scenarios that intuitively lead the models astray\u2014rather than automated methods, and thus they require substantial manual effort. Indeed, although there has been some work on automatic prompt-tuning for adversarial attacks on LLMs\u00a0(Shin et\u00a0al., 2020; Wen et\u00a0al., 2023; Jones et\u00a0al., 2023), this has traditionally proven to be a challenging task, with some papers explicitly mentioning that they had been unable to generate reliable attacks through automatic search methods (Carlini et\u00a0al., 2023). This owes largely to the fact that, unlike image models, LLMs operate on discrete token inputs, which both substantially limits the effective input dimensionality, and seems to induce a computationally difficult search.\n\n\nIn this paper, however, we propose a new class of adversarial attacks that can in fact induce aligned language models", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nAligned language models are supposed to be \u201chelpful and harmless\u201d Bai et\u00a0al. (2022):\nthey should respond helpfully to user interaction,\nbut avoid causing harm, either directly or indirectly.\nPrior work has focused extensively on how to train models to align with the preferences and goals of their creators.\nFor example, reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) Bai et\u00a0al. (2022); Ouyang et\u00a0al. (2022); Christiano et\u00a0al. (2023)\nfine-tunes a pretrained model to emit outputs that humans judge to be desirable, and discourages outputs that\nare judged to be undesirable.\nThis method has been successful at training models that\nproduce benign content that is generally agreeable.\n\n\nHowever, these models not are perfectly aligned.\nBy repeatedly interacting with models, humans have been able\nto \u201csocial engineer\u201d them into producing some harmful content (i.e., \u201cjailbreak\u201d attacks).\nFor example, early attacks on ChatGPT (one such alignment-tuned language model)\nworked by telling the model the user is a researcher studying language\nmodel harms and asking ChatGPT to help them produce test cases of what\na language model should not say.\nWhile there have been many such anecdotes where humans\nhave manually constructed harm-inducing prompts,\nit has been difficult to scientifically study this phenomenon.\n\n\nFortunately, the machine learning community has by now\nstudied the fundamental vulnerability of neural networks to\nadversarial examples for a decade\u00a0(Szegedy et\u00a0al., 2014; Biggio et\u00a0al., 2013).\nGiven any trained neural network and an arbitrary behavior, it is almost\nalways possible to construct an \u201cadversarial example\u201d that cause the selected behavior.\nMuch of the early adversarial machine learning work focused on the domain of image classification,\nwhere it was shown that it is possible to minimally modify images\nso that they will be misclassified as an arbitrary test label.\nBut adversarial examples have since been expanded to text\u00a0Jia and Liang (2017); Ebrahimi et\u00a0al. (2017); Alzantot et\u00a0al. (2018); Wallace et\u00a0al. (2019); Jones et\u00a0al. (2023) and other domains.\n\n\nIn this paper we unify these two research directions and\nstudy what we call adversarial alignment:\nthe evaluation of aligned models to adversarial inputs.\nThat is, we ask the question:\n\nAre aligned neural network models \u201cadversarially aligned\u201d?\n\n\n\nFirst, we show that current alignment techniques\u2014such as those used to fine-tune the Vicuna model\u00a0Chiang et\u00a0al. (2023)\u2014are an effective defense against existing state-of-the-art (white-box) NLP attacks. This suggests that the above question can be answered in the affirmative. Yet, we further show that existing attacks are simply not powerful enough to distinguish between robust and non-robust defenses: even when we guarantee that an adversarial input on the language model exists, we show that state-of-the-art attacks fail to find it. The true adversarial robustness of current alignment techniques thus remains an open question, which will require substantially stronger attacks to resolve.\n\n\nWe then turn our attention to today\u2019s most advanced multimodal models, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Flamingo and Gemini, which accept both text and images as input (OpenAI, 2023; Alayrac et\u00a0al., 2022; Pichai, 2023).\nSpecifically, we study open-source implementations with similar capabilities\u00a0Liu et\u00a0al. (2023); Zhu et\u00a0al. (2023); Gao et\u00a0al. (2023) since these proprietary models are not yet publicly accessible.\nWe find that\nwe can use the continuous-domain images as adversarial prompts\nto cause the language model to emit harmful toxic content (see, e.g., Figure\u00a01,\nor unfiltered examples in Appendix\u00a0C).\nBecause of this, we conjecture that improved NLP attacks may be able\nto", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThere has been a proliferation of LLM-based chat assistants (chatbots) that leverage supervised instruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to unlock new instruction following and conversational abilities\u00a0[31, 2, 30, 8, 52, 48, 14].\nOnce aligned with humans, these chat models are strongly preferred by human users over the original, unaligned models on which they are built.\nHowever, the heightened user preference does not always correspond to improved scores on traditional LLM benchmarks \u2013 benchmarks like MMLU\u00a0[19] and HELM\u00a0[24] cannot effectively tell the difference between these aligned models and the base models.\nThis phenomenon suggests that there is a fundamental discrepancy between user perceptions of the usefulness of chatbots and the criteria adopted by conventional benchmarks.\n\n\nWe argue that this discrepancy primarily arises due to\nexisting evaluation that only measures LLMs\u2019 core capability on a confined set of tasks (e.g., multi-choice knowledge or retrieval questions), without adequately assessing its alignment with human preference in open-ended tasks, such as the ability to accurately adhere to instructions in multi-turn dialogues.\nAs a demonstration, we show conversation histories with two models on an MMLU question in Figure\u00a01.\nThe two models are LLaMA-13B\u00a0[39], a pre-trained base model without fine-tuning, and Vicuna-13B, our fine-tuned model from LLaMA-13B on high-quality conversations (the training details are in Appendix\u00a0E).\nDespite the base LLaMA models showing competitive performance on conventional benchmarks (Table\u00a09), its answers to open-ended questions are often not preferred by humans.\nThis misalignment of conventional benchmarks underscores the core problem driving this paper:\nthe need for a robust and scalable automated method to evaluate LLM alignment with human preferences.\n\n\nFigure 1: Multi-turn dialogues between a user and two AI assistants\u2014LLaMA-13B (Assistant A) and Vicuna-13B (Assistant B)\u2014initiated by a question from the MMLU benchmark and a follow-up instruction. GPT-4 is then presented with the context to determine which assistant answers better.\n\n\nTo study this, we introduce two benchmarks with human ratings as the primary evaluation metric: MT-bench and Chatbot Arena.\nMT-bench is a series of open-ended questions that evaluate a chatbot\u2019s multi-turn conversational and instruction-following ability \u2013 two critical elements for human preference. MT-bench is also carefully constructed to differentiate chatbots based on their core capabilities, such as reasoning and math.\nIn addition, we develop Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced platform featuring anonymous battles between chatbots in real-world scenarios \u2013 Users engage in conversations with two chatbots at the same time and rate their responses based on personal preferences.\n\n\nWhile human evaluation is the gold standard for assessing human preferences, it is exceptionally slow and costly.\nTo automate the evaluation, we explore the use of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, as a surrogate for humans.\nBecause these models are often trained with RLHF, they already exhibit strong human alignment.\nWe call this approach \u201cLLM-as-a-judge\u201d.\nThis approach has been tried in our earlier blog post\u00a0[8] and other concurrent or follow-up work\u00a0[5, 29, 14, 12, 52, 18, 33, 40, 7, 43].\nHowever, there has not been a systematic study of this approach.\n\n\nIn this paper, we study the LLM-as-a-judge approach by comparing it to the gold standard of human evaluation.\nWe examine several potential limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge approach including position bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, and limited reasoning ability.\nWe show", " Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently improved dra-\nmatically in text generation. This improvement is driven in\nlarge part by scale and the ability to be instruction following\n(Mishra et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021;\nOuyang et al., 2022; Glaese et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022;\nWang et al., 2022, inter alia ). As with most technologies,\nLLMs have a potential for dual-use, where their language\ngeneration capabilities are used for malicious or nefarious\nends. For example, text generation models have already\nbeen used to produce hateful text (Vincent, 2016).\nIn this work, we show that instruction-following LLMs\n1University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign2Stanford University\n3University of California, Berkeley.

LLMs Behave Like Programs\nThe key observation that enables our attacks is that\ninstruction-following LLMs have abilities similar to stan-\ndard computer programs. This observation is also key in a\nclass of traditional program attacks called return-oriented\nprogramming (ROP) (Roemer et al., 2012). In ROP, an\nattacker gains control of the call stack and executes instruc-\ntions already present in memory. These instructions are\noften isolated into \u201cgadgets\u201d and can be chained together.\nSimilarly, recently introduced LLMs have several \u201cgadgets\u201d\navailable, which can be chained together. We identi\ufb01ed\nseveral capabilities in this work that we show are suf\ufb01cient\nto enable a variety of classical security attacks:\n1. String concatenation,\n2.

For an Conclusions\nWhile each of the mitigations discussed above are important to weigh on their own merits, there are\nsome crosscutting References 67Executive Summary\nIn recent years, arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) systems have signi\ufb01cantly improved and their capabilities have\nexpanded. In particular, AI systems called \u201cgenerative models\u201d have made great progress in automated\ncontent creation, such as images generated from text prompts. One area of particularly rapid devel-\nopment has been generative models that can produce original language, which may have bene\ufb01ts for\ndiverse \ufb01elds such as law and healthcare.\nHowever, there are also possible negative applications of generative language models, or \u201clanguage\nmodels\u201d for short. For malicious actors looking to spread propaganda\u2014information designed to shape\nperceptions to further an actor\u2019s interest\u2014these language models bring the promise of automating the\ncreation of convincing and misleading text for use in in\ufb02uence operations, rather than having to rely\non human labor. For society, these developments bring a new set of concerns: the prospect of highly\nscalable\u2014and perhaps even highly persuasive\u2014campaigns by those seeking to covertly in\ufb02uence public\nopinion.\nThis report aims to assess: how might language models change in\ufb02uence operations, and what steps\ncan be taken to mitigate these threats? This task is inherently speculative, as both AI and in\ufb02uence\noperations are changing quickly.\nMany ideas in the report were informed by a workshop convened by the authors in October 2021,\nwhich brought together 30 experts across AI, in\ufb02uence operations, and policy analysis to discuss the\npotential impact of language models on in\ufb02uence operations. The resulting report does not represent\nthe consensus of workshop participants, and mistakes are our own.\nWe hope this report is useful to disinformation researchers who are interested in the impact of emerging\ntechnologies, AI developers setting their policies and investments, and policymakers preparing for social\nchallenges at the intersection of technology and society.\nPotential Applications of Language Models to In\ufb02uence Operations\nWe analyzed the potential impact of generative language models on three well-known dimensions of\nin\ufb02uence operations\u2014the actors waging the campaigns, the deceptive behaviors leveraged as tactics,\nand the content itself\u2014and conclude that language models could signi\ufb01cantly affect how in\ufb02uence\noperations are waged in the future. These changes are summarized in Table 1.\nThe potential of language models to rival human-written content at low cost suggests that these mod-\nels\u2014like any powerful technology\u2014may provide distinct advantages to propagandists who choose to\nuse them. These advantages could expand access to a greater number of actors, enable new tactics of\nin\ufb02uence, and make a campaign\u2019s messaging far more tailored and potentially effective.\nProgress in In\ufb02uence Operations and Critical Unknowns\nTechnical progress in language models is unlikely to halt, so any attempt to understand how language\nmodels will affect future in\ufb02uence operations needs to take expected progress into account. Language\nmodels are likely to become more usable (making it easier to apply models to a task), reliable (reduc-\ning the chance that models produce outputs with obvious errors), and ef\ufb01cient (increasing the cost-\neffectiveness of applying a language model for in\ufb02uence operations).\n1Dimension1 Potential Change Due\nto Generative AI TextExplanation of Change\nLarger number and more diverse\ngroup of propagandists emerge.As generative models drive down the cost of\ngenerating propaganda, more actors may \ufb01nd\nit attractive to wage in\ufb02uence operations.\nActors\nOutsourced", " Introduction, his life and Appendix C.2. We \ufb01nd that the inter- and intra-group validation accuracies for predicting the human-\npreferred output are 72.4 \u00060.4%, and 69.6\u00060.9% respectively, suggesting our RMs can generalize\nwell to held-out labelers drawn from the same set as the training labelers.\nE.3 Metadata related work in Section 2, before diving\ninto our method and experiment details in Section 3, including our high-level methodology (3.1), task\nand dataset details (3.3 and 3.2), human data collection (3.4), how we trained our models (3.5), and\nour evaluation procedure (3.6). We then present our discussion of the limitations of our work in Section 5.3.\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d\nIn this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers\u2019 preferences that were in\ufb02uenced, among others\nthings, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them (as a paid job),\nand who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who\ndirectly produce the data that we use to \ufb01ne-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process\nand demographics in Related work\nResearch on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques\nto align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari\ngames (Christiano et al., 2017; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to \ufb01ne-tuning language\nmodels to summarize text (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; B\u00f6hm et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\n2021). This work is in turn in\ufb02uenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains\nsuch as dialogue (Jaques et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019; Hancock et al., 2019), translation (Kreutzer et al.,\n2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), story generation (Zhou\nand Xu, 2020), review generation (Cho et al., 2018), and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019).\nMadaan et al. (2022) use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance\nof GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with\n4a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2021). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to\naligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks.\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention re-\ncently (Gabriel, 2020). Kenton et al. (2021) catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from\nmisalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspeci\ufb01ed objectives. In concur-\nrent work, Askell et al. (2021) propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study\nsome simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-\ntask generalization in language models, where LMs are \ufb01ne-tuned on a broad range of public NLP\ndatasets (usually pre\ufb01xed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP\ntasks. There has been a range of work in this domain (Yi et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2021; Khashabi et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2021; Aribandi et al., 2021),", " Introduction\nContemporary text generation models (Radford\net al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) are capable of gen-\nerating harmful language, including hate speech, in-\nsults, profanities and threats (Gehman et al., 2020).\nThese harms are often grouped under the umbrella\nterm \u201ctoxicity\u201d.1\nTo enable safe language model (LM) use and\ndeployment, it is necessary to measure, understand\nthe origins, and undertake effective steps to miti-\ngate toxic text generation in LMs. Prior work has\nconsidered various approaches towards reducing\nLM toxicity, either by \ufb01ne-tuning a pre-trained\nLM (Gehman et al., 2020; Gururangan et al., 2020),\n\u0003Denotes equal contribution.\n1Although broad, this term typically does not capture less\nobvious, but no less important harms\u2014such as subtle or distri-\nbutional biases (Sap et al., 2019b; Sheng et al., 2019; Huang\net al., 2020; Abid et al., 2021).\nFigure 1: Unintended side effect of automatic toxi-\ncity reduction methods are combined,\nwe note that we are left with only 3 samples in the\nhighest toxicity band ( \u00150:75).\nE.2 Human Annotation Instructions\nFor the human toxicity evaluation we rely on the an-\nnotation instructions by PERSPECTIVE API,11but\nwe adapt them slightly for the context of language\nmodel generation, including additional questions\non comprehensibility, consistency, and grammati-\ncality.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nCan we build a imager that is thin and conforming to a curved surface?\nSuch a imager would be invaluable for many applications.\nFor example, it can be wrapped on a ball to produce a panorama.\nIt can enable flexible robots to see their environment and can be pressed against human skin to accurately sense blood flows.\nWhile recent advancements in flexible electronics [16] allow us to measure light intensity on a curved or flexible surface, it is very challenging to design lenses that are of a thin form factor and yet focus images on curved surfaces.\nOn the other hand, lensless imaging have delivered imaging solutions that are lightweight, compact and of thin form factor [5].\nSo far, lensless imaging techniques have been only developed for planar sensors, and we aim to incorporate flexible and curved sensors into lensless imagers.\nIn this paper, we take a step towards thin, surface conforming imager design, by proposing and analyzing the performance of a thin, lensless imager on a well-studied curved surface \u2014 the sphere.\n\n\nThe missing piece of designing thin imagers that sense on a curved surface lies in producing the modulation element.\nIn planar imagers, a modulation element, traditionally a lens, is used to provide a diverse set of measurements so that the inverse problem of image recovery is well conditioned.\nConsider the situation where a point light source is placed far from the sensor.\nIn absence of the modulation element, all pixels on a small planar sensor would all measure nearly identical measurements, as they receive nearly identical amount of light.\nA thin modulation elements such as an amplitude masks [2], phase masks [1], refractive [22] and diffractive [6] elements introduced diversity in the measurements so that the effective pixel response is rich and diverse enabling a well-conditioned inverse problem.\nHowever, such elements are difficult to manufacture precisely for use on a curved or potentially flexible surface.\n\n\nFigure 1: We present a thin form-factor lensless imager on spherical surface. Imaging on a non-planar surface has many advantages, for example, imaging a large angle of view without radial distortion and vignetting. This image from inside of a cube built with foam mat captures 180\u2218\u00d7133\u2218superscript180superscript133180^{\\circ}\\times 133^{\\circ}180 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u00d7 133 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT angle of view with 6030 pixels.\n\n\nWhile designing a modulation element to induce diversity in measurements of a curved sensor is challenging, the curved surfaces present us with another source of measurement diversity that is absent in planar imagers, namely, the orientation of the pixels.\nOn a curved sensor, the inherent diversity of pixel orientations is often sufficient to resolve the scene at a high angular resolution.\nFor example, if we had a spherical sensor comprised of photodiodes with very narrow cone of view, we could image a scene without any additional modulation.\nBut clearly, such a solution will have low light efficiency since we restrict the amount of light that enters each photodiode; this is especially true when we seek to resolve the scene at high resolution.\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose a design for lensless imaging using spherical sensors, where by tailoring the angular response of the pixels, we resolve the scene at high", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nWe have seen significant advancements in diffusion models\u00a0(Sohl-Dickstein et\u00a0al., 2015; Ho et\u00a0al., 2020; Yang et\u00a0al., 2021a; Nichol et\u00a0al., 2022) for the task of image synthesis. Existing studies demonstrate that the diffusion prior, embedded in synthesis models like Stable Diffusion\u00a0(Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022), can be applied to various downstream content creation tasks, including image\u00a0(Choi et\u00a0al., 2021; Avrahami et\u00a0al., 2022; Hertz et\u00a0al., 2022; Gu et\u00a0al., 2022; Mou et\u00a0al., 2024; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023; Gal et\u00a0al., 2023) and video\u00a0(Wu et\u00a0al., 2022; Molad et\u00a0al., 2023; Qi et\u00a0al., 2023) editing.\nIn this study, we extend the exploration beyond the realm of content creation and examine the potential benefits of using diffusion prior for super-resolution (SR). This low-level vision task presents an additional non-trivial challenge, as it requires high image fidelity in its generated content, which stands in contrast to the stochastic nature of diffusion models.\n\n\nA common solution to the challenge above involves training a SR model from scratch\u00a0(Saharia et\u00a0al., 2022b; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022; Sahak et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2022). To preserve fidelity, these methods use the low-resolution (LR) image as an additional input to constrain the output space. While these methods have achieved notable success, they often demand significant computational resources to train the diffusion model.\nMoreover, training a network from scratch can potentially jeopardize the generative priors captured in synthesis models, leading to suboptimal performance in the final network.\nThese limitations have inspired an alternative approach\u00a0(Choi et\u00a0al., 2021; Wang et\u00a0al., 2022; Chung et\u00a0al., 2022; Song et\u00a0al., 2023a; Meng and Kabashima, 2022), which involves incorporating constraints into the reverse diffusion process of a pre-trained synthesis model.\nThis paradigm avoids the need for model training while leveraging the diffusion prior. However, designing these constraints assumes knowing the image degradations as a priori, which are typically unknown and complex. Consequently, such methods exhibit limited generalizability.\n\n\nIn this study, we present StableSR, an approach that preserves pre-trained diffusion priors without making explicit assumptions about the degradations.\nSpecifically, unlike previous works\u00a0(Saharia et\u00a0al., 2022b; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022; Sahak et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) that concatenate the LR image to intermediate outputs, which requires one to train a diffusion model from scratch, our method only needs to fine-tune a lightweight time-aware encoder and a few feature modulation layers for the SR task.\nWhen applying diffusion models for SR, the LR condition should provide adaptive guidance for each diffusion step during the restoration process, i.e., stronger guidance at earlier iterations to maintain fidelity and weaker guidance later to avoid introducing degradations.\nTo this end, our encoder incorporates a time embedding layer to generate time-aware features, allowing the features in the diffusion model to be adaptively modulated at different iterations.\nBesides gaining improved training efficiency, keeping the original diffusion model frozen helps preserve the generative prior, which grants StableSR the capability of generating visually pleasant SR details and avoids overfitting to high-frequency degradations.\nOur experiments show that both the time-aware property of our encoder and the diffusion prior are crucial for achieving SR performance improvements.\n\n\nTo suppress randomness inherited from the diffusion model as well as the information loss due to the encoding process of the autoencoder\u00a0(Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022), inspired by Codeformer (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2022), we", " Introduction\nThanks to the training on massive data and huge com-\nputing power, text-to-image (T2I) generation [34, 32, 23,\n30, 6, 46, 29], which aims to generate images conditioned\non a given text/prompt, has demonstrated strong generation\nability.

The Conclusion and Limitation\nIn this paper, we aim to dig out the capabilities that\nT2I models have implicitly learned, e.g., the colorization\nand structuring capabilities, and then explicitly use them to\ncontrol the generation more accurately. We present that a\nlow-cost adapter model can achieve this purpose, as it is\nnot learning new generation abilities but learning an align-\nment between the condition information and internal knowl-\nedge in pre-trained T2I models. In addition to the simplic-\nity and lightweight structure, our T2I-Adapter 1) does not\naffect the original generation ability of the pre-trained T2I\nmodel; 2) has a wide range of applications in spatial color\ncontrol and elaborate structure control. 3) More than one\nadapter can be easily composed to achieve multi-condition\ncontrol. 4) Once trained, the T2I-Adapter can be directly\nused on custom models as long as they are \ufb01ne-tuned from\nthe same T2I model.

With the advent of\ntext-to-image diffusion\nmodels\u2009[54, 62, 72], we\ncan now create visually stunning images by typing in a text\nprompt.\nYet, text-to-image models are limited in the control\nthey provide over the spatial composition of the image;\nprecisely expressing complex layouts, poses, shapes and forms\ncan be difficult via text prompts alone.\nGenerating an image\nthat accurately matches our mental imagery often requires numerous\ntrial-and-error cycles of editing a prompt, inspecting the\nresulting images and then re-editing the prompt.\n\nCan we enable finer grained spatial control by letting users\nprovide additional images that directly specify their desired\nimage composition?\nIn computer\nvision and machine learning, these additional images (e.g.,\nedge maps, human pose skeletons, segmentation maps, depth,\nnormals, etc.) are often treated as conditioning on the image\ngeneration process. Image-to-image translation\nmodels\u2009[34, 98] learn the mapping\nfrom conditioning images to target images. The research\ncommunity has also taken steps to control text-to-image models\nwith spatial masks\u2009[6, 20],\nimage editing instructions\u2009[10],\npersonalization via\nfinetuning\u2009[21, 75], etc. While\na few problems (e.g., generating image variations,\ninpainting) can be resolved with training-free techniques like\nconstraining the denoising diffusion process or editing\nattention layer activations, a wider variety of problems like\ndepth-to-image, pose-to-image, etc., require end-to-end\nlearning and data-driven solutions.\n\nLearning conditional controls for large text-to-image\ndiffusion models in an end-to-end way is challenging. The\namount of training data for a specific condition may be\nsignificantly smaller than the data available for general\ntext-to-image training. For instance, the largest datasets\nfor various specific problems (e.g., object shape/normal, human\npose extraction, etc.) are usually about 100K in size, which\nis 50,000 times smaller than the\nLAION-5B\u2009[79] dataset that was used to\ntrain Stable Diffusion\u2009[82]. The direct finetuning or\ncontinued training of a large pretrained model with limited\ndata may cause overfitting and catastrophic\nforgetting\u2009[31, 75].\nResearchers have shown that such forgetting can be alleviated by restricting the number or rank of trainable parameters\u2009[14, 25, 31, 92].\nFor our problem, designing deeper or more customized neural architectures might be necessary for handling in-the-wild conditioning images with complex shapes and diverse high-level semantics.\n\nThis paper presents ControlNet, an end-to-end neural\nnetwork architecture that learns conditional controls for\nlarge pretrained text-to-image diffusion models (Stable\nDiffusion in our implementation). ControlNet preserves the\nquality and capabilities of the large model by locking its\nparameters, and also making a trainable copy of its\nencoding layers. This architecture treats the large pretrained\nmodel as a strong backbone for learning diverse conditional\ncontrols. The trainable copy and the original, locked model\nare connected with zero convolution layers, with weights\ninitialized to zeros so that they progressively grow during\nthe training. This architecture ensures that harmful noise is\nnot added to the deep features of the large diffusion model at\nthe beginning of training, and protects the large-scale\npretrained backbone in the trainable copy from being damaged\nby such noise.\n\n\nOur experiments show that ControlNet can control Stable\nDiffusion with various conditioning inputs, including Canny\nedges, Hough lines, user scribbles, human key points,\nsegmentation maps, shape normals, depths,\netc. (Figure\u20091). We test our approach using a\nsingle conditioning image, with or without text prompts, and\nwe demonstrate how our approach supports the composition of\nmultiple conditions. Additionally, we report that the\ntraining of ControlNet is robust and scalable on datasets of\ndifferent sizes, and that for some tasks like depth-to-image\nconditioning, training ControlNets on a single NVIDIA RTX\n3090Ti GPU can", "ABSTRACT\nMost existing Image Restoration (IR) models are task-speci\ufb01c, which can not be\ngeneralized to different degradation operators.

In 2019 IEEE", "ABSTRACT\nClassi\ufb01er guidance is a recently introduced method to trade off mode coverage\nand sample \ufb01delity in conditional diffusion models post training, in the same spirit\nas low temperature sampling or truncation in other types of generative models.\nClassi\ufb01er guidance combines the score estimate of a diffusion model with the\ngradient of an image classi\ufb01er and thereby requires training an image classi\ufb01er\nseparate from the diffusion model. It also raises the question of whether guidance\ncan be performed without a classi\ufb01er. We show that guidance can be indeed\nperformed by a pure generative model without such a classi\ufb01er: in what we\ncall classi\ufb01er-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional\ndiffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score\nestimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that\nobtained using classi\ufb01er guidance.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nDiffusion models have recently emerged as an expressive and \ufb02exible family of generative models,\ndelivering competitive sample quality and likelihood scores on image and audio synthesis tasks (Sohl-\nDickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021b; Kingma et al., 2021;\nSong et al., 2021a). These models have delivered audio synthesis performance rivaling the quality\nof autoregressive models with substantially fewer inference steps (Chen et al., 2021; Kong et al.,\n2021), and they have delivered ImageNet generationresults showing the effectiveness of classi\ufb01er-free guidance con\ufb01rm that\npure generative diffusion models are capable of maximizing classi\ufb01er-based sample quality metrics\nwhile entirely avoiding classi\ufb01er gradients. We look forward to further explorations of classi\ufb01er-free\nguidance in a wider variety of settings and data modalities.\n7 A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Ben Poole and Mohammad Norouzi for discussions.experiments is to serve as a proof of concept to demonstrate that classi\ufb01er-free\nguidance is able to attain a FID/IS tradeoff similar to classi\ufb01er guidance and to understand the\nbehavior of classi\ufb01er-free guidance, not necessarily to push sample quality metrics to state of the art\n5Figure 3: Classi\ufb01er-free guidance on 128x128 ImageNet.

For this purpose, we use the same model architectures and hyperparameters as\nthe guided diffusion models of Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) (apart from continuous time training as\nspeci\ufb01ed in Section 2); those hyperparameter settings were tuned for classi\ufb01er guidance and hence\nmay be suboptimal for classi\ufb01er-free guidance. Furthermore, since we amortize the conditional and\nunconditional models into the same architecture without an extra classi\ufb01er, we in fact are using less\nmodel capacity than previous work. Nevertheless, our classi\ufb01er-free guided models still produce\ncompetitive sample quality metrics and sometimes outperform prior work, as can be seen in the\nfollowing sections.\n4.1 V ARYING THE CLASSIFIER -FREE GUIDANCE STRENGTH\nHere we experimentally verify the main claim of this paper: that classi\ufb01er-free guidance is able\nto trade off IS and FID in a manner like classi\ufb01er guidance or GAN truncation. We apply our\nproposed classi\ufb01er-free guidance to 64\u000264and128\u0002128class-conditional ImageNet generation. In\nTable 1 and Fig. 4, we show sample quality effects of sweeping over the guidance strength won our\n664\u000264ImageNet models; Table 2 and Fig. 5 show the same for our 128\u0002128models.

(b) Representative results of inpainting, compared with score-SDE\u00a0[song2020score]. Reconstructions with score-SDE produce incoherent results, while our method produces high fidelity solutions.\n\n\nNevertheless, for certain problems (e.g. inpainting), currently used algorithms often produce unsatisfactory results when implemented naively (e.g. boundary artifacts, as shown in Fig.\u00a01 (b)).\nThe authors in [lugmayr2022repaint] showed that in order to produce high quality reconstructions, one needs to iterate back and forth between the noising and the denoising step at least >10absent10>10> 10 times per iteration. These iterations are computationally demanding and should be avoided, considering that diffusion models are slow to sample from even without such iterations.\nOn the other hand, a classic result of Tweedie\u2019s formula\u00a0[robbins1992empirical, stein1981estimation] shows that one can perform Bayes optimal denoising in one step, once we know the gradient of the log density. Extending such result, it was recently shown that one can indeed perform a single-step denoising with learned score functions for denoising problems from the general exponential family \u00a0[kim2021noisescore].\n\n\nIn this work, we leverage the denoising result through Tweedie\u2019s formula and show that such denoised samples can be the key to significantly improving the performance of reconstruction using diffusion models across arbitrary linear inverse problems, despite the simplicity in the implementation.\nMoreover, we theoretically prove that if the score function estimation is globally optimal, the correction term from the manifold constraint enforces the sample path to stay on the plane tangent to the data manifold111We coin our method Manifold Constrained Gradient (MCG)., so by combining with the reverse diffusion step, the solution becomes more stable and accurate.\n\n \n\n2 Related Works\n\n\n2.1 Diffusion Models\n\nContinuous Form\n\nFor a continuous diffusion process \ud835\udc99\u2062(t)\u2208\u211dn,t\u2208[0,1]formulae-sequence\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc61superscript\u211d\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc6101{\\boldsymbol{x}}(t)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{n},\\,t\\in[0,1]bold_italic_x ( italic_t ) \u2208 blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_t \u2208 [ 0 , 1 ], we set \ud835\udc99\u2062(0)\u223cp0\u2062(\ud835\udc99)=pd\u2062a\u2062t\u2062asimilar-to\ud835\udc990subscript\ud835\udc5d0\ud835\udc99subscript\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e{\\boldsymbol{x}}(0)\\sim p_{0}({\\boldsymbol{x}})=p_{data}bold_italic_x ( 0 ) \u223c italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_x ) =", " Introduction\nPristine-quality images could be degraded in any stage of\nthe whole circulation, from acquisition, compression, stor-\nage, transmission [61] to restoration by GAN-based algo-\n*Contribute equally.

A typical CNN with a\nlimited receptive field size fails to accurately model the light trans-\nport of the imaging system [Goodman 2005], leading to learned\nmodels which fail to reconstruct lensless images accurately and\nefficiently. Recent literature proposes neural networks that include\na physical model with a large receptive field [Boominathan et al .\n2020; Monakhova et al .2019]. These neural networks typically use\na single-shot calibration measurement of the Point-Spread Func-\ntion (PSF) to represent the physical model of the imaging system.\nHowever, without the use of precisely engineered masks [Boomi-\nnathan et al .2020; Tseng et al .2021], image formation in lensless\ncameras cannot be fully expressed by a single PSF model [Yanny\net al.2020]. This model mismatch can lead data-driven regulariz-\ners to hallucinate missing features or create overly smooth images.\nTherefore, the development of models that can correct for model\nerror without increased computational complexity or extensive cal-\nibration is of critical importance for the widespread adoption of\nlensless imaging. Our proposed method replaces ADMM with a\nlearned optimization scheme, improving image quality by reducing\nmodel error as opposed to intensive post-processing. The result is a\nversatile deeply-calibrated lensless imaging architecture that avoids\nmodel error in the resulting reconstructions. We provide the experiments with our in-house built camera, we ob-\nserve a lesser quality in image reconstructions when compared\nwith the state of the art datasets [Boominathan et al .2020; Mon-\nakhova et al .2019]. We believe these originate from the fact that the\noff-the-shelf diffuser we use does not fully resemble the case that\nwe draw our inspiration from [Antipa et al .2018]. However, our\nwork significantly improves the image quality both on benchmark\ndatasets [Monakhova et al. 2019] and our in-house built camera.\n2 RELATED WORK\nWe introduce a novel image reconstruction method for lensless\ncameras.

For a speci\ufb01c degradation model, image restoration can be addressed\nthrough end-to-end supervised training of neural networks, using pairs of original and degraded im-\nages [ 14,58,41]. However, real-world applications such as medical imaging often require \ufb02exibility\nto cope with multiple, possibly in\ufb01nite, degradation models [ 46]. Here, unsupervised approaches\nbased on learned priors [ 36], where the degradation model is only known and used during inference,\nmay be more desirable since they can adapt to the given problem without re-training [ 51]. By\nlearning sound assumptions over the underlying structure of images ( e.g., priors, proximal operators\nor denoisers), unsupervised approaches can achieve effective restoration without training on speci\ufb01c\ndegradation models [51, 40].\nUnder this unsupervised setting, priors based on deep neural networks have demonstrated impressive\nempirical results on ImageNet 1K ( 256\u0002256).\nMethod4\u0002super-resolution (Bicubic) Deblurring (Anisotropic)\nPSNR\"SSIM\"KID#NFEs# PSNR\"SSIM\" KID# NFEs#\nBaseline 21:68 0:40 73:87 0 19:96 0:27 55:00 0\nDGP 19:68 0:40 44:07 1500 22 :64 0:53 25:38 1500\nRED 22:65 0:46 54:90 100 11 :97 0:10 130:30 500\nSNIPS 16:16 0:14 69:69 1000 17 :49 0:20 48:37 1000\nDDRM 25:53 0:68 14:57 20 26:95 0:73 10:34 20\n23Original\n 4\u0002noiseless\n 4\u0002noisy\n 8\u0002noiseless\n 8\u0002noisy\n 16\u0002noiseless\n 16\u0002noisy\nFigure 7: Pairs of low-res and recovered 256\u0002256face images with a 20-step DDRM.

Espe-\ncially high-resolution synthesis of complex, natural scenes\nis presently dominated by scaling up likelihood-based mod-\nels, potentially containing billions of parameters in autore-\ngressive (AR) transformers [66,67]. In contrast, the promis-\ning Related Work\nGenerative Models for Image Synthesis The high di-\nmensional nature of images presents distinct challenges\nto generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) [27] allow for ef\ufb01cient sampling of high resolution\nimages with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are dif\ufb01-\n2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full\ndata distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth-\nods emphasize good density estimation which renders op-\ntimization more well-behaved. Variational autoencoders\n(V AE) [46] and \ufb02ow-based models [18, 19] enable ef\ufb01cient\nsynthesis of high resolution images [9, 44, 92], but sam-\nple quality is not on par with GANs. While autoregressive\nmodels (ARM) [6, 10, 94, 95] achieve strong performance\nin density estimation, computationally demanding architec-\ntures [97] and a sequential sampling process limit them to\nlow resolution images. Because pixel based representations\nof images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency de-\ntails [16,73], maximum-likelihood training spends a dispro-\nportionate amount of capacity on modeling them, resulting\nin long training times. To scale to higher resolutions, several\ntwo-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model\na compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels.\nRecently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82],\nhave achieved state-of-the-art methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(zjx) =\nN(z;E\u0016;E\u001b2)and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0;1)as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu-\nlarizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of jZjdifferent exemplars [96].\nTo obtain high-\ufb01delity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the\nKLterm by a factor\u001810\u00006or choose a high codebook dimensionality jZj.\nThe full objective to train the autoencoding model (E;D)reads:\nLAutoencoder = min\nE;Dmax\n \u0010\nLrec(x;D(E(x)))\u0000Ladv(D(E(x))) + logD (x) +Lreg(x;E;D)\u0011\n(25)\nDM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two\ncases when learning p(z)orp(zjy)(Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we sample z=E\u0016(x)+E\u001b(x)\u0001\"=:E(x),\nwhere\"\u0018N(0;1).

These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a\n\ufb01xed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization\ncapability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we\npropose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the\nrecently introduced score-based generative models.

Our method does not assume a \ufb01xed\nmeasurement process during training, and can thus be \ufb02exibly adapted to different\nmeasurement processes at test time.

Reconstructing CT and MRI images from raw measurements (sinograms\nfor CT and k-spaces for MRI) are well-known inverse problems. Speci\ufb01cally, measurements in\nCT are given by X-ray projections of an object from various directions, and measurements in MRI\nare obtained by inspecting the Fourier spectrum of an object with magnetic \ufb01elds. However, since\nobtaining the full sinogram for CT causes excessive ionizing radiation for patients, and measuring\nthe full k-space of MRI is very time-consuming, it has become important to reduce the number\nof measurements in CT and MRI. In many cases, only partial measurements, such as sparse-view\nsinograms and downsampled k-spaces, are available. Due to this loss of information, the inverse\nproblems in CT and MRI are often ill-posed, making image reconstruction especially challenging.\nWith the rise of machine learning, manymethods, we tune \u0011and\u0015in Eq.

In the deep learning era, many\nIQA approaches [12, 34, 36, 43, 49] have achieved signi\ufb01-\ncant success by leveraging the power of convolutional neu-\nral networks (CNNs). However, the CNN-based IQA mod-\nels are often constrained by the \ufb01xed-size input requirement\nin batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized\nor cropped to a \ufb01xed shape as shown in Figure 1 (b). This\npreprocessing is problematic for IQA because images in the\nwild have varying aspect ratios and resolutions. Resizing\nand cropping can impact image composition or introduce\ndistortions, thus changing the quality of the image.\nTo learn IQA on the full-size image, the existing CNN-\nbased approaches use either adaptive pooling or resizing to\nget a \ufb01xed-size convolutional feature map. MNA-CNN [25]\n1Checkpoints and code are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/google-research/tree/master/musiq\nFigure 1. In CNN-based models (b), images need to be resized or\ncropped to a \ufb01xed shape for batch training. However, such prepro-\ncessing can alter image aspect ratio and composition, thus impact-\ning image quality. Our patch-based MUSIQ model (a) can process\nthe full-size image and extract multi-scale features, which aligns\nwith the human visual system.\nprocesses a single image in each training batch which is not\npractical for training on a large dataset. Hosu et al. [16]\nextracts and stores \ufb01xed-size features of\ufb02ine, which costs\nadditional storage for every augmented image. To keep as-\npect ratio, Chen et al. [7] proposes a dedicated convolu-\ntion to preserve aspect ratio in the convolutional receptive\n\ufb01eld. Its evaluation veri\ufb01es the importance of aspect-ratio-\npreserving (ARP) in the IQA tasks. But it still needs resiz-\ning and smart grouping for effective batch training.\nIn this paper, we propose a patch-based multi-scale im-\nage quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to bypass the CNN con-\nstraints on \ufb01xed input size and predict the quality effectively\non the native resolution image as shown in Figure 1 (a).\nTransformer [38] is \ufb01rst proposed for natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) and has recently been studied for various vi-\nsion tasks [4\u20136, 11]. Among these, the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) [11] splits each image into a sequence of \ufb01xed-size\npatches, encodes each patch as a token, and then appliesarXiv:2108.05997v1  [cs.CV]  12 Aug 2021Transformer to the sequence for image classi\ufb01cation. In\ntheory, such kind of patch-based Transformer models can\nhandle arbitrary numbers of patches (up to memory con-\nstraints), and therefore do not require preprocessing the in-\nput image to a \ufb01xed resolution. This motivates us to apply\nthe patch-based Transformer on the IQA tasks with the full-\nsize images as input.\nAnother aspect for improving IQA models is to imi-\ntate the human visual system which captures an image in\na multi-scale fashion [1]. Previous works [16, 22, 48]\nhave shown the bene\ufb01t of using multi-scale features ex-\ntracted from CNN feature maps at different depths. This\ninspires us to transform the native resolution image into a\nmulti-scale representation, enabling the Transformer\u2019s self-\nattention mechanism to capture information on both \ufb01ne-\ngrained detailed patches and coarse-grained global patches.\nBesides, unlike the convolution operation in CNNs that has\na relatively limited receptive \ufb01eld, self-attention can attend\nto the whole input sequence and it can therefore effectively\ncapture the image quality at different granularities.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to apply the Trans-\nformer on the multi-aspect-ratio multi-scale input. Al-\nthough self-attention accepts arbitrary length", " Introduction\nGenerative models, such as generative adversarial net-\nworks (GAN) [3, 10, 19], normalizing flows [21], and vari-\national autoencoders [42], have shown remarkable quality\nin image generation, and have been applied to numerous\npurposes such as image-to-image translation [7, 11, 31, 32,\n35, 47] and image editing [1, 12, 36].\nThere are mainly two approaches to control generative\nmodels to generate images as desired: one is by designing\nthe conditional generative models for the desired purpose,\nand the other is by leveraging well-performed unconditionalgenerative models.\nThe first approach learns to control by providing the de-\nsired condition in training procedure and has shown remark-\nable performance on various tasks, such as segmentation\nmask conditioned generation [31, 59], style transfer [9, 50],\nand inpainting [23, 52]. The second approach utilizes high-\nquality generative models, such as StyleGAN [19, 20] or\nBigGAN [3]. Shen et al. [36] and H \u00a8ark\u00a8onen et al. [12] ma-\nnipulate semantic attributes of images by analyzing latent\nspace of pre-trained generative models, while Huh et al .\n[16] and Zhu et al. [57] perform image editing by projecting\nimage into the latent space.\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) [14,\n39], an iterative generative model, has shown comparable\nperformance to the state-of-the-art models in unconditional\nimage generation. DDPM learns to model the Markov tran-\nsition from simple distribution to data distribution and gen-\nerates diverse samples through sequential stochastic tran-\nsitions. Samples obtained from the DDPM depend on the\ninitial state of the simple distribution and each transition.\nHowever, it is challenging to control DDPM to generate\nimages with desired semantics, since the stochasticity of\ntransitions generates images with inconsistent high-level se-\nmantics, even from the same initial state.\nIn this work, we propose a learning-free method, itera-\ntive latent variable refinement (ILVR), to condition the gen-\neration process in well-performing unconditional DDPM.\nEach transition in the generation process is refined utilizing\na given reference image. By matching each latent variable,\nILVR ensures the given condition in each transition thus en-\nables sampling from a conditional distribution. Thus, ILVR\ngenerates high-quality images sharing desired semantics.\nWe describe user controllability of our method, which\nenables control on semantic similarity of generated images\nto the refenence. Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 4 show samples sharing\nsemantics ranging from coarse to fine information. Besides,\nreference images can be selected from unseen data domains.\nFrom these properties, we were motivated to leverage un-\nconditional DDPM learned on single data domain to multi-\ndomain image translation; a challenging task where exist-\ning works had to learn on multiple data domains. Further-\nmore, we extend our method to paint-to-image and edit-\ning with scribbles (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). We demonstrate that\nour ILVR enables leveraging a single unconditional DDPM\nmodel on these various tasks without any additional learn-\ning or models. Measuring Fr \u00b4echet Inception Distance (FID)\nand Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), we\nconfirm that our generation method from various downsam-\npling factors provides control over diversity while maintain-\ning visual quality.\nOur paper makes the following contributions:\n\u2022 We propose ILVR, a method of refining each transi-\ntion in the generative process by matching each latentvariable with given reference image.\n\u2022 We investigate several properties that allows user con-\ntrollability on semantic similarity to the reference.\n\u2022 We demonstrate that our ILVR enables leveraging un-\nconditional DDPM in various image generation tasks\nincluding multi-domain image translation, paint-to-\nimage, and editing with scribbles.\n2.

Like many such inverse prob-\nlems, image super-resolution is challenging because multi-\nple output images may be consistent with a single input im-\nage, and the conditional distribution of output images given\nthe input typically does not conform well to simple para-\nmetric distributions, e.g., a multivariate Gaussian. Accord-\ningly, while simple regression-based results in Figure 6, it is interesting to inspect those images that maximize the fool rates for a\ngiven technique, as well as those images that minimize the fool rate. This provides insight into the nature of the problems\nthat models exhibit, as well as cases in which the model outputs are good enough to regularly fool people.\nIn Figure D.1 we display the images with the lowest fool rates generated by PULSE [28] and SR3 for both Task-1 (the\nconditional task), and Task-2, (the unconditional task). In order to be consistent with our human study interface, we show\nthe corresponding low resolution image only for Task-1. Notice that images from PULSE for which the fool rate is low have\nobvious distortions, and the fool rates are lower than 10% for both tasks. For SR3, by comparison, the images with the lowest\nfool rates are still reasonably good, with much higher fool rates of 14% and 19% in Task-1, and 21% and 26% in Task-2.\nFigure D.2 shows images that best fool human subjects. In this case, it is interesting to note that the best fool rates for\nSR3 are 84% and 88%. The corresponding original images are somewhat noisy, and as a consequence, many subjects refer\nthe SR3 outputs.Task-1: Human Evaluation given low-resolution inputs\nLowest Mean Fool Rates for PULSE Lowest Mean Fool Rates for SR3\nPULSE Input SR3 SR3 Input PULSE\nFool Rate: 0% Fool Rate: 53.4% Fool Rate: 14% Fool Rate: 4.5%\nFool Rate: 2.2% Fool Rate: 60.4% Fool Rate: 18.6% Fool Rate: 11.4%\nHighest Mean Fool Rates for PULSE Highest Mean Fool Rates for SR3\nPULSE Input SR3 SR3 Input PULSE\nFool Rate: 63.4% Fool Rate: 62.7% Fool Rate: 88.3% Fool Rate: 38.6%\nFool Rate: 63.4% Fool Rate: 69.7% Fool Rate: 83.7% Fool Rate: 54.5%\nFigure D.1: Examples with lowest and highest fool rates for PULSE and SR3 based on Task-1.

We provide details about the display captured setup, the\nqualitative performance of FlatNet-gen-UC on both cropped and full measurements, the variation of performance of the deep networks\nwith respect to the number of parameters, additional detail on the trainable inversion stage, the performance of FlatNet-gen \ufb01netuned\non unconstrained cropped indoor captures and the performance of both FlatNet-sep and FlatNet-gen on scenes containing bright\nobjects.\nIndex Terms \u2014lensless imaging, image reconstruction\n!\n1 D ISPLAY CAPTURE SETUP\nTo capture a display-captured image using FlatCam [1] and\nPhlatCam [2], the image is resized so as to occupy the\nbiggest central square on a 24-inch monitor using bicubic in-\nterpolation. The monitor was placed at appropriate distance\nso that the image occupied the \ufb01eld of view of the cameras.\nFor FlatCam, this was around 1 foot, while for PhlatCam,\nthis was around 16 inches. This setup is \ufb01xed for all image\ncaptures such that the alignment of the monitor pixels to\nthe camera pixels is uniform throughout both training and\ntest. The white balance setting for FlatCam is \ufb01xed to be\nthe white balance setting obtained in the FlatCam\u2019s (i.e.\nPointGrey Flea3) automatic white balance mode when an\nall-white image is displayed on the monitor. The exposure\ntime is set to PointGrey\u2019s automatic mode, and the camera\u2019s\ngain is set to 0dB. For PhlatCam prototype using a Basler\nace camera, the white balance setting was estimated once\nbefore the capture began by capturing a demo picture. The\nexposure was set at 10000 microseconds. Figure 1 shows\nthe setup for FlatCam capture. The setup for PhlatCam is\nsimilar.\n2 Q UALITATIVE COMPARISON FOR UNCALI -\nBRATED PSF C ASE\nIn Section 4.3.2 and 4.4.1 of the main paper, we provided the\nquantitative comparison for FlatNet-gen with Le-ADMM\nand Tikh+U-Net. In this section, we provide the visual re-\nsults for the uncalibrated versions of the same. In particular,\nwe use PSF simulated using the method described in Section\n3.1.2 and use this PSF for learning Le-ADMM, Tikh+U-\nNet and FlatNet-gen. We provide the comparison for both\nfull measurement in Figure 2 and cropped measurement\nin Figure 3. We can see clearly that the performance of\nFlatNet-gen-UC is very close to its calibrated counterpart\ni.e. FlatNet-gen-C. However, this is not the case with Le-\nADMM and Tikh+U-Net.\nFig. 1. The display capture setup for FlatCam. A similar setup was\nused for PhatCam.\n3 E FFECT OF PARAMETERS ON PERFORMANCE OF\nFLATNET-GEN\nIn this section, we investigate how FlatNet-gen compares\nagainst Le-ADMM and Tikh+U-Net in terms of perfor-\nmance for different parameter count. In particular, we train\nFlatNet-gen, Tikh+U-Net and Le-ADMM for different vari-\nants of U-Net, keeping the number of learnable parameters\nconstant in the trainable inversion stage for FlatNet-gen and\nunrolled ADMM block for Le-ADMM. U-Net-N refers to\nthe variant of U-Net for which the number of \ufb01lters in a\nconvolutional block increases from N to 8N and reduces\nback to N. We perform this experiment for N = 32, 64 and\n128. Table 1 provides the variation of the average PSNR and\nLPIPS for Tikh+U-Net, Le-ADMM and FlatNet-gen against\nthe total number of learnable parameters. It is clear that\nFlatNet-gen outperforms both Tikh+U-Net and Le-ADMM\nfor different parameter counts at the cost of slight increase\nin the relative number of learnable parameters. In the main\ntext, we report the best model for each approach i.e. with\nU-Net-128.arXiv:2010.15440v1  [eess.IV]", " Introduction\nMiniature wide \ufb01eld\ufb02uorescence microscopes enable\nimportant applications in systems biology, for example, the\noptical recording of neural activity in freely moving ani-\nmals1\u20134and long-term in situ imaging within incubators\nand lab-on-a-chip devices. These miniature microscopes,commonly called \u201cMiniscopes, \u201dare developed by a vibrant\nopen-source community\n5and made of 3D-printed parts\nand off-the-shelf components. Although the Miniscope isdesigned for 2D \ufb02uorescence imaging only, many appli-\ncations can bene \ufb01t from imaging 3D structures.\nVolumetric microscopy methods, as discussedin the next section.\nPhase mask optimization using matrix coherence\nGiven the \ufb01rst-principles guidance in the above sec-\ntions, we set the number of microlenses, their character-istic aperture size and their focal length distribution; next,we aim to optimize the microlens positions and aberra-tions to maximize the performance. To make the opti-mization computationally feasible, we ignore the \ufb01eld-\nvarying changes in the PSF and assume that the system isshift invariant for the purposes of design.\nTo optimize the microlens parameters, \u03b8, in terms of\nthe on-axis PSFs at each depth, we set up a loss functionto be optimized that consists of two terms. The \ufb01rst term,Fig. 6 Phase mask parameterized by the point-wise maximum of\nconvex spheres. Each sphere is outlined by a dashed line, and the\n\ufb01nal optic is shaded blue (not to scale)Yanny et al. Light: Science & Applications           (2020) 9:171 Page 10 of 13a cross-coherence loss, promotes good axial resolution by\nensuring that the PSFs at different depths are as dissimilaras possible. Cross-coherence between any two depths is\nde\ufb01ned as kh\u00f0u;v;z\nn\u00de?h\u00f0u;v;zm\u00dek1:\u00bcmaxh\u00f0u;v;zn\u00de? \u00bd\nh\u00f0u;v;zm\u00de/C138, where \u22c6represents the 2D correlation and\nmax [\u00b7] is the element-wise maximum. Intuitively, wewant the cross-coherence to be small, as it represents theworst-case ambiguity that would arise by placing twopoint sources adversarially at depths spaced according tothe separation of their PSF cross-correlation peaks. Bycomputing this quantity for all pairs of z-depths, we can\nproduce a differentiable \ufb01gure-of-merit that optimizes the\nmatrix coherence\n24between depths. In practice, rather\nthan optimizing the cross-coherence, we smoothlyapproximate the max\n33using xkk1/C25\u03c3lnPexp\u00f0x2=\u03c3\u00de.\nHere, \u03c3> 0 is a tuning parameter that trades off the\naccuracy of the approximation with the smoothness. Forour purposes, this has the advantage of penalizing all largecross-correlation values, not just the single largest. We\ndenote this /C1kk\n1.\nThe total cross-coherence loss is then:\nq\u00f0\u03b8\u00de\u00bcX\nnX\nm>nh\u00f0u;v;\u03b8;zn\u00de?h\u00f0u;v;\u03b8;zm\u00de kk1\n\u00f012\u00de\nThe second term in the optimization ensures that the\nlateral resolution is maintained. To do so, we optimize theautocorrelation of the PSF at each depth using the fre-quency domain least-squares method. The analysis in the\u201cLateral Resolution \u201dsection above applies only to a single\nmicrolens; building a phase mask of multiple lenses gen-\nerally degrades resolution by introducing dips in thespectrum that reduce contrast at certain spatial fre-quencies. Hence, we treat the single-lens case as an upperlimit that de \ufb01nes the bandlimit of the multi-lens PSF. To\nreduce the spectral ripple, we penalize the \u2018\n2distance\nbetween the MTFs of the PSF and a diffraction-limitedsingle microlens, | H|. We include a weighting term,\ndenoted as D, that ignores spatial frequencies beyond the\nbandlimit, as well as low spatial frequencies that are lesscritical and dif \ufb01cult to optimize owing to out-of-focus\nmicrolenses.

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse\nimplication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational\ninference to train a Langevin-like sampler.

Despite\nthis, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such\nas PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail\nto account for many nuances of human perception. Re-\ncently, the deep learning community has found that features\nof the VGG network trained on ImageNet classi\ufb01cation has\nbeen remarkably useful as a training loss for image syn-\nthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \u201cpercep-\ntual losses\u201d? What elements are critical for their success?\nTo answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of\nhuman perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically\nevaluate deep features across different architectures and\ntasks and compare them with classic metrics. We \ufb01nd that\ndeep features outperform all previous metrics by large mar-\ngins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not re-\nstricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across\ndifferent deep architectures and levels of supervision (su-\npervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our re-\nsults suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent prop-\nerty shared across deep visual representations.\n1. Motivation\nThe ability to compare data items is perhaps the most\nfundamental operation underlying all of computing. Inmany areas of computer science it does not pose much dif-\n\ufb01culty: one can use Hamming distance to compare binary\npatterns, edit distance to compare text \ufb01les, Euclidean dis-\ntance to compare vectors, etc. The unique challenge of com-\nputer vision is that even this seemingly simple task of com-\nparing visual patterns remains a wide-open problem. Not\nonly are visual patterns very high-dimensional and highly\ncorrelated, but, the very notion of visual similarity is often\nsubjective, aiming to mimic human visual perception. For\ninstance, in image compression, the goal is for the com-\npressed image to be indistinguishable from the original by\na human observer, irrespective of the fact that their pixel\nrepresentations might be very different.\nClassic per-pixel measures, such as `2Euclidean dis-\ntance, commonly used for regression problems, or the re-\nlated Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), are insuf\ufb01cient\nfor assessing structured outputs such as images, as they as-\nsume pixel-wise independence. A well-known example is\nthat blurring causes large perceptual but small `2change.\nWhat we would really like is a \u201cperceptual distance,\u201d\nwhich measures how similar are two images in a way\nthat coincides with human judgment. This problem has\nbeen a longstanding goal, and there have been numerous\nperceptually motivated distance metrics proposed, such as\nSSIM [58], MSSIM [60], FSIM [62], and HDR-VDP [34].\nHowever, constructing a perceptual metric is challeng-\ning, because human judgments of similarity (1) depend on\nhigh-order image structure [58], (2) are context-dependent\n1arXiv:1801.03924v2  [cs.CV]  10 Apr 2018OriginalPerturbed Patches\n(a)Traditional\nOriginalPerturbed Patches (b)CNN-based\nFigure 2: Example distortions.

Scanning and multi-shot methods for imaging through\nscattering [ 20\u201322]. These works have similar mathematical mod-\nels to our system, but instead of trying to mitigate the effects\nof unwanted scattering, here we use the diffuser as an optical\nelement in our system design. Therefore, we choose a thin, opti-\ncally smooth diffuser that refracts pseudorandomly (as opposed\nto true random scattering). Such diffusers have been shown to\nproduce high contrast patterns under incoherent illumination,\nenabling light \ufb01eld imaging [ 23], and have also been used to\nrecord coherent holograms [ 10,24]. Multiple scattering with\ncoherent illumination has been demonstrated as an encoding\nmechanism for 2D compressed sensing [ 25], but necessitates aninef\ufb01cient transmission matrix calibration approach, limiting re-\nconstructions to a few thousand pixels. We achieve similar bene-\n\ufb01ts without needing coherent illumination, and, unlike previous\nwork, we use compressed sensing to add depth information.\nFinally, our system is designed to enable simpler calibration and\nmore ef\ufb01cient computation, allowing for 3D reconstruction at\nmegavoxel scales with superior image quality.\nA. System Overview\nDiffuserCam is part of the class of mask-based lensless imagers\nin which a phase or amplitude mask is placed a small distance\nin front of a sensor, with no main lens. Our mask (the diffuser)\nis a thin transparent phase object with smoothly varying thick-\nness (see Fig. 1). When illuminated by an incoherent source\nsuf\ufb01ciently far from the sensor, the convex bumps concentrate\nlight into high-frequency pseudorandom caustic patterns which\nare captured by the sensor. The caustic patterns, termed Point\nSpread Functions (PSFs), vary with the 3D position of the source,\nthereby capturing 3D information.\nTo illustrate how the caustics encode 3D information, Fig. 2\nshows simulations of caustic PSFs as a function of point source\nlocation in object space. A lateral shift of the point source causes\na lateral translation of the PSF. An axial shift of the point source\ncauses (approximately) a scaling of the PSF. Hence, each 3D\nposition in the volume generates a unique PSF. The resolution\nof our camera depends on the structure and spatial frequencies\npresent in the caustic patterns. Because the caustics retain high\nspatial frequencies over a large range of depths, DiffuserCam\nattains good lateral resolution for objects at any depth within\nthe volumetric \ufb01eld-of-view (FoV).\nBy assuming that all points in the scene are incoherent with\neach other, the measurement can be modeled as a linear combi-\nnation of PSFs from different 3D positions. We represent this as\nmatrix-vector multiplication:\nb=Hv, (1)\nwhere bis a vector representing the 2D sensor measurement\nand vis a vector representing the intensity of the object at every\npoint in the 3D FoV , sampled on a user-chosen grid (discussed in\nSection 3).

While convolutional networks\nhave already existed for a long time [8], their success was limited due to the\nsize of the available training sets and the size of the considered networks. The\nbreakthrough by Krizhevsky et al. [7] was due to supervised training of a large\nnetwork with 8 layers and millions of parameters on the ImageNet dataset with\n1 million training images. Since then, even larger and deeper networks have been\ntrained [12].\nThe typical use of convolutional networks is on classi\fcation tasks, where\nthe output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks,\nespecially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include\nlocalization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. More-\nover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks.\nHence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict\nthe class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixelarXiv:1505.04597v1  [cs.CV]  18 May 20152\ncopy and cropinput\nimage\ntileoutput \nsegmentation \nmap641\n128\n256\n512\n1024max pool 2x2\nup-conv 2x2conv 3x3, ReLU572 x 572\n284\u00b264\n128\n256\n512570 x 570\n568 x 568\n282\u00b2\n280\u00b2140\u00b2\n138\u00b2\n136\u00b268\u00b2\n66\u00b2\n64\u00b232\u00b2\n28\u00b256\u00b2\n54\u00b2\n52\u00b2512\n104\u00b2\n102\u00b2\n100\u00b2200\u00b230\u00b2\n198\u00b2\n196\u00b2392 x 392\n390 x 390\n388 x 388\n388 x 388\n102451225625612864128642\nconv 1x1\nFig. 1.

In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF", " \n\nI INTRODUCTION\n\n\nMobile robots, and especially legged ones, have the capacity to evolve into multi-purpose machines, useful in many application scenarios, such as production sites, household services, remote inspection, and disaster search-and-rescue\u00a0[1]. Path planning is crucial in enabling legged robots to navigate autonomously and effectively complete the attributed tasks in various complex environments. Several studies, e.g.,\u00a0[2, 3], were dedicated towards the development of safe and efficient path planning algorithms, many of which utilize traditional methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and A\u2217superscript\ud835\udc34A^{*}italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2217 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT-based methods\u00a0[4, 5]. However, such approaches often struggle to effectively handle the complexities and uncertainties associated with real-time sensor inputs\u00a0[6]. Efficient and reliable path planning for quadrupeds is an ongoing challenge, with data driven approaches, such as Neural A*\u00a0[7] and ViT-A*\u00a0[8], showing promising efforts into overcoming the shortcomings of traditional approaches. Learning from demonstration methods using image conditioned Diffusion, have also shown promising results in path planning, applied mainly to manipulators\u00a0[9, 10, 11], however, with minimal literature on their application on quadrupeds. Diffusion policies iteratively infer the action-score gradient, conditioned on visual observations. This allows for expression of multi-modal action distributions and scalability to higher-dimensional output space (allowing the generation of sequence of future actions), and training stability while maintaining distributional expressivity\u00a0[9].\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) \n\n\n\n\n\n(b) \n\n\n\n\n\n(c) \n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of DiPPeR global path generation process. \n\n\nFigure 2: DiPPeR - Image Conditioned Diffusion Training Pipeline: A Map Image Observations sample O\ud835\udc42Oitalic_O is fed to the ResNet-18 Visual Encoder and converted to latent embeddings o\ud835\udc5coitalic_o.

We develop a training and inference pipeline using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture.

In Sec.\u00a0II, we briefly introduce literature in path planning relevant to our proposed method. In Sec.\u00a0III, we provide the necessary background knowledge. In Sec.\u00a0IV, we define our proposed method, with our experimental results presented in Sec.\u00a0V. Finally, in Sec.\u00a0VI, we summarize the results and we conclude with some future work.\n\n \n\nII RELATED WORK\n\n\nPath planning algorithms, have a long history in robotics and are primarily split between classical and data-driven.\n\n\n\nII-A Classical Path Planning\n\n\nClassical approaches in path planning rely on search-based and sampling-based methods. Search-based path planning provides mathematical guarantees of converging to a solution", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nPolicy learning from demonstration, in its simplest form, can be formulated as the supervised regression task of learning to map observations to actions.\nIn practice however, the unique nature of predicting robot actions \u2014 such as the existence of multimodal distributions, sequential correlation, and the requirement of high precision \u2014 makes this task distinct and challenging compared to other supervised learning problems.\n\n\nPrior work attempts to address this challenge by exploring different action representations (Fig 1 a) \u2013 using mixtures of Gaussians Mandlekar et\u00a0al. (2021), categorical representations of quantized actions Shafiullah et\u00a0al. (2022),\nor by switching the the policy representation (Fig 1 b) \u2013 from explicit to implicit to better capture multi-modal distributions Florence et\u00a0al. (2021); Wu et\u00a0al. (2020).\n\n\nIn this work, we seek to address this challenge by introducing a new form of robot visuomotor policy that generates behavior via a \u201cconditional denoising diffusion process Ho et\u00a0al. (2020) on robot action space\u201d, Diffusion Policy. In this formulation, instead of directly outputting an action, the policy infers the action-score gradient, conditioned on visual observations, for K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K denoising iterations (Fig. 1 c).\nThis formulation allows robot policies to inherit several key properties from diffusion models \u2013 significantly improving performance.\n\n\n\u2022\n\nExpressing multimodal action distributions.\nBy learning the gradient of the action score function Song and Ermon (2019) and performing Stochastic Langevin Dynamics sampling on this gradient field, Diffusion policy can express arbitrary normalizable distributions Neal et\u00a0al. (2011), which includes multimodal action distributions, a well-known challenge for policy learning.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nHigh-dimensional output space. As demonstrated by their impressive image generation results, diffusion models have shown excellent scalability to high-dimension output spaces. This property allows the policy to jointly infer a sequence of future actions instead of single-step actions, which is critical for encouraging temporal action consistency and avoiding myopic planning.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nStable training.\nTraining energy-based policies often requires negative sampling to estimate an intractable normalization constant, which is known to cause training instability Du et\u00a0al. (2020); Florence et\u00a0al. (2021). Diffusion Policy bypasses this requirement by learning the gradient of the energy function and thereby achieves stable training while maintaining distributional expressivity. \n\n\n\n\n\nOur primary contribution is to bring the above advantages to the field of robotics and demonstrate their effectiveness on complex real-world robot manipulation tasks. To successfully employ diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning, we present the following technical contributions that enhance the performance of Diffusion Policy and unlock its full potential on physical robots:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nClosed-loop action sequences. We combine the policy\u2019s capability to predict high-dimensional action sequences with receding-horizon control to achieve robust execution. This design allows the policy to continuously re-plan its action in a closed-loop manner while maintaining temporal action consistency \u2013 achieving a balance between long-horizon planning and responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nVisual conditioning. We introduce a vision-conditioned diffusion policy, where the visual observations are treated as conditioning instead of a part of the joint data distribution. In this formulation, the policy extracts the visual representation once regardless of the denoising iterations, which drastically reduces the computation and enables real-time action inference.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTime-series diffusion transformer. We propose a new transformer-based diffusion network that minimizes the over-smoothing effects of typical CNN-based models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks", " Introduction to Robotic Manipulation .

While some objectives are easy to model (e.g., joint limits, smoothness), others (e.g., collision avoidance, grasp pose selection) are more expensive to model and are therefore commonly approximated by learning-based approaches\u00a0[4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\n\n\nData-driven models are usually integrated into motion optimization either as sampling functions\u00a0(explicit generators)\u00a0[6, 9], or cost functions\u00a0(scalar fields)\u00a0[10, 4].\nWhen facing multi-objective optimization scenarios, the explicit generators do not allow a direct composition with other objectives, requiring two or even more separate phases during optimization\u00a0[11]. Looking back at the example of LABEL:fig:main_figure, a common practice is to learn a grasp generator as an explicit model, sample top-k grasps, and then find the trajectory that, initialized by a grasp candidate, solves the task with a minimum cost. Given the grasp sampling is decoupled from the trajectory planning, it might happen the sampled grasps to be unfeasible for the problem, leading to an unsolvable trajectory optimization problem.\nOn the other hand, learned scalar fields represent task-specific costs that can be combined with other learned or heuristic cost functions to form a single objective function for a joint optimization process. However, these cost functions are often learned through cross-entropy optimization\u00a0[6, 12] or contrastive divergence\u00a0[13, 10], creating hard discriminative regions in the learned model that lead to large plateaus in the learned field with zero or noisy slope regions\u00a0[14, 15], thereby making them unsuitable for pure gradient-based optimization. Thus, it is a common strategy to rely on task-specific samplers that first generate samples close to low-cost regions before optimizing\u00a0[6, 12].\n\n\nIn this work, we propose learning smooth data-driven cost functions, drawing inspiration from state-of-the-art diffusion generative models\u00a0[16, 17, 18, 19, 20].\nBy smoothness, we refer to the cost function exposing informative gradients in the entire space.\nWe propose learning these smooth cost functions in the SE(3) robot\u2019s workspace, thus defining task-specific SE(3) cost functions.\nIn particular, in this work, we show how to learn diffusion models for 6DoF grasping, leveraging open-source vastly annotated 6DoF grasp pose datasets like Acronym\u00a0[21].\nSE(3)\u00a0diffusion models allow moving initially random samples to low-cost regions (regions of good grasping poses on objects) by evolving a gradient-based inverse diffusion process\u00a0[22] (cf.\u00a0Fig.\u00a01). SE(3) diffusion models come with two benefits. First, we get smooth cost functions in SE(3) that can be directly used in motion optimization. Second, they better cover and represent multimodal distributions, like in a 6DoF grasp generation scenario, leading to better and more sample efficient performance of the subsequent robot planning.\n\n\nConsequently, we propose a joint grasp and motion optimization framework using the learned 6DoF grasp diffusion model as cost function and combining it with other differentiable costs (trajectory smoothness, collision avoidance, etc.). All costs combined (learned and hand-designed) form a single, smooth objective", " introduction . MIT press, 2018.\nZhendong Wang, Huangjie Zheng, Pengcheng He, Weizhu Chen, and Mingyuan Zhou.

Its appeal comes from employing learning\ntechniques only where they are the most mature and\neffective: for the approximation of unknown environment\ndynamics in what amounts to a supervised learning problem.\nAfterwards, the learned model may be plugged into classical\ntrajectory optimization routines (Tassa et al., 2012; Posa\net al., 2014; Kelly, 2017), which are similarly well-\nunderstood in their original context.\n*Equal contribution1University of California, Berkeley2MIT.\nCorrespondence to: janner@berkeley.edu, yilundu@mit.edu.\nProceedings of the 39thInternational Conference on Machine\nLearning , Baltimore, Maryland, USA, PMLR 162, 2022.\nCopyright 2022 by the author(s).\np\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci)\nq(\u001cij\u001ci\u00001)denoising\ndiffusion\nFigure 1. Diffuser is a diffusion probabilistic model that plans by\niteratively re\ufb01ning trajectories.\nHowever, this combination rarely works as described.\nBecause powerful trajectory optimizers exploit learned\nmodels, plans generated by this procedure often look more\nlike adversarial examples than optimal trajectories (Talvitie,\n2014; Ke et al., 2018). As a result, contemporary model-\nbased reinforcement learning algorithms often inherit more\nfrom model-free Background\nOur approach to planning is a learning-based analogue\nof past work in behavioral synthesis using trajectory\noptimization (Witkin & Kass, 1988; Tassa et al., 2012). In\nthis section, we provide a brief background on the problem\nsetting considered by trajectory optimization and the class\nof generative models we employ for that problem.\n2.1 Problem Setting\nConsider a system governed by the discrete-time dynamics\nst+1=f(st;at)at state stgiven an action at. Trajectory\noptimization refers to \ufb01nding a sequence of actions a\u0003\n0:T\nthat maximizes (or minimizes) an objective Jfactorized\nover per-timestep rewards (or costs) r(st;at):\na\u0003\n0:T= arg max\na0:TJ(s0;a0:T) = arg max\na0:TTX\nt=0r(st;at)\nwhereTis the planning horizon. We use the abbreviation\n\u001c= (s0;a0;s1;a1;:::;sT;aT)to refer to a trajectory\nof interleaved states and actions and J(\u001c)to denote the\nobjective value of that trajectory.\n2.2 Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nDiffusion probabilistic models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015;\nHo et al., 2020) pose the data-generating process as an\niterative denoising procedure p\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci). This denoising\nis the reverse of a forward diffusion process q(\u001cij\u001ci\u00001)\nthat slowly corrupts the structure in data by adding noise.\nThe data distribution induced by the model is given by:\np\u0012(\u001c0) =Z\np(\u001cN)NY\ni=1p\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci)d\u001c1:N\nwherep(\u001cN)is a standard Gaussian prior and \u001c0denotes\n(noiseless) data. Parameters \u0012are optimized by minimizingPlanning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis\na variational bound on the negative log likelihood of the\nreverse process: \u0012\u0003= arg min\u0012\u0000E\u001c0\u0002\nlogp\u0012(\u001c0)\u0003\n:The\nreverse process is often parameterized as Gaussian with\n\ufb01xed timestep-dependent covariances:\np\u0012(\u001ci\u00001j\u001ci) =N(\u001ci\u00001j\u0016\u0012(\u001ci;i);\u0006i):\nThe forward process q(\u001cij\u001ci\u00001)is typically prespeci\ufb01ed.\nNotation. There are two \u201ctimes\u201d at play in this work: that\nof the diffusion process and that of the planning problem.\nWe use superscripts ( iwhen unspeci\ufb01ed) to denote diffusion\ntimestep and subscripts ( twhen unspeci\ufb01ed) to denote\nplanning timestep. For example, s0\ntrefers to thetthstate in a\nnoiseless trajectory. When it is unambiguous from context,\nsuperscripts of noiseless quantities are omitted: \u001c=\u001c0.\nWe overload notation slightly by referring to the tthstate (or\naction) in a trajectory \u001cas\u001cst(or\u001cat).\n3 Planning with Diffusion\nA major obstacle to using trajectory optimization techniques\nis that they require knowledge of the environment dynamics\nf.

While LiDAR sensors provide reliably\naccurate information, existing end-to-end driving solutions are\nmainly based on cameras since processing 3D data requires a\nlarge memory footprint and computation cost. On the other\nhand, increasing the robustness of these systems is also critical;\nhowever, even estimating the model\u2019s uncertainty is very chal-\nlenging due to the cost of sampling-basedmethods can be integrated into an end-to-end learning system\nto execute uncertainty-aware control.\nIII. M ETHODOLOGY\nTraditional end-to-end models perform \u201creactive\u201d control\nfor instantaneous execution. By training the model to addition-\nally predict control commands at steps into the future, we can\nensemble and fuse these predictions once the robot reaches\nthose points, thereby stabilizing control. This paper takes this\nidea even further and intelligently fuses the control predictions\naccording to the model\u2019s uncertainty at each point, in order to\ndeal with sudden unexpected events or an ambiguous future\nenvironment ( i.e., highly uncertain events).\nGiven a raw LiDAR point cloud IL, and a rendered bird\u2019s-\neye view image of the noisy, routed roadmap IM, our objective\nis to learn an end-to-end neural network f\u0012to directly predict\nthe control signals that can drive the vehicle as well as the\ncorresponding epistemic (model) uncertainty.\nf(xk;ek)gK\u00001\nk=0=f\u0012(IL;IM); (1)\nwhere the network outputs Kpredictions, each pair of xk\nandekcorresponding to a control predictions with future\nlookahead distance of k[m] from the current frame: xkis\nthe predicted control value (which can be supervised by the\nrecorded human control yk), and ekare the hyperparameters\nto estimate the uncertainty of this prediction. In principle,\nwe can depend on the current control x0alone to drive the\nvehicle. However, the remaining xk\u2019s withk > 0might\nalso be used to improve the robustness of the model with\nuncertainty-weighted temporal fusion (using ek\u2019s); learning\nthese additional xk\u2019s also provides the model with a sense\nof planning and predicting the future.\nWe illustrate an ef\ufb01cient and robust LiDAR-only end-to-\nend neural network in Figure 2.

These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text\nprompts [ 72,50] or learning useful feature representations [ 14,7]. While these models are already\n\u0003Equal contributionarXiv:2105.05233v4  [cs.LG]  1 Jun 2021capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond\nthe current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic\ndesign, games, music production, and countless other \ufb01elds.\nGANs [ 19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [ 5,68,28] as measured\nby sample quality metrics such as FID [ 23], Inception Score [ 54] and Precision [ 32]. However, some\nof these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity\nthan state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [ 51,43,42]. Furthermore, GANs are often dif\ufb01cult to\ntrain, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4].\nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them dif\ufb01cult to scale and apply to\nnew domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with\nlikelihood-based models [ 51,25,42,9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically\neasier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore,\nexcept for V AEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time.\nDiffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models which have recently been shown to produce\nhigh-quality images [ 56,59,25] while offering desirable properties such as distribution coverage,\na stationary training objective, and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually\nremoving noise from a signal, and their training objective can be expressed as a reweighted variational\nlower-bound [ 25]. This class of models already holds the state-of-the-art [ 60] on CIFAR-10 [ 31], but\nstill lags behind GANs on dif\ufb01cult generation datasets like LSUN and ImageNet. Nichol and Dhariwal\n[43] found that these models improve reliably with increased compute, and can produce high-quality\nsamples even on the dif\ufb01cult ImageNet 256 \u0002256 dataset using an upsampling stack. However, the\nFID of this model is still not competitive with BigGAN-deep [5], the current state-of-the-art on this\ndataset.\nWe hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors:\n\ufb01rst, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and\nre\ufb01ned; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for \ufb01delity, producing high quality samples\nbut not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these bene\ufb01ts to diffusion models, \ufb01rst by\nimproving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for \ufb01delity.\nWith these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different\nmetrics and datasets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse\nimplication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational\ninference to train a Langevin-like sampler.

Some have\nargued that for arti\ufb01cial agents to learn this complex, struc-\ntured process, it is necessary to build in aspects of reason-\ning, such as compositionality (Hu et al. 2017; Johnson et\nal. 2017b) or relational computation (Santoro et al. 2017).\nHowever, if a model made from general-purpose compo-\nnents could learn to visually reason, such an architecture\nwould likely be more widely applicable across domains.\nTo understand if such a general-purpose architecture ex-\nists, we take advantage of the recently proposed CLEVR\ndataset (Johnson et al. 2017a) that tests visual reasoning via\nquestion answering. Examples from CLEVR are shown in\nFigure 1. Visual question answering, the general task of ask-\ning questions about images, has its own line of datasets (Ma-\nlinowski and Fritz 2014; Geman et al. 2015; Antol et al.\n2015) which generally focus on asking a diverse set of\nsimpler questions on images, often answerable in a single\nglance. From these datasets, a number of effective, general-\npurpose deep learning models have emerged for visual ques-\ntion answering (Malinowski, Rohrbach, and Fritz 2015;\nYang et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2017). How-\never, tests on CLEVR show that these general deep learning\napproaches struggle to learn structured, multi-step reason-\ning (Johnson et al. 2017a). In particular, these appendix (Fig-\nures 16 to 18). \rand\fvalues take advantage of a sizable\nrange, varying from -15 to 19 and from -9 to 16, respec-\ntively.\rvalues show a sharp peak at 0, showing that FiLM\nlearns to use the question to shut off or signi\ufb01cantly sup-\npress whole feature maps. Simultaneously, FiLM learns to\nupregulate a much more selective set of other feature maps\nwith high magnitude \rvalues. Furthermore, a large frac-\ntion ( 36%) of\rvalues are negative; since our model uses\na ReLU after FiLM, \r < 0can cause a signi\ufb01cantly differ-\nent set of activations to pass the ReLU to downstream layers\nthan\r > 0. Also, 76% of\fvalues are negative, suggest-\ning that FiLM also uses \fto be selective about which acti-\nvations pass the ReLU. We show later that FiLM\u2019s success\nis largely architecture-agnostic, but examining a particular\nmodel gives insight into the in\ufb02uence FiLM learns to exertFigure 6: t-SNE plots of (\r,\f)of the \ufb01rst (left) and last (right) FiLM layers of a 6-FiLM layer Network.

Together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that FiLM\nlearns to selectively upregulate, downregulate, and shut off\nfeature maps based on conditioning information.\nFiLM Parameters t-SNE Plot In Figure 6, we visualize\nFiLM parameter vectors (\r;\f)for 3,000 random valida-\ntion points with t-SNE. We analyze the deeper, 6-ResBlock\nversion of our model, which has a similar validation accu-\nracy as our 4-ResBlock model, to better examine how FiLM\nlayers in different layers of a hierarchy behave. First and\nlast layer FiLM (\r;\f)are grouped by the low-level and\nhigh-level reasoning functions necessary to answer CLEVR\nquestions, respectively. For example, FiLM parameters for\nequal color andquery color are close for the \ufb01rst\nlayer but apart for the last layer. The same is true for shape,\nsize and material questions. Conversely, equal shape ,\nequal size , and equal material FiLM parameters\nare grouped in the last layer but", " Introduction\nDeep convolutional neural networks [22, 21] have led\nto a series of breakthroughs for image classi\ufb01cation [21,\n50, 40]. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high-\nlevel features [50] and classi\ufb01ers in an end-to-end multi-\nlayer fashion, and the \u201clevels\u201d of features can be enriched\nby the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence\n[41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance,\nand the leading results (Table 14), showing a 64%\nrelative reduction of error. This result won the 1st place in\nthe ImageNet localization task in ILSVRC 2015.\n12 experiments trained\non the training set and evaluated on the test set. Our focus\nis on the behaviors of extremely deep networks, but not on\npushing the state-of-the-art Related Work\nResidual Representations. In image recognition, VLAD\n[18] is a representation that encodes by the residual vectors\nwith respect to a dictionary, and Fisher Vector [30] can be\nformulated as a probabilistic version [18] of VLAD. Both\nof them are powerful shallow representations for image re-\ntrieval and classi\ufb01cation [4, 48]. For vector quantization,\nencoding residual vectors [17] is shown to be more effec-\ntive than encoding original vectors.\nIn low-level vision and computer graphics, for solv-\ning Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the widely used\nMultigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subprob-\nlems at multiple scales, where each subproblem is respon-\nsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a \ufb01ner\nscale. An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis pre-\nconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that repre-\nsent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown\n[3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than stan-\ndard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the\nsolutions. These methods.\nports a center-crop error of 33.1% (Table 13) using ground\ntruth classes. Under the same setting, our RPN method us-\ning ResNet-101 net signi\ufb01cantly reduces the center-crop er-\nror to 13.3%. This comparison demonstrates the excellent\nperformance of our framework. With dense (fully convolu-\ntional) and multi-scale testing, our ResNet-101 has an error\nof 11.7% using ground truth classes. Using ResNet-101 for\npredicting classes (4.6% top-5 classi\ufb01cation error, Table 4),\nthe top-5 localization error is 14.4%.\nThe above introduction, if the added layers can\nbe constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should\nhave training error no greater than its shallower counter-\npart. The degradation problem suggests that the solvers\nmight have dif\ufb01culties in approximating identity mappings\nby multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning re-\nformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers\nmay simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear lay-\ners toward zero to approach identity mappings.\nIn real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are op-\ntimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the\nproblem.

While convolutional networks\nhave already existed for a long time [8], their success was limited due to the\nsize of the available training sets and the size of the considered networks. The\nbreakthrough by Krizhevsky et al. [7] was due to supervised training of a large\nnetwork with 8 layers and millions of parameters on the ImageNet dataset with\n1 million training images. Since then, even larger and deeper networks have been\ntrained [12].\nThe typical use of convolutional networks is on classi\fcation tasks, where\nthe output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks,\nespecially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include\nlocalization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. More-\nover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks.\nHence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict\nthe class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixelarXiv:1505.04597v1  [cs.CV]  18 May 20152\ncopy and cropinput\nimage\ntileoutput \nsegmentation \nmap641\n128\n256\n512\n1024max pool 2x2\nup-conv 2x2conv 3x3, ReLU572 x 572\n284\u00b264\n128\n256\n512570 x 570\n568 x 568\n282\u00b2\n280\u00b2140\u00b2\n138\u00b2\n136\u00b268\u00b2\n66\u00b2\n64\u00b232\u00b2\n28\u00b256\u00b2\n54\u00b2\n52\u00b2512\n104\u00b2\n102\u00b2\n100\u00b2200\u00b230\u00b2\n198\u00b2\n196\u00b2392 x 392\n390 x 390\n388 x 388\n388 x 388\n102451225625612864128642\nconv 1x1\nFig. 1.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1.

The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe success of large pre-trained models in natural language processing (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018), computer vision (Oquab et\u00a0al., 2023), signal processing (Radford et\u00a0al., 2023), among other domains (Jumper et\u00a0al., 2021) across various computing and human benchmarks has brought them to the forefront of the technology-centric world.\nGiven their ability to produce human-expert level responses for a large set of knowledge-based questions (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Achiam et\u00a0al., 2023), the content they produce is often propagated throughout forums that have influence over other models and human users (Brinkmann et\u00a0al., 2023). As such, it is important to develop sufficient frameworks and complementary tools to understand how information produced by these models affects the behavior of other models and human users. We refer to a system where a model can potentially influence other models as a system of interacting language models.\n\n\nBeyond their ability to influence information on human-model forums, systems of interacting language models are interesting in their own right \u2013\ninsofar as an individual model is an intriguing proxy for an individual human (Helm et\u00a0al., 2023; Kosinski, 2023), a system of interacting language models is an intriguing proxy for human communities.\nSystems of interacting language models are thus an alluring alternative or complement to studying human communities in the social sciences.\nFor example, it is often infeasible or unethical to subject entire communities to different information paradigms to understand how individuals within the community \u2013 as well as the community itself \u2013 change in response to an intervention.\nThese issues are less prominent for systems of interacting language models.\nFurther, there is potential for greater control in community membership and cross-community interactions, which may improve reproducibility and mitigate the effects of sociological confounders.\n\n\nIn this paper, we study information diffusion in a system of interacting language models.\nThe framework and methods that we develop can be applied to monitoring information diffusion in human-model forums and to the treatment of systems of interacting language models quantitatively as proxy human communities.\nThe current standard (Perez et\u00a0al., 2024) for studying information diffusion in a system of interacting language models requires i) parameterizing models with different system prompts, contexts, weights, or collections of data, ii) providing an environment or template for model-to-model or model-to-dataset interactions, and iii) analyzing how the outputs of the models change after a sequence of interactions.\n\n\nFor example, researchers include descriptions of desired model behavior or personality in the system prompt \u2013 e.g., \u201cYou have opinion A\u201d is included in the system prompt for model 1 and \u201cYou have opinion B\u201d is included in the system prompt for model 2, etc. \u2013 to promote diversity in model response (Park et\u00a0al., 2023; Chuang et\u00a0al., 2023; Papachristou & Yuan, 2024).\nWhile the intended model response diversity is achieved, previous studies have failed to quantitatively assess the effect of different model initializations and, instead, rely on qualitative checks.\nSimilarly, analyzing changes in model responses as the system evolves has previously been limited to human inspection of responses (Park et\u00a0al., 2023),\nor classification of responses into a few classes (Chuang et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nWe introduce the perspective space of a collection of models to address the gap in quantitative methods for studying the", " Introduction\nWe endeavor to fill a gap in the current literature on embedding pairwise dissimilarity\ndata in Euclidean space. Whereas the vast literature on multidimensional scaling\n(MDS) is almost entirely concerned with embedding dissimilarity data for a fixed\nnumber of objects, various modern applications are concerned with situations in which\nthe number of objects tends to infinity. For example:\n\u2022Manifold learning studies the recovery of data manifolds. Much of the current\ntheory offers guarantees that hold asymptotically, as the manifold is sampled\nmore and more extensively. If recovery means representation in Euclidean space,\nthen it is natural to inquire how the representations behave asymptotically.\n\u2022Network science frequently studies the behavior of graphs with increasing num-\nbers of vertices. Upon constructing the matrix of pairwise dissimilarities be-\ntween the vertices of a graph, the problem of embedding that graph in Eu-\nclidean space (here referred to as graph embedding , although the same phrase\nhas also been used in other contexts) reduces to the problem of MDS. Again,\nit is natural to inquire how the Euclidean representations of the graphs behave\nasymptotically.\nThe preceding examples coalesce in the manifold learning technique known as\nIsomap [9], the study of which motivated the present inquiry. Isomap posits data\nthat lie on a compact connected Riemannian manifold and consists of three distinct\nsteps: (1) constructing a graph that summarizes the local structure of the data; (2)\ncomputing the shortest path distances between the vertices; and (3) embedding the\nshortest path distances by MDS. Several researchers [1, 10] have studied the conver-\ngence of the shortest path distances to the corresponding Riemannian distances as\nsampling of the manifold increases. Here, we develop tools for examining the asymp-\ntotic behavior of the pairwise Euclidean distances in the embedded configuration.\nThe development that follows assumes that embedding is accomplished by finding\na global minimizer of Kruskal\u2019s [7] raw stress criterion. Similar Discussion\nAlthough we believe that our formulation of continuous MDS in Section 4 is of general\ninterest, the work described herein was motivated by our study of random dot product\ngraphs (RDPGs). See [11] and the appendix.\nWe apply elementary Appendix: Computation\nFixnand \u2206, and consider the unconstrained optimization problem of finding an n\u00d7d\nconfiguration matrix Zthat minimizes (2). A standard approach to unconstrained\noptimization begins with identifying solutions of the stationary equation, i.e., the\nequation that requires all partial derivatives of the objective function to vanish. A\npopular approach to minimizing (2) exploits the special structure of its stationary\nequation.\nLetGdenote an undirected graph with vertices 1 , . . . , n . Ifwij=wji>0, then\nvertices iandjare connected with edge weight wij.

Then it turns out that the\nstationary equation for minimizing (2) can be written as LZ=M(Z)Z.\nThe equation LZ=M(Z)Zsuggests an iterative method for finding stationary\nconfigurations: given a configuration Zk, solve the linear system LZ=M(Zk)Zkto\nobtain a new configuration Zk+1.

(2021).\n\n\nAn ideal model comparison methodology would surface exactly the set of data that differs between two models.\nThis would enable practitioners to discover systematic differences between the models being compared, without having to define a metric which captures those differences a priori.\nTowards this end, we propose a framework for directly comparing the geometry of the embedding spaces learned by different models on a per-datum basis.\nThe framework enables, for the first time, a comparison of the representations learned by foundation models that is agnostic to any particular performance metric.\nWe test our framework using a controlled training data ablation experiment, and find that it is able to surface changes in the representations of documents corresponding to the ablated class.\n\n\nDue to the already large and continually increasing size of the foundation model design space, an ideal model comparison would also facilitate population level model comparison.\nAccordingly, we demonstrate how to extend our framework to enable multi-model comparison by inducing a manifold of models.\nWe find that the distance between two models on this manifold is correlated strongly with the similarity of their performance on downstream tasks.\nIn future work, we aim to scale our population level comparison methodology to induce an empirical manifold of models.\nSuch a manifold would allow practitioners to frame model evaluation as a taxonomic problem, and generalize findings about the performance of a particular model to the performance of a family of models.\n\n\nNotation.\nWe use lower case letters for vectors, upper case letters for matrices, \u2225\u22c5\u22252\\|\\cdot\\|_{2}\u2225 \u22c5 \u2225 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to denote the Euclidean norm on vectors, and \u2225\u22c5\u2225S\\|\\cdot\\|_{S}\u2225 \u22c5 \u2225 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for the spectral norm on matrices.

We design a\nTransformer generation algorithm where\na tree search algorithm is used to perform\nlookahead planning. The tree search al-\ngorithm alone may not be able to \ufb01nd\nhigh-quality codes due to the large search\nspace. So the conventional Transformer\nbeam search algorithm and the next-token\nprobabilities provided by the pre-trained\nTransformer are used by the tree search\nalgorithm to guide the search process.\nWe provide the pseudocode of our\nPlanning-Guided Transformer Decoding\nalgorithm (PG-TD) in Algorithm 1 and\nillustrate the whole process in Figure 2.\nThe PG-TD algorithm follows the same\nframework as the standard MCTS algo-\nrithm, based on the implementation used\nin Silver et al. (2017). Here, we focus on\nhow the Transformer is used in the tree\nsearch steps. We provide more details of\nour algorithm in Sec. D.1.\nIn the selection step, we follow Silver et al. (2017) and use the P-UCB algorithm to select which\nbranch of the tree we want to explore. In P-UCB, we weigh the exploration term by the probability of\nthe next tokens determined by the Transformer. So the tree search selects higher-probability tokens\nmore often. The selection algorithm is parameterized by an exploration parameter, c, where a higher\ncvalue leads to more exploration. We describe the details of P-UCB in Sec. D.1.\nIn the expansion step, after a node in the tree is selected, we select the possible next tokens and add\nthe corresponding next states as new nodes to its children list (for succinctness, a node also refers\nto the state that it represents). Sampling a random token as in the standard MCTS may very likely\ncause a syntax error. So we call TOP Kto get the most likely next tokens, where TOP K(s;k)returns\nthekmost likely next tokens starting from s;kis the maximum number of children that any node\nmay have. The corresponding knext states are the concatenations of the current state with each of\n5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nthe next tokens suggested by the Transformer. These next states are added to the children list of the\ncurrent node. (Line 9-14)\nIn the evaluation step, we need to evaluate the selected node . Note thatnode may still be a partial\nprogram. We cannot directly evaluate the quality of a partial program as we do not know how it\nwill be completed and how many test cases it will pass. Here, we use the Transformer again by\ncalling the BEAM SEARCH function to generate a complete program from the current node, where\nBEAM SEARCH (s;b)generates a sequence using the Transformer beam search algorithm with the\npre\ufb01xsand beam size b. We run the generated program on the public test cases to get its reward,\nand set it to be the value of node (Line 16-17). This value is backpropagated up in the tree so that\nthe values of its ancestors are updated (Line 20).\na,ba,ca,,<PD>axa=x,ax=,a,b,a,b=a,c=a,c,\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026a,,<PD>axa=x,ax=,a,b,a,b=a,bIteration tIteration t+1\nFigure 3: Illustration for caching in\nthe PG-TD algorithm.

Our\nintuition is simple: learn what the world looks like and how it is described from\npaired text-image data, and learn how the world moves from unsupervised video\nfootage. Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the\nT2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from\nscratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated\nvideos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.)\nof today\u2019s image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to\nbuild on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules. First, we\ndecompose the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximate them\nin space and time. Second, we design a spatial temporal pipeline to generate\nhigh resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model\nand two super resolution models that can enable various applications besides\nT2V . In all aspects, spatial and temporal resolution, faithfulness to text, and\nquality, Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation,\nas determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Internet has fueled collecting billions of (alt-text, image) pairs from HTML pages (Schuhmann\net al., 2022), enabling the recent breakthroughs in Text-to-Image (T2I) modeling. However, repli-\ncating this success for videos is limited since a similarly sized (text, video) dataset cannot be easily\ncollected. It would be wasteful to train Text-to-Video (T2V) models from scratch when there already\nexist models that can generate images. Moreover, unsupervised learning enables networks to learn\nfrom orders of magnitude more data. This large quantity of data is important to learn representa-\ntions of more subtle, less common concepts in the world. Unsupervised learning has long had great\nsuccess in advancing the \ufb01eld of natural language processing (NLP) (Liu et al., 2019a; Brown et al.,\n2020). Models pre-trained this way yield considerably higher performance than when solely trained\nin a supervised manner.\nInspired by these motivations, we propose Make-A-Video. Make-A-Video leverages T2I models\nto learn the correspondence between text and the visual world, and uses unsupervised learning on\nunlabeled (unpaired) video data, to learn realistic motion. Together, Make-A-Video generates videos\nfrom text without leveraging paired text-video data.\nClearly, text describing images does not capture the entirety of phenomena observed in videos. That\nsaid, one can often infer actions and events from static images (e.g. a woman drinking coffee, or an\n+Core Contributors. Corresponding author: urielsinger@meta.com .

Manipulating images in an open domain context was first proposed by the\nseminal Open-Edit [26], which allowed text prompts to alter an image\u2019s content.\nThis was done mostly with semantically simple transformations (e.g., turn a red\napple green), and does not allow generation of images. Soon after DALL-E [41]\nand GLIDE [36] were developed, both of which can perform generation (and\ninpainting) from arbitrary text prompts, but do not themselves enable image\nmanipulation.\nIn this work we propose the first a unified approach to semantic image gener-\nation and editing, leveraging a pretrained joint image-text encoder [40] to steer\nan image generative model [12]. Our methodology works by using the multimodal\nencoder to define a loss function evaluating the similarity of a (text, image) pair\nand backpropagating to the latent space of the image generator. We iteratively\n\u22c6Co-first authorsarXiv:2204.08583v2  [cs.CV]  4 Sep 20222 K Crowson, S Biderman et al.\nupdate the candidate generation until it is sufficiently similar to the target text.\nThe difference between using our technique for generation and editing is merely\na matter of initializing the generator with a particular image (for editing) or\nwith random noise (for generation).\nA significant advantage of our methodology is the lack of additional training\nrequired. Only a pretrained image generator and a joint image-text encoder are\nnecessary, while all three of Liu et al. [26], Ramesh et al. [41], and Nichol et al.\n[36] require training similar models from scratch. Additionally Ramesh et al. [41]\nand Nichol et al. [36] train generators from scratch.\nWe demonstrate several significant contributions, including:\n1. High visual quality for both generation and manipulation of images.\n2. High semantic fidelity between text and generation, especially when seman-\ntically unlikely content co-occurs.\n3. Efficiency in that our method requires no additional training beyond the pre-\ntrained models, using only a small amount of optimization per inference.\n4. The value of open development and research. This technique was developed\nin public and open collaboration has been integral to its rapid real-world\nsuccess. Non-authors have already extended our approach to other modalities\n(e.g., replacing text for audio) and commercial applications.\nThe rest of our manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss\nhow of how our methodology works, resulting in a simple and easy-to-apply\napproach for combing multiple modalities for generation or manipulation. The\nefficacy of vqgan-clip in generating high quality and semantically relevant\nimages is shown in Section 3, followed by superior manipulation ability in Sec-\ntion 4. The design choices of vqgan-clip to obtain both high image quality and\nfast generation are validated by ablations in Section 5, and Section 6 discusses\nresource usage and efficiency considerations. As our approach has been public\nsince April 2021, we are able to show further validation by external groups in\nSection 7. This use includes extensions to other modalities, showing the flexibil-\nity of our approach, as well as commercial use of vqgan-clip that demonstrate\nits success at handling open-domain prompts and images to a satisfying degree.\nFinally we conclude in Section 8.\n2 Our Methodology\nTo demonstrate our method\u2019s effectiveness we apply it using VQGAN [12] and\nCLIP [40] as pre-trained models, and so refer to our approach as vqgan-clip", " Introduction\nSuccessfulnon-invasiveBrain-ComputerInterfaces(BCI)requiresolvingahighdimensional,highfrequencyprediction\nproblem.

This is particularlytrue forpassive tasks\nsuch as cognitive load and stress prediction where associated labels are not trial based and relatively \u201cweak\".\nThe most common approach to passive, non-invasive EEG-based BCI predictive tasks is to leverage neuroscienti\ufb01cally\nrelevant features from the waveforms from each of the channels. For example, the alpha band (8-12 Hz) is known to be\nmore active in stressed individuals and the theta (4-7 Hz) and low beta (13-20 Hz) bands are known to be active in\nfatigued persons.

However, the choice of di\ufb00erent sensors to measure coupling strength is\nhighly subjective and require neurophysiological a priori knowledge.

These approaches derive the kernel on the Riemannian space using the average\ncorrelation matrix for a particular class.

In generative\nmodels, the information about the input is typically dis-\ntributed over multiple hidden states of the model.

However, learning such a\nrepresentation (or embedding) is necessary for many tasks.\nSystems that search over millions or billions of items re-\nquire each entry to be embedded as a dense representation\nand build an index in advance to save computational costs\nat query time. These embeddings are useful features for\nclassi\ufb01cation tasks and can also enable data visualization\napplications via techniques such as clustering. Embedding\nmodels are explicitly optimized to learn a low dimensional\nrepresentation that captures the semantic meaning of the\ninput (Radford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021; Giorgi et al.,\n2020; Gao et al., 2021; Izacard et al., 2021).arXiv:2201.10005v1  [cs.CL]  24 Jan 2022Text and Code Embeddings by Contrastive Pre-Training\nIn this work, we train embedding models using a con-\ntrastive learning objective with in-batch negatives (Sohn,\n2016; Yih et al., 2011) on unlabeled data. The input is en-\ncoded with a Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017)\nand we leverage naturally occurring paired data to con-\nstruct training data with no explicit labels. Text embedding\nmodels are trained on paired text data where we consider\nneighboring pieces of text on the Internet as positive pairs.\nCode embedding models treat the top-level docstring in a\nfunction along with its implementation as a (text, code)\npair. The training signal of the contrastive objective on\nits own is not suf\ufb01cient to learn useful representations and\nwe overcome this by initializing our model with other pre-\ntrained models (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021).

In order to control for this effect, we searched for long common substrings\nbetween the input examples (presented in prompted form) for our zero-shot test tasks on one hand,\nand documents in C4 (our model\u2019s pretraining set) on the other hand.\nIn order to do this effectively, we use the suf\ufb01x array method described and implemented in Lee\net al. (2021) to index C4, allowing us to run fast counts of how many times a substring appears in\nthe corpus. To limit the number of queries, we search by partitioning sentences into groups of 16\ntokens and doing an exact match query. This gives us an over-counting on how many length-32 token\noverlaps there are in the corpus. We \ufb02ag examples that produce a match during that procedure, then\nmanually inspect them.\nFor NLI datasets, we separate matches for premises and hypotheses since, the premises tend to be\nsourced from the internet and therefore have a high number of matches.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speci\ufb01c architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\ntask-speci\ufb01c architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\nbeen directly \ufb01ne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speci\ufb01c architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speci\ufb01c datasets and task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne-tuning: to achieve\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires \ufb01ne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\nof examples speci\ufb01c to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an Results for SAT task.\n Figure H.3: All Related Work\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speci\ufb01cally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass.

Researchers have started to input indi-\nvidual sentences into BERT and to derive \ufb01xed-\nsize sentence embeddings. The most commonly\nused approach is to average the BERT output layer\n(known as BERT embeddings) or by using the out-\nput of the \ufb01rst token (the [CLS] token). As we\nwill show, this common practice yields rather bad\nsentence embeddings, often worse than averaging\nGloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014).\nTo alleviate this issue, we developed SBERT.\nThe siamese network architecture enables that\n\ufb01xed-sized vectors for input sentences can be de-\nrived. Using a similarity measure like cosine-\nsimilarity or Manhatten / Euclidean distance, se-\nmantically similar sentences can be found.

Methods in Natural Language Process-\ning, pages 1631\u20131642,", " Introduction\nGraphs, or networks, are a mathematical representation of data that consists of discrete objects (nodes\nor vertices) and relationships between these objects (edges). For example, in a brain, regions of in-\nterest can be vertices, the edges represent the presence of a structural connection between them [1].\nSince graphs necessarily deal with relationships between nodes, classical statistical assumptions about\nindependence are violated. Thus, novel methodology is required for performing statistical inference on\ngraphs and populations of graphs [2]. While the theory for inference on graphs is highly developed, to\ndate, there has not existed a numerical package implementing these methods for embedding a single graph [2]. Omnibus embedding and mul-\ntiple adjacency spectral embedding (MASE) allows for embedding multiple graphs into the same\nsubspace such that the embeddings can be meaningfully compared [9, 10]. GraSPy includes a\nmethod for choosing the number of embedding dimensions automatically [11].\nModels GraSPy includes classes for \ufb01tting random graph models to an input graph (Figure 2). Cur-\nrently, ER, SBM, DCER, DCSBM, and RDPG are supported for model estimation. After \ufb01tting\na model to data, the model class can also output goodness-of-\ufb01t metrics (mean squared error,\nlikelihood) and the number of estimated model parameters, allowing for model selection. The\nmodel classes can also be used to sample new simulated graphs based on the \ufb01t model.\nInference Given two graphs, a natural question to ask is whether these graphs are both random\nsamples from the same generative distribution. GraSPy provides two types of test for this null\nhypothesis: a latent position test and a latent distribution test. Both tests are framed under the\nRDPG model, where the generative distribution for the graph can be modeled as a set of latent\npositions. The latent position test can only be performed on two graphs of the same size and with\nknown correspondence between the vertices of the two graphs [13]. The latent distribution test\ncan be performed on graphs without vertex alignment, or even with slightly different numbers of\nvertices [14].\nCluster GraSPy extends Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and k-means from scikit-learn to\nsweep over a speci\ufb01ed range of parameters and choose the best clustering [15]. The number\nof clusters and covariance structure for each GMM is chosen by Bayesian information criterion\n(BIC), which is a penalized likelihood function to evaluate the quality of estimators [16]. Silhouette\nscore is used to choose the number of clusters for k-means [17]. Clustering is often useful for\ncomputing the the community structure of vertices after embedding.\nPlotGraSPy extends seaborn to visualize graphs as adjacency matrices and embedded graphs as\npaired scatter plots [18]. Individual graphs can be visualized using heatmap function, and multiple\ngraphs can be overlaid on top of each other using gridplot. The nodes in both graph visualizations\ncan be sorted by various node metadata, such as node degree or assigned node labels. Pairplot\ncan visualize high dimensional data, such as embeddings, as a pairwise scatter plot.\n3IER RDPG DCSBM\nDCER SBM ERK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nI\nK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nIK P OI\nK\nP\nO\nI\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nFigure 2: Connectome model \ufb01tting using GraSPy .

Modern TTS systems\nare based on complex, multi-stage processing pipelines,\neach of which may rely on hand-engineered features and\nheuristics. Due to this complexity, developing new TTS\nsystems can be very labor intensive and dif\ufb01cult.\nDeep V oice is inspired by traditional text-to-speech\npipelines and adopts the same structure, while replacing all\ncomponents with neural networks and using simpler fea-\ntures: \ufb01rst we convert text to phoneme and then use an\naudio synthesis model to convert linguistic features into\nspeech (Taylor, 2009). Unlike prior work (which uses\nhand-engineered features such as spectral envelope, spec-\ntral parameters, aperiodic parameters, etc.), our only fea-\ntures are phonemes with stress annotations, phoneme du-\nrations, and fundamental frequency (F0). This choice of\nfeatures makes our system more readily applicable to new\ndatasets, voices, and domains without any manual data an-\nnotation or additional feature engineering. We demonstrate\nthis claim by retraining our entire pipeline without any hy-\nperparameter changes on an entirely new dataset that con-\ntains solely audio and unaligned textual transcriptions and\ngenerating relatively high quality speech. In a conventional\nTTS system this adaptation requires days to weeks of tun-\ning, whereas Deep V oice allows you to do it in only a few\nhours of manual effort and the time it takes models to train.arXiv:1702.07825v2  [cs.CL]  7 Mar 2017Deep Voice: Real-time Neural TTS\nReal-time inference is a requirement for a production-\nquality TTS system; without it, the system is unusable for\nmost applications of TTS. Prior work has demonstrated that\na WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016) can generate close to\nhuman-level speech. However, WaveNet inference poses a\ndaunting computational problem due to the high-frequency,\nautoregressive nature of the model, and it has been hitherto\nunknown whether such models can be used in a produc-\ntion system. We answer this question in the af\ufb01rmative and\ndemonstrate ef\ufb01cient, faster-than-real-time WaveNet infer-\nence kernels that produce high-quality 16 kHz audio and\nrealize a 400X speedup over previous WaveNet inference\nimplementations (Paine et al., 2016).\n2. Related Work\nPrevious work uses neural networks as substitutes for\nseveral TTS system components, including grapheme-to-\nphoneme conversion models (Rao et al., 2015; Yao &\nZweig, 2015), phoneme duration prediction models (Zen\n& Sak, 2015), fundamental frequency prediction models\n(Pascual & Bonafonte, 2016; Ronanki et al., 2016), and\naudio synthesis models (van den Oord et al., 2016; Mehri\net al., 2016). Unlike Deep V oice, however, none of these\nsystems solve the entire problem of TTS and many of them\nuse specialized hand-engineered features developed specif-\nically for their domain.\nMost recently, there has been a lot of work in paramet-\nric audio synthesis, notably WaveNet, SampleRNN, and\nChar2Wav (van den Oord et al., 2016; Mehri et al., 2016;\nSotelo et al., 2017). While WaveNet can be used for\nboth conditional and unconditional audio generation, Sam-\npleRNN is only used for unconditional audio generation.\nChar2Wav extends SampleRNN with an attention-based\nphoneme duration model and the equivalent of an F0 pre-\ndiction model, effectively providing local conditioning in-\nformation to a SampleRNN-based vocoder.\nDeep V oice differs from these systems in several key as-\npects that notably increase the scope of the problem. First,\nDeep V oice is completely standalone; training a new Deep\nV oice", " Introduction\nMany current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\nity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In\nmachine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words\nor less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in\nany signi\ufb01cant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\nWith progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more\ncomplex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably\nthe most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [10]. For example, neural\nnetwork based language models signi\ufb01cantly outperform N-gram models [1, 27, 17].\n1.1 Goals of the Paper\nThe main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word\nvectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary. As\nfar as we know, none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more\n1arXiv:1301.3781v3  [cs.CL]  7 Sep 2013than a few hundred of millions of words, with a modest dimensionality of the word vectors between\n50 - 100.\nWe use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representa-\ntions, with the expectation that not only will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that\nwords can have multiple degrees of similarity [20]. This has been observed earlier in the context\nof in\ufb02ectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for\nsimilar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to \ufb01nd words that have similar\nendings [13, 14].\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple\nsyntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are per-\nformed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(\u201dKing\u201d) - vector(\u201dMan\u201d) + vec-\ntor(\u201dWoman\u201d) experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also\ninteresting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [30] and others. We believe that\nour comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for\nestimating the word vectors. We also expect that high quality word vectors will become an important\nbuilding block for future NLP applications.\n107 Follow-Up Work\nAfter the initial version of this paper was written, we published single-machine multi-threaded C++\ncode for computing the word vectors, using both the continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram archi-\ntectures4.

In the context of reconstructing 3D avatars, the ability to explicitly control the motions of the avatar in post processing becomes imperative.\nMost existing methods for reconstructing animatable avatars drive the animation through an underlying skeleton using linear blending skinning (LBS) [64], which adequately models the dynamics of humans dressed in tight-fitting clothes\u00a0[99, 7, 80, 23, 119, 1]. With this approach, garments are treated as a rigidly attached part of the body adhering to piece-wise linear transformations, which results in motions that appear rigid and unconvincing in many cases\u00a0[79, 134, 120]. Several successful attempts to introduce non-rigid deformations through pose-dependent geometry adjustments, such as wrinkles, have recently been made\u00a0[60, 59, 114, 57, 18], although these methods are prone to overfitting to the body poses and motion sequences observed during training. A key problem is that most existing 3D avatar reconstruction approaches neglect to model the dynamics of loose garments in a physically accurate manner, leading to unrealistic fabric behavior and issues like self-penetration. To our knowledge, only the work of Xiang et al.\u00a0[118] includes a physics-based approach to inverse rendering of digital humans, but their approach requires a tedious manual search process to find the parameters that model the dynamic behavior of their cloth fabrics with reasonable accuracy.\n\n\nHere, we introduce PhysAvatar, a novel approach to 3D avatar reconstruction from multi-view video data. PhysAvatar combines inverse rendering with \u201cinverse physics\u201d in a principled manner to not only estimate the shape and appearance of the avatar but also physical parameters, including density and stiffness, of the fabrics modeling their (loose) clothes. Our approach includes several parts:\nGiven the reconstructed 3D mesh of the garment in one frame, we first leverage mesh-aligned 4D Gaussians\u00a0[117] to track surface points of the garment across all frames of the input video sequence. This process establishes dense correspondences on the 3D garment. These data are used as supervision in an inverse physics step, where the physical parameters of the fabric are optimized using a finite-difference approach\u00a0[123, 50].\nFinally, we employ a physically based inverse renderer\u00a0[78] to jointly estimate ambient lighting and the surface material. By leveraging the refined geometry from our simulation step, the inverse renderer can effectively factor in pose-dependent effects, such as", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Based on the SMPL mesh and its UV mapping, we learn pose-dependent refined mesh and its Gaussian textures. By combining the advantages of high-quality rendering from Gaussian Splatting and easy animation of template mesh, our method could produce photo-realistic human avatars.\n\n\nReconstructing high-fidelity and photo-realistic human avatars has long been a significant topic in the fields of computer vision and computer graphics, with various applications in games, movies, and virtual/augmented reality. Traditional human modeling requires a time-consuming and tedious pipeline involving modeling, rigging, and skinning, yet it remains challenging to create photo-realistic avatars.\n\n\nEarly works\u00a0[19, 24] often employ explicit mesh representations to depict 3D human bodies, commonly utilizing parametric mesh models such as SMPL\u00a0[29] and SMPL-X\u00a0[38].\nTypically, these approaches involve regressing low-dimensional model parameters to accurately align model projections with the images.\nOwing to the low-dimensional nature of the parametric space, these methods are incapable of capturing clothing wrinkles and detailed textures. Subsequent efforts\u00a0[4, 3, 2, 7, 5, 30] have extended parametric models by incorporating vertex displacements to represent clothing, improving the ability to express geometric variations. However, they are still constrained by the fixed topological structure of parametric models, making it difficult to represent complex and detailed structures.\n\n\nWith the development of implicit representations, an increasing number of studies have started to introduce these representations for 3D human modeling, such as Signed Distance Functions (SDF)\u00a0[36] and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)\u00a0[32]. Neural Body first applies the NeRF representation to human modeling, demonstrating promising results at that time. Subsequently, a significant amount of work\u00a0[40, 39, 46, 14, 47, 50, 9, 26] has been explored to utilize NeRF representation for human modeling. Many of them learn to transform the points in observation space to canonical space and establish NeRF in canonical space to achieve animation. However, the NeRF-based methods, while achieving high-quality results, are computationally intensive and time-consuming due to the requirements for intensive inference of the MLP network, thus constraining their usage.\n\n\nRecently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\u00a0[21] has attracted significant attention. Building upon traditional point-based rendering methods, 3DGS has significantly enhanced rendering quality and enables real-time rendering. Researchers have started exploring the use of 3D Gaussians to represent 3D human avatars. Approaches such as 3DGS-Avatar\u00a0[41] and GauHuman\u00a0[16] initialize Gaussians using points sampled from the SMPL model, then employ supervised learning on monocular image sequences to optimize the Gaussian points\u2019 features, striking a promising balance between real-time performance and rendering quality. Concurrently, the initiatives of Animatable Gaussians\u00a0[27], GaussianAvatar\u00a0[15], and ASH\u00a0[35] have ventured into learning Gaussian features from 2D images, allowing for the leveraging of powerful 2D networks to model realistic human models. Animatable Gaussians, for instance, utilizes two position maps (front and back views) as network inputs but overlooks the unique characteristics of facial and hand regions, which, although comprising a few pixels, entail intricate textures. In contrast, GaussianAvatar employs the SMPL model as the guidance which may fail to model detailed structure movements effectively.\n\n\nHence, we propose UV Gaussians, which amalgamate the effortless animation of parametric mesh models with the high-quality rendering of 3DGS. Instead of directly using the SMPL mesh as the", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDiffusion models create data from noise\u00a0(Song et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThey are trained to\ninvert forward paths of data towards random noise and, thus, in\nconjunction with approximation and generalization properties of neural networks, can be used to generate new data points that are not present in the training data but follow the distribution of the training data\u00a0(Sohl-Dickstein et\u00a0al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2020). This generative modeling technique has proven to be very effective for modeling high-dimensional, perceptual data such as images\u00a0(Ho et\u00a0al., 2020). In recent years, diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating high-resolution images and videos from natural language inputs with impressive generalization capabilities\u00a0(Saharia et\u00a0al., 2022b; Ramesh et\u00a0al., 2022; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022; Podell et\u00a0al., 2023; Dai et\u00a0al., 2023; Esser et\u00a0al., 2023; Blattmann et\u00a0al., 2023b; Betker et\u00a0al., 2023; Blattmann et\u00a0al., 2023a; Singer et\u00a0al., 2022). Due to their iterative nature and the associated computational costs, as well as the long sampling times during inference, research on formulations for more efficient training and/or faster sampling of these models has increased\u00a0(Karras et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nWhile specifying a forward path from data to noise leads to efficient training, it also raises the question of which path to choose.\nThis choice can have important implications for sampling. For example, a forward process that fails to remove all noise from the data can lead to a discrepancy in training and test distribution and result in artifacts such as gray image samples\u00a0(Lin et\u00a0al., 2024).\nImportantly, the choice of the forward process also influences the learned backward process and, thus, the sampling efficiency. While curved paths require many integration steps to simulate the process, a straight path could be simulated with a single step and is less prone to error accumulation. Since each step corresponds to an evaluation of the neural network, this has a direct impact on the sampling speed.\n\n\nA particular choice for the forward path is a so-called Rectified Flow\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2022; Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2022; Lipman et\u00a0al., 2023), which connects data and noise on a straight line. Although this model class has better theoretical properties, it has not yet become decisively established in practice. So far, some advantages have been empirically demonstrated in small and medium-sized experiments\u00a0(Ma et\u00a0al., 2024), but these are mostly limited to class-conditional models.\nIn this work, we change this by introducing a re-weighting of the noise scales in rectified flow models, similar to noise-predictive diffusion models\u00a0(Ho et\u00a0al., 2020). Through a large-scale study, we compare our new formulation to existing diffusion formulations and demonstrate its benefits.\n\n\nWe show that the widely used approach for text-to-image synthesis, where a fixed text representation is fed directly into the model (e.g., via cross-attention\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022)), is not ideal, and present a new architecture that incorporates learnable streams for both image and text tokens, which enables a two-way flow of information between them.\nWe combine this with our improved rectified flow formulation and investigate its scalability.\nWe demonstrate a predictable scaling trend in the validation loss and show that a lower validation loss correlates strongly with improved automatic and human evaluations.\n\n\nOur largest models outperform state-of-the art open models such as", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecently, we have observed the emergence of several promising methods for rendering unseen views of 3D objects and scenes using neural networks. For instance, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020) have rapidly grown in popularity within the computer vision and graphics communities (Gao et\u00a0al., 2022) as they enable the creation of high-quality renders. Despite this interest and growing body of related research, the long training and inference time remains an unsolved challenge for NeRFs.\n\n\nIn contrast, latterly introduced Gaussian Splatting (GS)\u00a0(Kerbl et\u00a0al., 2023) offers swift training and real-time rendering capabilities. What is unique to this method is that it represents 3D objects using Gaussian distributions (i.e. Gaussians). Hence, it does not rely on any neural network. Consequently, Gaussians can be employed in a manner akin to manipulating 3D point clouds or meshes, allowing for actions like resizing or repositioning in 3D space. Nonetheless, practical challenges may arise when altering Gaussian positions, particularly in accurately tracking changes in the shape of Gaussian components, such as the ellipses. Moreover, scaling Gaussian components proves challenging when the object undergoes resizing, which is not an issue for classical meshes, as their triangle faces can be readily updated when vertex positions are adjusted.\n\n\nThe above constraints may be resolved by constructing Gaussian directly on the mesh, as shown by SuGaR\u00a0(Gu\u00e9don & Lepetit, 2023). Here, the authors introduced a regularization term in the Gaussian splat cost function to promote optimal alignment of the Gaussians with the scene\u2019s surface. The SuGaR model uses signed distance functions (SDF) from the vanilla GS and minimizes the difference between this SDF and its actual value computed for the Gaussians. Moreover, the authors propose a method for extracting mesh from the GS model and introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds Gaussians to the surface of the mesh and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through GS rendering.\n\n\nFigure 2: GaMeS can be effectively trained on large scenes to allow their modifications while preserving high-quality renders.\n\n\n\nIn our paper, we propose an alternative approach to such a task. Unlike SuGaR, we do not have two expensive stages dedicated to producing high-quality mesh. Instead, our Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) uses existing mesh or approximates it during one-stage training. Our estimated mesh uses a set of triangle faces, which are not connected; therefore, we called it pseudo-mesh. Our pseudo-mesh is dedicated to modifying the GS model, not approximating objects\u2019 surfaces. Implementing GaMeS involves positioning Gaussian components on the faces of the pseudo-mesh, ensuring proper alignment of these components with the mesh structure.\nUsing our method, we can obtain comparable to state-of-the-art high-quality outcomes that can be attained for static scenes akin to the GS method. Moreover, any alterations to the mesh will automatically propagate updates to the corresponding Gaussian components, enabling real-time animation (see Fig.\u00a01). Such an approach can also be applied in scenarios with preexisting mesh (see Fig.\u00a02). Most importantly, we can train GS and then generate pseudo-mesh from Gaussian components to force a model to be editable. In such a strategy, our pseudo-mesh is not dedicated to describing the object\u2019s surface but to editing", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDigital avatars play an essential role in numerous applications, from augmented and virtual reality to gaming, movie production, and synthetic data generation\n\u00a0[54, 8, 52, 21, 20, 53, 36, 45].\nHowever, highly realistic and animatable avatars are extremely difficult to create at scale due to the complexity and diversity of character geometries and appearances. Traditional approaches rely on manual modeling and rigging of digital avatars, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming.\nRecent advances in text-to-image generative models trained on large-scale data show impressive results in generating highly diverse and realistic human images from text\u00a0[34, 35, 6, 49].\nIn light of this, several methods are proposed to generate 3D avatars from textual descriptions by distilling the 2D prior of these generative models into 3D avatar representations\u00a0[9, 18, 11].\nWhile their results are promising, the quality of the generated avatars is limited by the 3D representations they use, which are typically based on mesh or neural radiance field (NeRF)\u00a0[28].\nMesh-based representations allow efficient rendering through rasterization, but the expressiveness to capture diverse geometry and fine details is limited due to the underlying topology. NeRF-based representations are expressive in modeling complex 3D scenes, but they are computationally expensive due to the large number of samples required by volume rendering to produce high-resolution images.\nAs a result, existing avatar generation methods often fail to both generate fine-grained, out-of-shape geometric details, such as loose clothing, and efficiently render high-resolution avatars, which are critical for interactive and dynamic applications.\n\n\nWe aim to address these issues by adopting a new 3D representation, 3D Gaussian Splatting\u00a0[17], which represents a scene using a set of 3D Gaussians with color, opacity, scales, and rotations and produces rendering by differentiably splatting the Gaussians onto an image. Gaussian splatting combines the advantages of both mesh and NeRF-based representations and it is both efficient and flexible to capture fine details.\nHowever, naive applications of Gaussian splatting to avatar generation fail for several reasons due to the unconstrained nature of individual Gaussians. First, the Gaussian splatting representation is not animatable, as the Gaussians are defined in the world coordinate and cannot be easily transformed with the avatar\u2019s pose in a coherent manner. Second, a large number (millions) of Gaussians are required to model a highly detailed avatar, and the immense optimization space of individual Gaussian attributes (e.g., color, opacity, scale, rotation) leads to unstable optimization, especially when using high-variance objectives such as SDS\u00a0[30]. Third, the 3D Gaussians lack explicit knowledge of surfaces, and cannot easily incorporate surface normal supervision, which is crucial for extracting highly detailed 3D meshes\u00a0[4, 10]. Without geometry supervision, missing or degenerate body parts can appear when using weak 3D supervision (i.e., SDS), which we will show in the experiments.\n\n\nTo tackle these problems, we propose GAvatar, a novel approach that leverages Gaussian Splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions.\nFirst, we introduce a new primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation that defines 3D Gaussians inside pose-driven primitives. This representation naturally supports animation and enables flexible modeling of fine avatar geometry and appearance by deforming both the Gaussians and the primitives.\nSecond, we propose to use implicit Gaussian attribute fields to predict the Gaussian", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nReconstructing clothed human avatars from image inputs presents a significant challenge in computer vision, yet holds immense importance due to its applications in virtual reality, gaming, and e-commerce.\nTraditional methods often rely on dense, synchronized multi-view inputs, which may not be readily available in more practical scenarios. Recent advances in implicit neural fields\u00a0[29, 49, 53, 52, 55, 32, 67, 68, 57, 34, 38] have enabled\nhigh-quality reconstruction of geometry\u00a0[63, 40, 59, 8] and appearance\u00a0[39, 37, 33, 24, 44, 21, 13, 60, 72] of clothed human bodies from\nsparse multi-view or monocular videos.\nAnimation of such reconstructed clothed human bodies\nis also possible by learning the geometry and appearance representations in a\npredefined canonical pose\u00a0[60, 59, 37, 21, 13, 72].\n\n\nTo achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality, existing methods rely on training\na neural radiance field (NeRF)\u00a0[29] combined with either\nexplicit body articulation\u00a0[13, 37, 59, 8, 21, 40, 12, 60, 72] or conditioning the NeRF on human body related\nencodings\u00a0[63, 33, 50, 39]. They often employ large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to model the neural radiance field, which are computationally demanding, leading to prolonged\ntraining (days) and inference (seconds) time.\nThis computational expense poses a significant challenge for practical applications of these state-of-the-art methods in real-time applications.\n\n\nWith recent advances in efficient learning of implicit neural fields, training\ntime of NeRFs has been reduced to\nminutes\u00a0[48, 22, 31, 3, 54]. There are also works targeting fast inference of\npretrained NeRFs\u00a0[71, 69, 45].\nInspired by these developments, several avatar reconstruction methods have been\ntailored to fast training \u00a0[7, 12] or fast\ninference\u00a0[18, 6, 41].\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, there currently exists no method that simultaneously achieves both fast training and real-time inference for animatable avatar reconstruction from just monocular videos.\n\n\nPoint-based rendering\u00a0[64, 75, 46, 73, 51, 76, 42] has emerged as an efficient alternative to NeRFs for fast inference. With the recently proposed 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS)\u00a0[14], it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality using only a fraction of NeRFs\u2019 inference time and comparatively fast training for static scene reconstruction.\n\n\nLeveraging the capabilities of 3DGS, we demonstrate its application in modeling animatable clothed avatars using monocular videos.\nOur approach effectively integrates rigid human articulation with a non-rigid deformation field within the 3DGS framework. We use a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to decode color. This MLP is designed to be responsive to local non-rigid deformations and dynamic lighting conditions, ensuring a more realistic and responsive rendering of the avatar\u2019s appearance. Furthermore, we apply as-isometric-as-possible regularizations\u00a0[15, 43] to both the Gaussian mean vectors and the covariance matrices, which helps maintain the geometric consistency and realistic deformation of the avatar, particularly in dynamic and varied poses.\n\n\nOur experimental results show that our method is comparable to or better than current state-of-the-art [59, 60] in animatable avatar creation from monocular inputs, achieving training speed 400 times faster and inference speed 250 times quicker.\nCompared to methods that focus on fast training\u00a0[7, 12], our method, despite being slower in training, can model pose-dependent non-rigid deformation and produce significantly better rendering quality, while being 3 times faster in terms of rendering.\nWe provide an overview of the comparison to major prior works in Tab.\u00a01.\nIn summary, our work makes the following contributions:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe introduce 3D Gaussian", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nCreating a customized human avatar from a single video has great potential for many applications including virtual and augmented reality, the Metaverse, gaming, and movie industries.\nThis task is appealing yet challenging, as the monocular observations are highly underdetermined for the modeling of a 3D animatable avatar.\nMeanwhile, the inaccurate body motion estimations and the complex wrinkle deformations also make it extremely difficult to create a realistic avatar from a single video.\n\n\nThe modeling of 3D human avatars from monocular videos involves a fusion process of 2D observations to a 3D consistent human model.\nFor this purpose, existing solutions have leveraged both implicit and explicit representations to create the base model of avatars.\nAmong them, implicit methods\u00a0[16, 49, 6, 57, 15] define a deformable human NeRF to fuse the image observation from current motion space to a canonical space by inverse skinning.\nHowever, the implicit 3D volume is inefficient in representing human surfaces and the inverse skinning also introduces ambiguous correspondences during the fusion process.\nThese issues make it hard for implicit solutions to capture fine-grained details of moving people.\nAs the avatar appearances are concentrated around human surfaces, explicit representations are much more efficient in modeling avatars.\nPrevious attempts\u00a0[12, 63] have employed differentiable mesh rendering to reconstruct the human surface, but these methods struggle to preserve wrinkle details due to a fixed mesh topology.\nOn the other hand, point-based representations\u00a0[37, 50, 18, 56, 65] are more effective to handle flexible topology but require millions of points to capture detailed appearances.\nHow to represent humans remains one of the fundamental problems for avatar modeling.\n\n\nWhen creating an animatable avatar from a video of moving people, the algorithm is required to learn the relationships between body motions and corresponding appearances.\nHowever, the motions estimated from monocular videos are typically faulty, leading to large artifacts in the modeling of dynamic cloth deformations.\nTo address this issue, previous works\u00a0[49, 16, 42, 1, 45, 15, 57] have attempted to optimize body motions along with the learning of animatable avatar volumes.\nAs the body motions are explicitly represented as parametric meshes, the implicit 3D volume of previous methods makes the optimization indirect and less effective.\nThis issue has even become the main obstacle to achieving high-quality avatar modeling from monocular videos.\n\n\n\nTo tackle the above issues, we introduce new representations and solutions to achieve high-quality avatar modeling from a single video.\nThe key insight of our solution is to model dynamic human surfaces explicitly and optimize both the motion and appearances jointly in an end-to-end manner.\nTo this end, we propose GaussianAvatar, a method to reconstruct human avatars with dynamic appearances using the 3D Gaussian representation\u00a0[17].\nAs an explicit representation, 3D Gaussian can be easily reposed from the canonical space to the motion space via a forward skinning process.\nSuch an animatable 3D Gaussian representation bypasses the inverse skinning process used in the aforementioned NeRF-based methods and overcomes the previous one-to-many issue\u00a0[4] during canonicalization.\nBased on the animatable 3D Gaussian, our method can fuse 3D appearances more consistently from 2D observations to a canonical 3D space.\nTo model dynamic human appearances under different poses, we additionally add pose-dependent properties to 3D Gaussians and incorporate them with the canonical", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nCreating high-quality 3D humans from user condition is of great importance to a wide variety of applications, ranging from virtual try-on\u00a0[78, 69, 70, 29] to immersive telepresence\u00a0[39, 67, 98, 42, 27, 28]. To this end, researchers explore the task of text-driven 3D human generation, which synthesizes the character\u2019s appearance and geometry based on text prompts. Traditional methods resort to a hand-crafted pipeline, where 3D models are first regressed from multi-view human captures, and then undergo a series of manual processes like rigging and skinning\u00a0[3, 26, 38, 35]. To ease human labor for 3D asset creation of diverse layouts, the exemplar work DreamFusion\u00a0[59] proposes score distillation sampling (SDS) to harness rich 2D text-to-image prior (e.g., Stable Diffusion\u00a0[65], Imagen\u00a0[66]) by optimizing 3D scenes to render samples that reside on the manifold of higher likelihood. Though accomplishing reasonable results on single objects\u00a0[64, 50, 83, 6], it is hard for them to model detailed human bodies with complex articulations.\n\n\nTo incorporate structural guidance, recent text-driven 3D human studies combine SDS with body shape models such as SMPL\u00a0[46] and imGHUM\u00a0[1]. In particular, a common paradigm is to integrate human priors into representations like mesh and neural radiance field (NeRF), either by taking the body shape as mesh/density initialization\u00a0[20, 93, 36], or by learning a deformation field based on linear blend skinning (LBS)\u00a0[4, 85, 92]. However, they mostly compromise to trade-off between efficiency and quality: the mesh-based methods\u00a0[41, 25, 90] struggle to model fine topologies like accessories and wrinkles; while the NeRF-based methods\u00a0[22, 94, 23] are time/memory-consuming to render high-resolution results. How to achieve fine-grained generation efficiently remains an unsolved problem.\n\n\nRecently, the explicit neural representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\u00a0[33] provides a new perspective for real-time scene reconstruction. It enables multi-scale modeling across multiple granularities, which is suitable for 3D human generation. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to exploit such representation in this task with two challenges:\n1) 3DGS characterizes a tile-based rasterization by sorting and \u03b1\ud835\udefc\\alphaitalic_\u03b1-blending anisotropic splats within each view frustum, which only back-propagates a small set of high-confidence Gaussians. However, as verified in the 3D surface-/volume-rendering studies\u00a0[17, 76, 31, 52], sparse gradient could hinder network optimization of geometry and appearance. Therefore, structural guidance is required in 3DGS, especially for the human domain that demands hierarchical structure modeling and generation controllability.\n2) The naive SDS necessitates a large classifier-free guidance (CFG)\u00a0[18] scale for image-text alignment (e.g., 100100100100 as used in\u00a0[59]). But it sacrifices visual quality with over-saturated patterns, making realistic human generation difficult. Besides, due to the stochasticity of SDS loss, the original gradient-based density control in 3DGS is unstable, which incurs blurry results with floating artifacts.\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our intuition lies in that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. The key is to incorporate explicit structural guidance and gradient regularization to facilitate Gaussian optimization.\nSpecifically, we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that jointly learns human appearance and geometry. Unlike", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nAfter NeRFs\u00a0[22], 3D Gaussian Splatting\u00a0[15] has recently become very popular for capturing a 3D scene and rendering it from novel points of view. 3D Gaussian Splatting optimizes the positions, orientations, appearances (represented as spherical harmonics), and alpha blending of many tiny 3D Gaussians on the basis of a set of training images of the scene to capture the scene geometry and appearance. Because rendering the Gaussians is much faster than rendering a neural field, 3D Gaussian Splatting is much faster than NeRFs and can capture a scene in a few minutes.\n\n\nWhile the Gaussians allow very realistic renderings of the scene, it is still however challenging to extract the surface of the scene from them: As shown in Figure\u00a03, after optimization by 3D Gaussian Splatting, the Gaussians do not take an ordered structure in general and do not correspond well to the actual surface of the scene. In addition to the surface itself, it is also often desirable to represent the scene as a mesh, which remains the representation of choice in many pipelines: A mesh-based representation allows for powerful tools for editing, sculpting, animating, and relighting the scene. Because the Gaussians after Gaussian Splatting are unstructured, it is very challenging to extract a mesh from them. Note that this is also challenging with NeRFs albeit for different reasons.\n\n\nIn this paper, we first propose a regularization term that encourages the Gaussians to be well distributed over the scene surface so that the Gaussians capture much better the scene geometry, as shown in Figure\u00a03. Our approach is to derive a volume density from the Gaussians under the assumption that the Gaussians are flat and well distributed over the scene surface. By minimizing the difference between this density and the actual one computed from the Gaussians during optimization, we encourage the 3D Gaussians to represent well the surface geometry.\n\n\nThanks to this regularization term, it becomes easier to extract a mesh from the Gaussians. In fact, since we introduce a density function to evaluate our regularization term, a natural approach would be to extract level sets of this density function. However, Gaussian Splatting performs densification in order to capture details of the scene with high fidelity, which results in a drastic increase in the number of Gaussians. Real scenes typically end up with one or several millions of 3D Gaussians with different scales and rotations, the majority of them being extremely small in order to reproduce texture and details in the scene.\nThis results in a density function that is close to zero almost everywhere, and the Marching Cubes algorithm\u00a0[21]\nfails to extract proper level sets of such a sparse density function even with a fine voxel grid, as also shown in Figure\u00a03.\n\n\nInstead, we introduce a method that very efficiently samples points on the visible part of a level set of the density function, allowing us to run the Poisson reconstruction algorithm\u00a0[14] on these points to obtain a triangle mesh. This approach is scalable, by contrast with the Marching Cubes algorithm for example, and reconstructs a surface mesh within minutes on a single GPU, compared to", " Introduction\nDigital 3D asserts have become indispensable in our digital\nage, enabling the visualization, comprehension, and interac-\ntion with complex objects and environments that mirror our\nreal-life experiences. Their impact spans a wide range of do-\nmains including architecture, animation, gaming, virtual and\naugmented reality, and is widely used in retail, online confer-\nencing, education, etc. The extensive use of 3D technologies\nbrings a significant challenge, i.e., generating high-quality\n3D content is a process that needs a lot of time, effort, and\nskilled expertise.\nThis stimulates the rapid developments of 3D content gen-\neration approaches [ 5,14,16,21\u201324,29,31,34,35,41,47].\nAmong them, text-to-3D generation [ 5,14,21,29,31,34,47,\n52] stands out for its ability to create imaginative 3D models\nfrom mere text descriptions. This is achieved by utilizing\na pretrained text-to-image diffusion model as a strong im-\nage prior to supervise the training of a neural parameterized\n3D model, enabling for rendering 3D consistent images in\nalignment with the text. This remarkable capability is funda-\nmentally grounded in the use of Score Distillation Sampling\n(SDS). SDS acts as the core mechanism that lifts 2D discussion.\n5\u201cA DSLR photo of the Imperial State Crown of England.\u201d\n\u201cA DSLR photo of a Schnauzer wearing a pirate hat .\u201d\nProlificDreamer(VSD)(~ 8hrs)Ours(~35mins)Fantasia3D(~ 1h)DreamFusion (SDS)(~ 30mins)Magic3D(~ 1h)\nFigure 4.

In the methodology section of our main\npaper, we propose to mitigate such a problem by introducing\nDDIM inversion for noisy latent estimation. Hence, we\nfurther examine the effect of replacing the vanilla add noise\nfunction for x0\u2192xtwith DDIM inversion in Fig. 9 (d)\n9and (e). It can be seen that, the pseudo-GTs that incorporate\nwith DDIM inversion are more similar to the input views in\nFig. 9 (a). Therefore, they are significantly more consistent\nfeature and style-wise between different views and timesteps\ncompared to Fig. 9 (b) and (c). Meanwhile, such a property\nholds when we increase \u03b4Tfrom 20 to 200.

We will delve deeper into this problem in\nSec. 7.3.2.\n3D distillation v.s. image-to-image translation As we\ndiscussed in the main paper, ISM follows the basic intuition\nof SDS which generates pseudo-GTs with 2D diffusion mod-\nels by referencing x0. Intuitively, such a process is quite sim-\nilar to the diffusion-based image-to-image translation tasks\nthat have been discussed in some previous works [ 28,44]\nthat intend to alter the input image towards the given condi-\ntion in a similar manner. In such a perspective, since SDS\nperturbs the clean sample x0with random noises, it encoun-\nters the same problem with SDEdit [ 28] that it struggles to\nfind an ideal timestep twhich ensures both the editability of\nthe algorithm while maintaining the basic structure of the\ninput image.\nInstead, our ISM adopts DDIM inversion to estimate xt\nfromx0and thus share more common senses with DDIB [ 44]\nwhich mitigates the aforementioned problem.

There-\nfore, we decided to employ a forward-only mapping. D3GA\nis built on 3DGS extended by a neural representation and\ntetrahedral cages to model the color and geometry of each\ndynamic part of the avatar, respectively. In the following,we introduce the formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting and\ngive a detailed description of our method D3GA.\n3.1. 3D Gaussian Splatting\n3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [14] is designed for real-\ntime novel view synthesis in multi-view static scenes. Their\nrendering primitives are scaled 3D Gaussians [17, 52] with\na 3D covariance matrix \u03a3and mean \u00b5:\nG(x) =e\u22121\n2(x\u2212\u00b5)T\u03a3\u22121(x\u2212\u00b5).

[66] define the pro-\njection of 3D Gaussians onto the image plane as:\n\u03a3\u2032=AW\u03a3WTAT, (2)\nwhere \u03a3\u2032is a covariance matrix in 2D space, Wis the view\ntransformation, and Ais the Jacobian of the affine approx-\nimation of the projective transformation. During optimiza-\ntion, enforcing the positive semi-definiteness of the covari-\nance matrix \u03a3is challenging. To avoid this, Kerbl et al. [14]\nuse an equivalent formulation of a 3D Gaussian as a 3D el-\nlipsoid parameterized with a scale Sand rotation R:\n\u03a3=RSSTRT. (3)\n3DGS uses spherical harmonics [40] to model the view-\ndependent color of each Gaussian. In practice, appearance\nis modeled with an optimizable 48 elements vector repre-\nsenting four bands of spherical harmonics.\n3.2. Cage Based Deformation Transfer\nTo deform 3D Gaussians, we leverage tetrahedron cage-\nbased deformations as a coarse proxy for the body, face, and\nindividual garments. To create a cage per garment, we seg-\nment all images of a single time instance using an Efficient-\nNet [47] backbone with PointRend [16] refinement, trained\non a corpus of similar multi-view captures. The per-image\n2D segmentation masks are projected onto a body mesh \u02c6M\n3to obtain per-triangle labels (body, upper, lower). To get the\nmesh \u02c6M, we fit a low-resolution LBS model to a single 3D\nscan of the subject and then fit such model to the segmented\nframe by minimizing the distance to the 3D keypoints, ex-\ntracted with an EfficientNet trained on similar captures. We\ntransform the body mesh into canonical space with LBS and\ndivide it into body part templates Mk. The garment meshes\nare additionally inflated 3cm along the vertex normals. Af-\nter that, we use TetGen [42] to turn the unposed meshes Mk\ninto tetrahedral meshes Tk. Consequently, cages for gar-\nments are hollow, containing only their outer layer, while\nthe body cage is solid. The face cage is composed of the\nbody", " INTRODUCTION\n3D content creation is important for many applications, such as interactive gaming, cinematic arts,\nAR/VR, and simulation. However, it is still challenging and expensive to create a high-quality 3D\nasset as it requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, automating this process with generative\nmodels has become an important problem, which remains challenging due to the scarcity of data\nand the complexity of 3D representations.\nRecently, techniques based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) (Poole et al., 2022; Lin et al.,\n2023; Chen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b), also known as Score Jacobian Chaining (SJC) (Wang\net al., 2023a), have emerged as a major research direction for text-to-3D generation, as they can\nproduce high-quality and intricate 3D experiments, we find that CSD combined\nwith general negative prompts can achieve high-quality texture quality comparable to VSD.\n5 E XPERIMENTS\nWe evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Classifier Score Distillation method across three tasks:\ntext-guided 3D generation, text-guided texture synthesis, and text-guided 3D editing.

Subsequently, the\nscene is converted into a triangular mesh via differentiable surface extraction (Shen et al., 2021) and\nfurther refined using high-resolution mesh renderings by differentiable rasterization (Laine et al.,\n2020). For the NeRF generation, we utilize the DeepFloyd-IF stage-I model (StabilityAI, 2023),\nand for the mesh refinement, we use the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model (Rombach et al., 2022) to\nenable high-resolution supervision. For both stages, CSD is used instead of SDS.\nText-Guided Texture Synthesis Given a mesh geometry and a text prompt, we apply CSD to ob-\ntain a texture field represented by Instant-NGP (M \u00a8uller et al., 2022). We employ ControlNets (Zhang\n& Agrawala, 2023) based on the Stable Diffusion 1.5 as our diffusion guidance since it can improve\nalignment between the generated textures and the underlying geometric structures.

In practice, at every optimization iteration, different values of tand Gaussian noise \u03f5are\nrandomly drawn. The parameters \u03b8are then optimized by computing the gradient of LSDSwith\nrespect to xand backpropagating this gradient through the differentiable parametric function g.\nPoole et al. (2022) formally show that LSDSminimizes the KL divergence between a family of\nGaussian distributions around xand the distributions p(zt, y, t)learned by the pretrained diffusion\nmodel. Intuitively, Equation 2 can be interpreted as follows: since x=g(\u03b8)is a clean rendered\nimage, Gaussian noise is first added to it in order to approximately project it to the manifold of\nnoisy images corresponding to timestep t. Next, the score \u03f5s\n\u03d5(zt(x);y, t)provides the direction in\nwhich this noised version of xshould be moved towards a denser region in the distribution of real\nimages (noised to timestep tand aligned with the condition y). Finally, before the resulting direction\ncan be used to optimize \u03b8, the initially added noise \u03f5is subtracted. We interpret this last step as an\nattempt to adapt the direction back to the domain of clean rendered images.\nWhile SDS provides an elegant mechanism for leveraging pretrained text-to-image models, SDS-\ngenerated Appendix A.4, we provide comparison using threestudio (Guo et al., 2023) for all method appendix.\n4(a)xID (b)xOOD (c)\u03b4N (d)\u03b4D (e)xOOD+\u03b4D\nFigure 3: Visualization of \u03b4Nand\u03b4D. Columns (a) and (b) show a pair of in-domain ( xID) and\nout-of-domain ( xOOD) images, both depicting the same underlying content. We add the same noise\nto both images, and use the pre-trained diffusion model to predict the score. Intuitively, the noised\nxIDimage requires no domain correction, and thus the predicted score consists of only \u03b4N, shown in\n(c). Subtracting \u03b4Nfrom the prediction for the noised xOODimage gives us the domain correction\n\u03b4D, shown in (d). Indeed, adding \u03b4DtoxOODproduces a more realistic image, as shown in (e).zt\n \u03f5\u03d5(zt;\u2205, t)\u2212\u03f5\nt= 1 t= 100 t= 200 t= 300 t= 500 t= 700 t= 1000\nFigure 4: Visualization of \u03b4N\u2212\u03f5.

Bottom row: the\nresidual \u03f5\u03d5(zt;\u2205, t)\u2212\u03f5between the network prediction and the actual noise. Since the original\nimage is in-domain (generated by SD), \u03b4D\u22480, and therefore, \u03f5\u03d5(zt;\u2205, t)\u2248\u03b4N. For visualization\npurposes, the residual is decoded and clamped between -1 and 1. Although we do not expect the\nresidual \u03b4N\u2212\u03f5to be correlated with the image, it may be seen that some correlation in fact exists,\nand furthermore, the residual becomes progressively noisier at smaller timesteps t.\nTo summarize so far, using the components discussed above, we can rewrite the CFG score as:\n\u03f5s\n\u03d5(zt;y, t) =\u03b4D+\u03b4N+s\u03b4C.

However, the pursuit of high-quality 3D content generation\u00a0[31, 5, 40, 42] following the success of 2D generation poses a novel and meaningful challenge. Within the broader scope of 3D content creation, 3D human generation\u00a0[12, 19, 20] holds particular significance. It plays a pivotal role in applications such as AR/VR, holographic communication, and the metaverse.\n\n\n\nTo achieve 3D content generation, a straightforward approach is to train generative models like GANs or diffusion models to generate 3D representations\u00a0[4, 2, 47, 14]. However, these approaches face challenges due to the scarcity of current 3D datasets, resulting in restricted diversity and suboptimal generalization.\nTo overcome these challenges, recent methods\u00a0[31, 21, 24] adopt a 2D-guided approach to achieve 3D generation. Their core framework builds upon pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and distills 3D contents from 2D generated images through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss\u00a0[31]. Leveraging the image generation priors learned from large-scale datasets, this framework enables more diverse 3D generation. However, current text-to-image diffusion models primarily emphasize the generation of natural RGB images, which results in a limited perception of 3D geometry structure and view direction. This limitation can result in Janus (multi-faced) artifacts and smooth geometry. Moreover, the texture of the 3D contents generated by existing methods is sometimes not based on geometry, which can result in fake 3D details, particularly in wrinkles and hair. Although some 3D human generation methods\u00a0[3, 19, 20] introduce human body models such as SMPL\u00a0[22] for animation and enhancing the quality of body details, they fail to address these fundamental limitations. Their results still suffer from sub-optimal geometry, fake 3D details and over-saturated texture.\n\n\nFigure 2: 2D results by normal-adapted and depth-adapted diffusion models. The view-dependent texts like \u201cfront view\u201d are utilized to control the view direction. The body-aware texts like \u201cupper body\u201d are employed to control which body part is generated. \n\n\nIn this paper, we present HumanNorm, a novel approach for generating high-quality and realistic 3D human models. The core idea is introducing a normal diffusion model to enhance the perception of 2D diffusion model for 3D geometry. HumanNorm is divided into two components: geometry generation and texture generation. For the geometry generation, we train a normal-adapted diffusion model using multi-view normal maps rendered from 3D human scans and prompts with view-dependent and body-aware text. Compared with text-to-image diffusion models, the normal-adapted diffusion model filters out the influence of texture and can generate high-fidelity surface normal maps according to prompts. This ensures the generation of 3D geometric details and avoids Janus artifacts. Since normal maps lack depth information, we also learn a depth-adapted diffusion model to further enhance the perception of 3D geometry. The 2D results generated by these diffusion models are presented in Fig.\u00a02. The geometry is generated using both normal and depth SDS losses, which are based on our normal-adapted and depth-adapted diffusion models. Furthermore, a progressive strategy is designed to reduce geometric noise and enhance geometry quality.\n\n\nAs previously discussed, the core challenges for texture generation are fake", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nAutomatic 3D digital content creation finds applications across various domains, including digital games, advertising, films, and the MetaVerse.\nThe core techniques, including image-to-3D and text-to-3D, offer substantial advantages by significantly reducing the need for manual labor among professional artists and empowering non-professional users to engage in 3D asset creation.\nDrawing inspiration from recent breakthroughs in 2D content generation\u00a0(Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022), the field of 3D content creation has experienced rapid advancements. Recent studies in 3D creation can be classified into two principal categories: inference-only 3D native methods and optimization-based 2D lifting methods.\nTheoretically, 3D native methods\u00a0(Jun & Nichol, 2023; Nichol et\u00a0al., 2022; Gupta et\u00a0al., 2023) exhibit the potential to generate 3D-consistent assets within seconds, albeit at the cost of requiring extensive training on large-scale 3D datasets. The creation of such datasets demand substantial human effort, and even with these efforts, they continue to grapple with issues related to limited diversity and realism\u00a0(Deitke et\u00a0al., 2023b; a; Wu et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nOn the other hand, Dreamfusion\u00a0(Poole et\u00a0al., 2022) proposes Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to address the 3D data limitation by distilling 3D geometry and appearance from powerful 2D diffusion models\u00a0(Saharia et\u00a0al., 2022), which inspires the development of recent 2D lifting methods\u00a0(Lin et\u00a0al., 2023; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023b; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023c).\nIn order to cope with the inconsistency and ambiguity caused by the SDS supervision,\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF)\u00a0(Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020) are usually adopted for their capability in modeling rich 3D information.\nAlthough the generation quality has been increasingly improved, these approaches are notorious for hours-long optimization time due to the costly NeRF rendering, which restricts them from being deployed to real-world applications at scale.\nWe argue that the occupancy pruning technique used to accelerate NeRF\u00a0(M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2022; Sara Fridovich-Keil and Alex Yu et\u00a0al., 2022) is ineffective in generative settings when supervised by the ambiguous SDS loss as opposed to reconstruction settings.\n\n\nIn this work, we introduce the DreamGaussian framework, which greatly improves the 3D content generation efficiency by refining the design choices in an optimization-based pipeline.\nPhoto-realistic 3D assets with explicit mesh and texture maps can be generated from a single-view image within only 2 minutes using our method.\nOur core design is to adapt 3D Gaussian Splatting\u00a0(Kerbl et\u00a0al., 2023) into the generative setting with companioned meshes extraction and texture refinement.\nCompared to previous methods with the NeRF representation, which find difficulties in effectively pruning empty space,\nour generative Gaussian splatting significantly simplifies the optimization landscape.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate the progressive densification of Gaussian splatting, which is in accordance with the optimization progress of generative settings, greatly improves the generation efficiency.\nAs illustrated in Figure\u00a01, our image-to-3D pipeline swiftly produces a coarse shape within seconds and converges efficiently in around 500500500500 steps on a single GPU.\n\n\nDue to the ambiguity in SDS supervision and spatial densification, the directly generated results from 3D Gaussians tend to be blurry.\nTo address the issue, we identify that the texture needs to be refined explicitly, which requires delicate textured polygonal mesh extraction from the generated 3D Gaussians.\nWhile this task has not been explored before, we design an efficient algorithm for mesh extraction from 3D Gaussians by local density querying.\nThen a generative UV-space refinement stage is proposed", " Introduction\nHigh-quality reconstruction and photorealistic rendering of\ndynamic scenes from a set of input images is critical for a\nvariety of applications, including augmented reality/virtual\nreality (AR/VR), 3D content production, and entertain-\nment.

Recently, NeRF [28] facilitates photorealistic novel\nview synthesis through the use of MLPs. Subsequent re-\nsearch has expanded the utility of NeRF to various applica-\ntions, encompassing tasks such as mesh reconstruction from\na collection of images [20, 45], inverse rendering [5, 25, 54],\noptimization of camera parameters [21, 47, 48], and few-\nshot learning [10, 51].\nConstructing radiance fields for dynamic scenes is a crit-\nical branch in the advancement of NeRF, with significant\nimplications for real-world applications. A cardinal chal-\nlenge in rendering these dynamic scenes lies in the encod-\ning and effective utilization of temporal information, espe-\ncially when addressing the reconstruction of monocular dy-\nnamic scenes, a task inherently involves sparse reconstruc-\ntion from a single viewpoint. One class of dynamic NeRF\napproaches models scene deformation by adding time tas\nan additional input to the radiance field. However, this strat-\negy couples the positional variations induced by temporal\nchanges with the radiance field, lacking the geometric prior\ninformation regarding the influence of time on the scene.\nConsequently, substantial regularization is required to en-\nsure temporal consistency in the rendering results. experiments, we\nuniformly used a black Experiments on FPS with respect to the number of 3D Gaussians.

Traditional pipelines used in the\nentertainment industry often use sophisticated multi-view\ncapture studios [3, 22, 32] to create complex 3D models.\nManual processes like cleaning and rigging the scans\nmake creating an animatable character time-consuming\nand expensive. While there is recent progress on\nautomatic learning-based body reconstruction from single\nimage [20, 28, 29, 48, 49, 67, 68, 70], or sparse\nimages [54], such Related Work\nRecently, there has been rapid progress on extending\ntext-to-2D-image generation results. Experiments\nWe first demonstrate our expressive, holistic, animation of\nthe avatars, then evaluate their quality, and the consistency\nbetween texture and geometry. Finally, ablation studies are\nconducted to analyze the effectiveness of each component.\n5.1. Expressive Holistic Body Animation\nOne crucial feature that distinguishes our method from\nothers is that TADA enables natural full-body animations\nover the face, body and hands. Figure 4 illustrates the\nanimation of characters generated by TADA using only with\ntext as input. In the first case, we convert text to audio [61]\nand then use TalkSHOW [72] create expressive SMPL-X\nanimations of the upper body, face and hands. In the second\ncase we use priorMDM [53] to convert text into SMPL [31]\nanimations, which we convert to SMPL-X [39]. Thanks\nsemantic correspondence with SMPL-X, the characters are\neasily animated with natural movements of the fully body\nand face. This consistency with SMPL-X means that avatars\ngenerated by TADA can be animated using any of the recent\ntext to animation Discussion\nWhile TADA shows promising Conclusion\nWe introduce TADA, a simple yet effective method\nfor generating high-quality and animatable 3D textured\navatars solely from text input. These avatars cover\na wide range of individuals, including celebrities and\ncustomized characters. They seamlessly integrate into\nexisting CG pipelines, catering to various industries\nlike fashion and entertainment. The key contributions\ninclude: 1) utilizing a subdivided version of SMPL-X with\nlearned displacement layer and UV texture, 2) employing\nhierarchical optimization with adaptive focal lengths, 3)\nenforcing geometry-texture alignment through geometric\nconsistency loss, and 4) training with animation to keep\nsemantic correspondence with SMPL-X. We validate these\ncomponents through ablation studies and demonstrate\nthe superiority of TADA over other SOTAs with both\nqualitative and quantitative Acknowledgments .

Traditional manual construc-\ntion of these intricate 3D models is a labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming process, requiring thousands of hours from\nskilled artists possessing extensive aesthetic and 3D mod-\neling expertise. Consequently, automating the generation of\nhigh-quality 3D avatars using only natural language descrip-\ntions holds great research prospects with the potential to\nsave resources, which is also the goal of our work.\nIn recent years, significant efforts have been made in\nreconstructing high-fidelity 3D avatars from multi-view\nvideos (Isik et al. 2023; Jiang et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023b;\nWang et al. 2023a; Zheng et al. 2023) or reference images\n(Wang et al. 2021; Xiu et al. 2022).

The initial result lacks detail (e.g., no sword in\nthe back, no armguards) and exhibits numerous floating ar-\ntifacts. The overall quality is blurry and unclear. Upon in-\ncorporating the progressive grid, more voxels are gathered\naround the avatar region, this introduces more details into\nthe avatar. By progressively narrowing the camera distance,\nthe model can leverage the detail inherent in the latent diffu-\nsion, thereby eliminating a large number of floating artifacts\nand enhancing local details, such as the sword in the back.\nThe focus mode further zooms in and utilizes a resolution\nof 512 \u00d7512 to target and optimize certain body parts, gen-\nerating high-definition and intricate local details.

In contrast, recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) meth-\nods build on continuous scene representations, typically optimizing\na Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using volumetric ray-marching for\nnovel-view synthesis of captured scenes. Similarly, the most efficient\nradiance field solutions to date build on continuous representations\nby interpolating values stored in, e.g., voxel [Fridovich-Keil and Yu\net al.2022] or hash [M\u00fcller et al .2022] grids or points [Xu et al .2022].\nWhile the continuous nature of these results\nin a moderate increase in Gaussians to process which however is\namortized by simpler control flow and high parallelism of optimized\nGPU Radix sort [Merrill and Grimshaw 2010]. We assign a key for\neach splats instance with up to 64 bits where the lower 32 bits\nencode its projected depth and the higher bits encode the index of\nthe overlapped tile. The exact size of the index depends on how\nmany tiles fit the current resolution. Depth ordering is thus directly\nresolved for all splats in parallel with a single radix sort. After\nACM Trans.

This lack of transparency hampers reproducibility, stifles innovation, and prevents the community from building upon these models to further the progress of science and art. Moreover,\nthese closed-source strategies make it challenging to assess the biases and limitations of these models in an impartial and objective way, which is crucial for their responsible and ethical deployment. With SDXL we are releasing an open model that achieves competitive performance with black-box image generation models (see \u00a0Fig.\u00a010\u00a0&\u00a0Fig.\u00a011).\n\n\n \n\n2 Improving Stable Diffusion\n\n\nIn this section we present our improvements for the Stable Diffusion architecture. These are modular, and can be used individually or together to extend any model. Although the following strategies are implemented as extensions to latent diffusion models (LDMs)\u00a0[38], most of them are also applicable to their pixel-space counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1:  Left: Comparing user preferences between SDXL and Stable Diffusion 1.5 & 2.1.

However, with the development of foundational", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nHuman motion generation aims to automatically synthesize natural human movements. It has wide applications in robotics, animation, games, and generative creation. Given a text description or audio command, motion generation can be controllable to obtain the desired human motion sequence. Text-conditioned motion generation has garnered increasing attention in recent years since it behaves in a more natural interactive way\u00a0[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\n\n\nAlthough existing text-motion datasets\u00a0[4, 11, 6, 8] have greatly facilitated the development of motion generation\u00a0[2, 12, 13, 14, 9], their scale, diversity, and expressive capability remain unsatisfactory.\nImagine generating \u201ca man is playing the piano happily\", as depicted in Fig.\u00a01(a), the motion from existing dataset\u00a0[4] only includes the body movements, without finger movements or facial expressions.\nThe missing hand gestures and facial expressions severely hinder the high level of expressiveness and realism of the motion. Additionally, certain specialized motions, such as high-level skiing, aerial work, and riding are challenging to be captured in indoor scenes.\nTo sum up, existing datasets suffer from four main limitations: 1) body-only motions without facial expressions and hand poses; 2) insufficient diversity and quantity, only covering indoor scenes; 3) lacking diverse and long-term motion sequences; and 4) manual text labels that are unscalable, unprofessional and labor-intensive. These limitations hinder existing generation methods to synthesize expressive whole-body motion with diverse action types. Therefore, how to collect large-scale whole-body motion and text annotations from multi-scenarios are critical in addressing the data scarcity issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Different from (a) previous motion dataset\u00a0[4, 8],\n(b) our dataset captures body, facial expressions, and hand gestures.\nWe highlight the comparisons of facial expressions and hand gestures.\n\n\n\nCompared to indoor marker-based mocap systems, markerless vision-based motion capture methods\u00a0[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] become promising to capture large-scale motions from massive videos. Meanwhile, human motion can be regarded as a sequence of kinematic structures, which can be automatically translated into pose scripts using rule-based techniques\u00a0[3]. More importantly, although markerless capture (e.g., pseudo labels) is not as precise as marker-based methods, collecting massive and informative motions, especially local motions, could still be beneficial\u00a0[21, 15, 22, 23, 24]. Besides, text-driven motion generation task requires semantically corresponding motion labels instead of vertex-corresponding mesh labels, and thus have a higher tolerance of motion capture error.\nBearing these considerations in mind, we design a scalable and systematic pipeline for motion and text annotation in both multi-view and single-view videos.\nFirstly, we gather and filter massive video recordings from a variety of scenes with challenging, high-quality, multi-style motions and sequence-level semantic labels.\nSubsequently, we estimate and optimize the parameters of the SMPL-X model\u00a0[25] for the whole-body motion annotation. Due to the depth ambiguity and various challenges in different scenes, existing monocular estimation models typically fail to yield satisfactory results. To address this issue, we systematically design a high-performance framework incorporating several innovative techniques, including a hierarchical approach for whole-body keypoint estimation, a score-guided adaptive temporal smoothing and optimization scheme, and a learning-based 3D human model fitting process. By integrating these techniques, we can accurately and efficiently capture the ultimate 3D motions.\nFinally, we design an automatic algorithm to caption frame-level descriptions of", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nHumans are situated in a 3D environment. To simulate this experience for entertainment or research, we require a significant number of 3D assets to populate virtual environments like games and robotics simulations. Generating such 3D content is both expensive and time-consuming, necessitating skilled artists with extensive aesthetic and 3D modeling knowledge. It\u2019s reasonable to inquire whether we can enhance this procedure to make it less arduous and allow beginners to create 3D content that reflects their own experiences and aesthetic preferences.\n\n\nRecent advancements in text-to-image generation\u00a0(Ramesh et\u00a0al., 2022; Saharia et\u00a0al., 2022; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022) have democratized image creation, enabled by large-scale image-text datasets, e.g., Laion5B\u00a0(Schuhmann et\u00a0al., 2022), scraped from the internet. However, 3D data is not as easily accessible, making 3D generation with 2D supervision very attractive.\nPrevious works\u00a0(Poole et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2022; Lin et\u00a0al., 2022; Metzer et\u00a0al., 2022; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023) have utilized pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models as a strong image prior to supervise 2D renderings of 3D models, with promising showcases for text-to-3D generation. However, the generated 3D models are often in low quality with unrealistic appearance, mainly due to the fact that text-to-image models are not able to produce identity-consistent object across multiple generations, neither can it provide camera pose-sensitive supervision required for optimizing a high-quality 3D representation.\nTo mitigate such supervision conflicts, later works orthogonal to ours have explored using generative models with novel view synthesis capability\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2023a; b) or adapting pre-trained model to be aware of camera pose and current generation\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2023).\nHowever, challenges remain for creative 3D content creation, as the generation process still suffers from some combination of the following limitations as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01: (1) requiring a long optimization time to generate a 3D object (slow convergence); (2) low generation quality such as missing text-implied attributes and distorted shape and texture; (3) low generation diversity.\n\n\nAs a class of score-based generative models\u00a0(Ho et\u00a0al., 2020; Song & Ermon, 2019; Song et\u00a0al., 2021b), diffusion models contain a data noising and a data denoising process according to a predefined schedule over fixed number of timesteps. They model the denoising score \u2207\ud835\udc31log\u2061pdata\u2062(\ud835\udc31)subscript\u2207\ud835\udc31subscript\ud835\udc5ddata\ud835\udc31\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\log p_{\\text{data}}(\\mathbf{x})\u2207 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT data end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x ), which is the gradient of the log-density function with respect to the data on a large number of noise-perturbed data distributions. Each timestep (t\ud835\udc61titalic_t) corresponds to a fixed noise with the score containing coarse-to-fine information as t\ud835\udc61titalic_t decreases. For image synthesis, the sampling process respects the discipline of coarse-to-fine content creation by iteratively refining samples with monotonically decreasing t\ud835\udc61titalic_t. However, the recent works leveraging pre-trained data scores for diffusion-guided 3D generation\u00a0(Poole et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2022; Lin et\u00a0al., 2022; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023; Qian et\u00a0al., 2023) randomly sample t\ud835\udc61titalic_t during the process of 3D model optimization, which is counter-intuitive.\n\n\nIn this paper, we first investigate what a 3D model learns from pre-trained diffusion models at each noise level. Our key intuition is that pre-trained diffusion models provide different levels of visual concepts for different noise levels. At 3D model initialization, it needs coarse high-level information for structure formation. Later optimization steps should instead focus on refining", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe remarkable progress in Large Language Models Raffel et\u00a0al. (2020); Brown et\u00a0al. (2020) has sparked considerable interest in generating a wide variety of media modalities from text. There has been significant progress in text-to-image Ramesh et\u00a0al. (2021, 2022); Rombach et\u00a0al. (2022); Yu et\u00a0al. (2022); Chang et\u00a0al. (2023); Nichol et\u00a0al. (2021), text-to-speech Oord et\u00a0al. (2018); Ping et\u00a0al.

Key to the success of some of the popular generative image methods conditioned on text has been diffusion models Rombach et\u00a0al. (2022); Ramesh et\u00a0al. (2022); Saharia et\u00a0al. (2022b). Recent works have shown these text-to-image models can be combined with differentiable neural 3D scene representations Barron et\u00a0al. (2022) and optimized to generate realistic 3D models solely from textual descriptions Jain et\u00a0al. (2022); Poole et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\nControllable generation of photorealistic 3D human models has been in the focus of the research community for a long time. This is also the goal of our work; we want to generate realistic, animatable 3D humans given only textual descriptions. Our method goes beyond static text-to-3D generation methods, because we learn a dynamic, articulated 3D model that can be placed in different poses, without additional training or fine-tuning. We capitalize on the recent progress in text-to-3D generation Poole et\u00a0al. (2023), neural radiance fields Mildenhall et\u00a0al. (2020); Barron et\u00a0al. (2022) and human body modelling Xu et\u00a0al. (2020); Alldieck et\u00a0al. (2021) to produce 3D human models with realistic appearance and high-quality geometry. We achieve this without using any supervised text-to-3D data, or any image conditioning. We photorealistic and animatable 3d human models by relying only on text, as can be seen in Figure\u00a01 and Figure\u00a02. As impressive as general-purpose 3D generation methods Poole et\u00a0al. (2023) are, we argue these are suboptimal for 3D human synthesis, due to limited control over generation which often results in undesirable visual artifacts such as unrealistic body proportions, missing limbs, or the wrong number of fingers. Such inconsistencies can be partially attributed to known problems of text-to-image networks, but become even more apparent when considering the arguably more difficult problem of 3D generation. Besides enabling animation capabilities, we show that geometric and kinematic human priors can resolve anthropometric consistency problems in an effective way.\nOur proposed method, coined DreamHuman, can become a powerful tool for professional artists and 3D animators and can automate complex parts of the design process, with potentially transformative effects in industries such as gaming, special effects, as well as film and content creation.\n\n\nOur main contributions are:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present a novel method to generate 3D human models that can be placed in a variety a poses, with realistic\nclothing deformations, given only a single textual description, and by training without any supervised text-to-3D data.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur models incorporate 3D human body priors that are necessary for regularizing the generation and re-posing of the resulting avatar, by using multiple losses to ensure the quality of human structure, appearance, and deformation.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe improve the quality of the generation by means of semantic zooming with refining prompts to add detail in perceptually important", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Examples of multiple views of 3D objects generated by from our model given text prompts (below each object).\n\n\n\nThe task of automatic text-to-3D generation aims to create 3D assets based on a text description and has gained significant attention due to its wide-ranging applications in digital content generation, film-making, and Virtual Reality (VR)\u00a0(Lin et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023b).\nInitial efforts in this domain centered on unconditional 3D asset generation, experimenting with various 3D representation modalities presented in explicit formats such as meshes\u00a0(Achlioptas et\u00a0al., 2018; Luo & Hu, 2021; Smith & Meger, 2017; Xie et\u00a0al., 2018), as well as implicit formats such as fields\u00a0(Chen & Zhang, 2019; Mittal et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhuang et\u00a0al., 2023).\nFollowing this, the field has progressed towards conditional 3D generative models, e.g., with text-based guidance\u00a0(Cheng et\u00a0al., 2023). However, these studies have been limited to relatively simple 3D assets, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated 3D datasets.\n\n\nThe availability of ample image datasets and the success of text-to-image generation have paved the way for lifting pre-trained text-to-image models to the 3D domain. Specifically, recent studies focus on optimizing a 3D representation for an asset, using pre-trained text-to-image generative models by providing a denoising score for rendered images\u00a0(Khalid et\u00a0al., 2022; Jain et\u00a0al., 2022; Poole et\u00a0al., 2022; Xu et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023a; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023b).\nPoole et\u00a0al. (2022) proposed a loss from the distillation of a text-to-image diffusion model. They minimized\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a family of Gaussian distributions based on the forward diffusion process and the denoising scores acquired from the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The proposed Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method combined with a NeRF enables 3D asset generation from given text prompts.\nSubsequent research has improved generation quality through various approaches including the adoption of two-stage optimization frameworks\u00a0(Lin et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023b; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023c), alterations to the original SDS formulation\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2023a; b), and the disentanglement of geometry and appearance\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2023b).\n\n\nIn this work, we revisit the integration of the SDS approach with NeRFs, aiming to achieve photo-realistic and high-quality text-to-3D generation through a single-stage optimization.\nIn contrast to existing text-to-3D generation work, we distill the score in the text-to-image diffusion model\u2019s latent and image spaces for enhanced supervision. Moreover, we observe that the efficacy of the diffusion prior is limited in previous works\u00a0(Poole et\u00a0al., 2022; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023) when timesteps (also referred to as noise levels in denoising score matching) are randomly sampled during optimization. Specifically, we observe that toward the end of the training process, the NeRF becomes almost determined in representing a particular 3D asset. Thus, we find that randomly sampling a large timestep drives the diffusion model to produce a denoised image that is distinct and unrelated to the original input rendering. This yields inconsistent distillation from the diffusion model and compromised optimization of NeRFs. To address this, we introduce a timestep annealing approach where the timestep in the forward diffusion process inversely correlates with the square root of the number of training iterations. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed", " Introduction\n3D content and technologies enable us to visualize, comprehend, and interact with complex objects\nand environments that are reflective of our real-life experiences. Their pivotal role extends across a\nwide array of domains, encompassing architecture, animation, gaming, and the rapidly evolving fields\nof virtual and augmented reality. In spite of the extensive applications, the production of premium 3D\ncontent often remains a formidable task. It necessitates a significant investment of time and effort,\neven when undertaken by professional designers. This challenge has prompted the development of\ntext-to-3D methods, and\nwe use the same setting of CFG (e.g. 7.5) as the common text-to-image generation task for the best\nperformance. To the best of our knowledge, this for the first time addresses the problem in previous\nSDS [ 34,20,4,29] that it usually requires a large CFG (i.e., 100). Specifically, SDS (Eq. (3)) uses\n(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5)while VSD (Eq. (9))) uses (\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y )). For example,\nfor the 2D special case of g(\u03b8, c)\u2261\u03b8, we have \u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)]and\n\u2207\u03b8LVSD(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y ))]. Intuitively, to obtain highly detailed\nsamples, the updating direction for \u03b8needs to be \u201cfine\u201d and \u201csharp\u201d. As SDS only depends on \u03f5pretrain ,\nit needs a large CFG ( = 100 ) to make sure \u03f5pretrain to be \u201csharp\u201d enough; however, large CFG, in turn,\nreduces the diversity of the results of ProlificDreamer compared with baselines.\n36 Background\nWe present preliminaries on diffusion models, score distillation sampling, and 3D representations.\nDiffusion models.

As shown in Table 6, the FID by VSD is much better than SDS. As\nthe 2D setting isolates the sampling algorithm from the 3D representations, we can directly compare\ndifferent sampling algorithms, finding that VSD can get better sample quality than SDS (though still\nworse than SOTA diffusion samplers, it can generalize to 3D cases).\nL Why using SDS in stage-2 for the geometry optimization of mesh?\nVSD can also be used to generate geometry. To validate this, we provide an ablation example in\nFig. 21 (3a),(3b). As shown in the figure, VSD can obtain reasonable geometry.

It has numerous applications (e.g., anima-\ntion/game production [29] and virtual try-on [56]), attract-\ning signi\ufb01cant attention from academia and industry.\nWhile earlier controllable HIG solutions based on gener-\native adversarial networks (GANs) [10,23\u201326,33,44,51,54]\nand variational auto-encoders (V AEs) [7, 14, 34, 46] have\nbeen successfully applied in certain applications (e.g., vir-\ntual try-on), they have not gained mainstream acceptance\ndue to their training dif\ufb01culties and poor multi-modality fu-\nsion and alignment capabilities [52]. Recently, diffusion\nmodels [12, 35, 40] have demonstrated unprecedented text-\nto-image generation performance [32] and quickly become\nthe dominant technique in this exciting \ufb01eld. However, it is\ndif\ufb01cult to provide precise position control with text infor-\nmation, especially for deformable objects such as humans.\nTo tackle the above problem, two concurrent controllable\ndiffusion models were proposed in the literature: Control-\nNet [53] and T2I-Adapter [27]. Both models introduce an\nadditional learnable diffusion branch on top of the frozen\npre-trained stable diffusion (SD) model [35]. The addi-\ntional branch enables the enforcement of various conditions\nsuch as skeleton and sketch during image generation, which\ngreatly improves the original SD model in terms of control-\nlability, thereby gaining huge traction from the community.\nHowever, the learnable branch in such dual-branch dif-\nfusion models is essentially performing a challenging im-\nage feature editing task and suffers from several limita-\ntions. Consider the skeleton-guided controllable HIG prob-\nlem that generates humans with speci\ufb01c poses. Given text\nprompts containing human activities, the SD branch may\ngenerate various images that are inconsistent with the skele-\nton guidance, e.g., humans could present at different places\nwith various poses. Therefore, the extra condition branch\nneeds to learn not only how to generate humans according\nto the given skeleton guidance but also how to suppress var-\nious inconsistencies, making training more challenging and\ninference less stable. Generally speaking, the larger the gap\nbetween skeleton guidance and original images produced by\nthe frozen SD branch, the higher discrepancy between the\ngiven guidance and generated human images. Moreover,\nthe inference cost of these dual-branch solutions largely in-\ncreases compared to the original SD model.\nIn contrast to employing an additional trainable branch\nfor controllable HIG, this work proposes a native skeleton-\nguided diffusion model, named HumanSD . By directly \ufb01ne-\ntuning the SD model [35] with skeleton conditions concate-\nnated to the noisy latent embeddings, as shown in Figure\n2 (a), HumanSD can natively guide image generation with\nthe desired pose, instead of conducting a challenging imageediting task. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting effects\ncaused by model over\ufb01tting during \ufb01ne-tuning, we propose\na novel heatmap-guided denoising loss for diffusion mod-\nels to disentangle between conditioned humans and uncon-\nditioned backgrounds in the training stage. Such a disen-\ntanglement forces the \ufb01ne-tuning process to concentrate on\nthe generation of foreground humans while minimizing un-\nexpected overrides of the pre-trained SD model parameters\nthat hurt the model\u2019s generation and generalization abilities.\nBesides the algorithm, training data is another important\nfactor determining model performance [38]. To improve\nthe HIG quality of HumanSD , we \ufb01ne-tune our model on\nthree large-scale human-centric datasets containing high-\nquality images and the corresponding 2D skeletal infor-\nmation and text descriptions: GHI,LAION-Human , and\nHuman-Art .

DreamAvatar can generate high-quality geometry and texture for any type of human avatar.\n\n\n\nThe creation of 3D graphical human models has received great attention in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications in fields such as film-making, video games, AR/VR, and human-robotic interaction. Traditional methods for building such complex 3D models require thousands of man-hours of trained artists and engineers\u00a0[10, 12], making the process both time-consuming and highly expert-dependent. With the development of deep learning methods, we have witnessed the emergence of promising methods\u00a0[54, 5, 61] which can reconstruct 3D human models from monocular images. These techniques, however, still face challenges in fully recovering details from the input images and rely heavily on the training dataset. To tackle these challenges and simplify the modeling process, adopting generative models for 3D human avatar modeling has recently received increasing attention from the research community. This approach has the potential to alleviate the need for large 3D datasets and facilitate easier and more accessible 3D human avatar modeling.\n\n\nTo leverage the potential of 2D generative image models for 3D content generation, recent methods\u00a0[46, 29, 35, 8, 31] have utilized pretrained text-guided image diffusion models to optimize 3D implicit representations (e.g., NeRFs\u00a0[37] and DMTet\u00a0[40, 56]). DreamFusion\u00a0[46] introduces a novel Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) strategy to self-supervise the optimization process and achieves promising results.\nHowever, human bodies, which are the primary focus of this paper, exhibit a complex articulated structure, with head, arms, hands, trunk, legs, feet, etc., each capable of posing in various ways. As a result,\nwhile DreamFusion\u00a0[46] and subsequent methods (e.g., Magic3D\u00a0[29], ProlificDreamer\u00a0[58], Fantasia3D\u00a0[8]) produce impressive results, they lack the proper constraints to enforce consistent 3D human structure and often struggle to generate detailed textures for 3D human avatars. Latent-NeRF\u00a0[35] introduces a sketch-shape loss based on the 3D shape guidance, but it still faces challenges in generating reasonable results for human bodies.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present DreamAvatar, a novel framework for generating high-quality 3D human avatars from text prompts and shape priors.\nInspired by previous works\u00a0[46, 29], DreamAvatar employs a trainable NeRF as the base representation for predicting density and color features for each 3D point. Coupled with pretrained text-to-image diffusion models\u00a0[50, 68], DreamAvatar can be trained to generate 3D avatars using 2D self-supervision.\nThe key innovation of DreamAvatar lies in three main aspects. Firstly, we leverage the SMPL model\u00a0[32] to provide a shape prior, which yields robust shape and pose guidance for the generation process. Secondly, we introduce a dual-observation-space (DOS) design\nconsisting of a canonical space and a posed space\nthat are related by a learnable deformation field and are jointly optimized. This facilitates the generation of more complete textures and geometry faithful to the target pose.\nThirdly,\nwe propose to jointly optimize the losses computed from the full body and from the zoomed-in 3D head to alleviate the multi-face \u201cJanus\u201d problem and improve facial details in the generated avatars.\n\n\nWe extensively evaluate DreamAvatar on generating movie/anime/video game characters, as well as general people, and compare it with previous methods. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods and can generate high-quality 3D human", " Introduction\nCreating human avatars is crucial for content generation\nin various immersive media, where users can alter the char-\nacter to a specific identity, apply an artistic style, or ani-\n*Corresponding Author.mate with simple motion control. While traditional manual\nauthoring of digital characters often involves cumbersome\nand time-consuming efforts from skilled artists, the recent\nprogress in human digitization has shown exciting potential\ntowards more user-friendly solutions. Nevertheless, avatar\ngeneration still faces a set of tough challenges. First of all,\nintuitive control is highly coveted for the system to under-\nstand specific user needs in the most natural form. Second,\nthe generated avatars should be immediately ready for ap-\nplications such as view synthesis, scene composition, and\nretargetable animation. Finally, the avatars should be of\nhigh quality, considering both the overall visual fidelity and\npreservation of target styles or identities in geometry and\ntexture, especially when being manipulated or animated.\nSignificant efforts have been made in search of natu-\nral user controls for avatars. One representative stream of\nworks [7, 2, 11, 47, 52, 51, 50] takes reference images\nto stylize an avatar. Unfortunately, finding suitable refer-\nences that perfectly match the desired shape and appear-\nance is not always easy, substantially limiting real-world\nuse. On the other hand, text prompts are attracting more\nattention as a more natural control for generating high-\nquality 3D avatars, with the recent advances in large-scale\nvision-language models. In particular, text-to-3D avatar\ncreation [16, 56, 31, 53] is explored by leveraging the zero-\nshot generation ability of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-\nTraining (CLIP) [41]. Following this trend, our work also\ntackles the problem of text-guided avatar creation. In par-\nticular, we aim at high-quality 3D avatar generation, which\nnot only supports static view synthesis but also allows for\ncontrollable animation.\nText-driven avatar creation poses great challenges in pro-\n1arXiv:2303.17606v2  [cs.CV]  21 Aug 2023ducing high-quality geometry and texture while providing\nflexible animation capabilities.

Limitations\nWhile Fantasia3D demonstrates promising advance-\nments in the realm of generating photorealistic 3D assets\nfrom text prompts, several limitations remain. For instance,\nwhile our method successfully produces loose visual ef-\nfects, it remains a significant challenge to generate cor-\nresponding loose geometries, such as hair, fur, and grass,\nsolely based on text prompts. Additionally, our method pri-\nmarily emphasizes object generation, thereby lacking the\ncapacity to generate complete scenes with background from\ntext prompts. Consequently, our future research endeavors\nwill be dedicated to addressing these limitations by focus-\ning on the generation of complete scenes and intricate loose\ngeometries.\n7. Experiments\nIn this section, we present comprehensive Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present Fantasia3D, a new method for\nautomatic text-to-3D generation. Fantasia3D uses disentan-\ngled modeling and learning of geometry and appearance,\nand is able to generate both the fine surface and rich mate-\nrial/texture. Fantasia3D is based on the hybrid scene repre-\nsentation of DMT ET. For geometry learning, we propose to\nencode a rendered normal map, and use shape encoding of\nthe normal as the input of the pre-trained, stable diffusion\nmodel. For appearance modeling, we introduce the spatially\nvarying BRDF into the text-to-3D task, thus enabling ma-\nterial learning that supports photorealistic rendering of the\nlearned surface. Expect for text prompts, our method can\nbe triggered with a customized 3D shape as well; this is\nflexible for users to better control what content is to be gen-\nerated. Our method is also convenient to support relighting,\nediting, and physical simulation of the generated 3D assets.\nOur method is based on pre-trained image diffusion mod-\nels (i.e., the stable diffusion). In future research, we are\ninterested in learning 3D diffusion directly", " Introduction\n\u201cThe in\ufb01nite use of \ufb01nite means. \u201d\n\u2013 Noam Chomsky (Chomsky, 1965)\nGenerative image models conditioned on text can now\nproduce photorealistic and diverse images (Ramesh et al.,\n1Alibaba Group2Ant Group.

To further achieve\ncustomized generation, many recent works extend the text-\nto-image models by introducing conditions such as segmen-\ntation maps (Rombach et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b;\nCouairon et al., 2022), scene graphs (Yang et al., 2022),\nsketches (V oynov et al., 2022), depthmaps (stability.ai,\n2022), and inpainting masks (Xie et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\n2022a), or by \ufb01netuning the pretrained models on a few\nsubject-speci\ufb01c data (Gal et al., 2022; Mokady et al., 2022;\nRuiz et al., 2022). Nevertheless, these models still provide\nonly a limited degree of controllability for designers when\nit comes to using them for practical applications. For\nexample, generative models often struggle to accurately\nproduce images with speci\ufb01cations for semantics, shape,\nstyle, and color all at once, which is common in real-world\ndesign projects.\nWe argue that the key to controllable image generation\nrelies not only on conditioning, but even more signi\ufb01cantly\noncompositionality (Lake et al., 2017). The latter can\nexponentially expand the control space by introducing an\nenormous number of potential combinations ( e.g.,a hundred\nimages with eight representations each yield about 1008\ncombinations). Similar concepts are explored in the \ufb01elds\nof language and scene understanding (Keysers et al., 2019;\nJohnson et al., 2016), where the compositionality is termed\ncompositional generalization , the skill of recognizing or\ngenerating a potentially in\ufb01nite number of novel combina-\ntions from a limited number of known components.\nIn this work, we build upon the above idea and present\nComposer, a realization of compositional generative models .\nBycompositional generative models , we refer to generative\nmodels that are capable of seamlessly recombining visual\ncomponents to produce new images (Figure 1). Speci\ufb01cally,\nwe implement Composer as a multi-conditional diffusion\nmodel with a UNet backbone (Nichol et al., 2021). At every\ntraining iteration of Composer, there are two phases: in the\ndecomposition phase, we break down images in a batch into\nindividual representations using computer vision algorithms\nor pretrained models; whereas in the composition phase, we\noptimize Composer so that it can reconstruct these images\nfrom their representation subsets.

Our system,\nwhich we call PersonNeRF enables us to render the subject\nunder novel unobserved combinations of camera viewpoint,\nbody pose, and appearance.\nFree-viewpoint rendering from unstructured photos is a\nparticularly challenging task because a photo collection can\ncontain images at different times where the subject has dif-\nferent clothing and appearance. Furthermore, we only have\naccess to a handful of images for each appearance, so it is\nunlikely that all regions of the body would be well-observed\nfor any given appearance. In addition, any given body pose\nis likely observed from just a single or very few camera\nviewpoints.\nWe address this challenging scenario of sparse viewpoint\nand pose observations with changing appearance by mod-\neling a single canonical-pose neural volumetric represen-\ntation that uses a shared motion weight \ufb01eld to describe\nhow the canonical volume deforms with changes in body\npose, all conditioned on appearance-dependent latent vec-\ntors. Our key insight is that although the observed body\nposes have different appearances across the photo collec-\ntion, they should all be explained by a common motion\nmodel since they all come from the same person. Further-\nmore, although the appearances of a subject can vary across\nthe photo collection, they all share common properties such\nas symmetry so embedding appearance in a shared latent\nspace can help the model learn useful priors.\nTo this end, we build our work on top of Human-\nNeRF [46], which is a state-of-the-art free-viewpoint hu-\nman rendering approach that requires hundreds of images\nof a subject without clothing or appearance changes. Along\nwith regularization, we extend HumanNeRF to account for\nsparse observations as well as enable modeling diverse ap-\npearances. Finally, we build an entire personalized space\nspanned by camera view, body pose, and appearance that\nallows intuitive exploration of arbitrary novel combinations\nof these attributes (as shown in Fig. 1).\n2. Related Work\n3D reconstruction from unstructured photos Recon-\nstructing static scenes from unstructured photo collections\nis a longstanding research problem in the \ufb01elds of com-\nputer vision and graphics. The seminal Photo Tourism sys-\ntem [39] applies large-scale structure-from-motion [36] to\ntourist photos of famous sites, enabling interactive naviga-\ntion of the 3D scene. Subsequent works leveraged multi-\nview stereo [10, 37] to increase the 3D reconstruction qual-\nity [1, 38]. Recently, this problem has been revisited withneural rendering [19, 30, 40, 43, 44]. In particular, Neu-\nral Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [32] have enabled photoreal-\nistic view synthesis results in\nFID in Table 3 and visually compare them with Human-\nNeRF [46] in Fig. 9.

Our work is most closely related to\nHumanNeRF [46], which reconstructs a volumetric neural\n\ufb01eld from a monocular video of a moving human.

With the advent of\ntext-to-image diffusion\nmodels\u2009[54, 62, 72], we\ncan now create visually stunning images by typing in a text\nprompt.\nYet, text-to-image models are limited in the control\nthey provide over the spatial composition of the image;\nprecisely expressing complex layouts, poses, shapes and forms\ncan be difficult via text prompts alone.\nGenerating an image\nthat accurately matches our mental imagery often requires numerous\ntrial-and-error cycles of editing a prompt, inspecting the\nresulting images and then re-editing the prompt.\n\nCan we enable finer grained spatial control by letting users\nprovide additional images that directly specify their desired\nimage composition?\nIn computer\nvision and machine learning, these additional images (e.g.,\nedge maps, human pose skeletons, segmentation maps, depth,\nnormals, etc.) are often treated as conditioning on the image\ngeneration process. Image-to-image translation\nmodels\u2009[34, 98] learn the mapping\nfrom conditioning images to target images. The research\ncommunity has also taken steps to control text-to-image models\nwith spatial masks\u2009[6, 20],\nimage editing instructions\u2009[10],\npersonalization via\nfinetuning\u2009[21, 75], etc. While\na few problems (e.g., generating image variations,\ninpainting) can be resolved with training-free techniques like\nconstraining the denoising diffusion process or editing\nattention layer activations, a wider variety of problems like\ndepth-to-image, pose-to-image, etc., require end-to-end\nlearning and data-driven solutions.\n\nLearning conditional controls for large text-to-image\ndiffusion models in an end-to-end way is challenging. The\namount of training data for a specific condition may be\nsignificantly smaller than the data available for general\ntext-to-image training. For instance, the largest datasets\nfor various specific problems (e.g., object shape/normal, human\npose extraction, etc.) are usually about 100K in size, which\nis 50,000 times smaller than the\nLAION-5B\u2009[79] dataset that was used to\ntrain Stable Diffusion\u2009[82]. The direct finetuning or\ncontinued training of a large pretrained model with limited\ndata may cause overfitting and catastrophic\nforgetting\u2009[31, 75].\nResearchers have shown that such forgetting can be alleviated by restricting the number or rank of trainable parameters\u2009[14, 25, 31, 92].\nFor our problem, designing deeper or more customized neural architectures might be necessary for handling in-the-wild conditioning images with complex shapes and diverse high-level semantics.\n\nThis paper presents ControlNet, an end-to-end neural\nnetwork architecture that learns conditional controls for\nlarge pretrained text-to-image diffusion models (Stable\nDiffusion in our implementation). ControlNet preserves the\nquality and capabilities of the large model by locking its\nparameters, and also making a trainable copy of its\nencoding layers. This architecture treats the large pretrained\nmodel as a strong backbone for learning diverse conditional\ncontrols. The trainable copy and the original, locked model\nare connected with zero convolution layers, with weights\ninitialized to zeros so that they progressively grow during\nthe training. This architecture ensures that harmful noise is\nnot added to the deep features of the large diffusion model at\nthe beginning of training, and protects the large-scale\npretrained backbone in the trainable copy from being damaged\nby such noise.\n\n\nOur experiments show that ControlNet can control Stable\nDiffusion with various conditioning inputs, including Canny\nedges, Hough lines, user scribbles, human key points,\nsegmentation maps, shape normals, depths,\netc. (Figure\u20091). We test our approach using a\nsingle conditioning image, with or without text prompts, and\nwe demonstrate how our approach supports the composition of\nmultiple conditions. Additionally, we report that the\ntraining of ControlNet is robust and scalable on datasets of\ndifferent sizes, and that for some tasks like depth-to-image\nconditioning, training ControlNets on a single NVIDIA RTX\n3090Ti GPU can", " Introduction\nMachine learning is experiencing a renaissance powered\nby transformers. Over the past \ufb01ve years, neural architec-\ntures for natural language processing [8, 42], vision [10]\nand several other domains have largely been subsumed by\ntransformers [60]. Many classes of image-level genera-\ntive models remain holdouts to the trend, though\u2014while\ntransformers see widespread use in autoregressive mod-\nels [3,6,43,47], they have seen less adoption in other gener-\native modeling frameworks. For example, diffusion models\nhave been at the forefront of recent advances in image-level\ngenerative models [9,46]; yet, they all adopt a convolutional\nU-Net architecture as the de-facto choice of backbone.\n*Work done during an internship at Meta AI, FAIR Team.\nCode and project page available here.\n1arXiv:2212.09748v2  [cs.CV]  2 Mar 2023520 80 320GflopsDiameterFigure 2.

Performance steadily improves in FID as model \ufb02ops increase.\nRight: Our best model, DiT-XL/2, is compute-ef\ufb01cient and outperforms all prior U-Net-based diffusion models, like ADM and LDM.\nThe seminal work of Ho et al. [19] \ufb01rst introduced the\nU-Net backbone for diffusion models. Having initially seen\nsuccess within pixel-level autoregressive models and con-\nditional GANs [23], the U-Net was inherited from Pixel-\nCNN++ [52, 58] with a few changes. The model is con-\nvolutional, comprised primarily of ResNet [15] blocks. In\ncontrast to the standard U-Net [49], additional spatial self-\nattention blocks, which are essential components in trans-\nformers, are interspersed at lower resolutions. Dhariwal and\nNichol [9] ablated several architecture choices for the U-\nNet, such as the use of adaptive normalization layers [40] to\ninject conditional information and channel counts for con-\nvolutional layers. However, the high-level design of the U-\nNet from Ho et al. has largely remained intact.\nWith this work, we aim to demystify the signi\ufb01cance of\narchitectural choices in diffusion models and offer empiri-\ncal baselines for future generative modeling research. We\nshow that the U-Net inductive bias is notcrucial to the per-\nformance of diffusion models, and they can be readily re-\nplaced with standard designs such as transformers. As a\nresult, diffusion models are well-poised to bene\ufb01t from the\nrecent trend of architecture uni\ufb01cation\u2014e.g., by inheriting\nbest practices and training recipes from other domains, as\nwell as retaining favorable properties like scalability, ro-\nbustness and ef\ufb01ciency. A standardized architecture would\nalso open up new possibilities for cross-domain research.\nIn this paper, we focus on a new class of diffusion models\nbased on transformers. We call them Diffusion Transform-\ners, or DiTs for short. DiTs adhere to the best practices of\nVision Transformers (ViTs) [10], which have been shown to\nscale more effectively for visual recognition than traditional\nconvolutional networks (e.g., ResNet [15]).More speci\ufb01cally, we study the scaling behavior of trans-\nformers with respect to network complexity vs. sample\nquality . We show that by constructing and benchmark-\ning the DiT design space under the Latent Diffusion Mod-\nels(LDMs) [48] framework, where diffusion models are\ntrained within a V AE\u2019s latent space, we can successfully\nreplace the U-Net backbone with a transformer. We further\nshow that DiTs are scalable architectures for diffusion mod-\nels: there is a strong correlation between the network com-\nplexity (measured by G\ufb02ops) vs. sample quality (measured\nby FID). By simply scaling-up DiT and training an LDM\nwith a high-capacity backbone (118.6 G\ufb02ops), we are", " Introduction\nMassive datasets have enabled and driven rapid progress\nin AI.

The startling\nadvances brought about by developing large-scale datasets\nfor images, videos, and natural language, demand that an\nequivalent dataset be built for 3D assets.\nWe present O BJAVERSE 1.0, a large scale corpus of high-\nquality, richly annotated, 3D objects; see Fig. 1. Objects\nin our dataset are free to use1and sourced from Sketch-\nfab, a leading online platform for managing, viewing, and\ndistributing 3D models. In total, O BJAVERSE contains\nover 800K 3D assets designed by over 100K artists which\nmakes this data large and diversely sourced. Assets not\nonly belong to varied categories like animals, humans, and\nvehicles, but also include interiors and exteriors of large\nspaces that can be used, e.g., to train embodied agents.\nOBJAVERSE is a universe of rich 3D data with detailed\nmetadata that can support many different annotations to en-\nable new applications.

Typically, the body motion in these methods is represented as the motion of a\n3D mesh of the face/upper-body [30, 51, 18, 50, 5], or 2D/3D landmarks of the face with 2D/3D joints of the hands and body [24, 26, 62]. However, this is not sufficient to understand human behavior. Humans communicate with their bodies, hands and facial expressions together. Capturing such coordinated activities as well as the full 3D surface in tune with speech is critical for virtual agents to behave realistically and interact with listeners meaningfully.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we focus on generating the expressive 3D motion of person, including their body, hand gestures, and facial expressions, from speech alone; see Generating Holistic 3D Human Motion from Speech.\nTo do this, we must learn a cross-modal mapping between audio and 3D holistic body motion, which is very challenging in practice for several reasons. First, datasets of 3D holistic body meshes and synchronous speech recordings are scarce.\nAcquiring them in the lab is expensive and doing so in the wild has not been possible.\nSecond, real humans often vary in shape, and their faces and hands are highly deformable. It is not trivial to generate both realistic and stable results of 3D holistic body meshes efficiently.\nLastly, as different body parts correlate differently with speech signals, it is difficult to model the cross-modal mapping and generate realistic and diverse holistic body motions.\n\n\nWe address the above challenges and learn to model the conversational dynamics in a data-driven way. Firstly, to overcome the issue of data scarcity, we present a new set of 3D holistic body mesh annotations with synchronous audio from in-the-wild videos. This dataset was previously used for learning 2D/3D gesture modeling with 2D body keypoint annotations [24] and 3D keypoint annotations of the holistic body [26] by applying existing models separately. Apart from facilitating speech and motion modeling, our dataset can also support broad research topics like realistic digital human rendering. Then, to support our data-driven approach to modeling speech-to-motion translation, an accurate holistic body mesh is needed.\nExisting methods have focused on capturing either the body shape and pose isolated from the hands and face [9, 29, 64, 38, 20, 65, 54, 68], or the different parts together, which often produces unrealistic or unstable results, especially when applied to video sequences [46, 21, 69]. To solve this, we present SHOW, which stands for ``Synchronous Holistic Optimization in the Wild''. Specifically, SHOW adapts SMPLify-X [46] to the videos of talking persons, and further improves it in terms of stability, accuracy, and efficiency through careful design choices. Figure", " Introduction\nWe introduce a method that converts a pretrained 2D\ndiffusion generative model on images into a 3D generative\nmodel of radiance \ufb01elds, without requiring access to any\n3D data. The key insight is to interpret diffusion models as\n* Equal contribution.learned predictors of a gradient \ufb01eld, often referred to as the\nscore function of the data log-likelihood. We apply the chain\nrule on the estimated score, hence the name Score Jacobian\nChaining (SJC).\nFollowing Hyv\u00e4rinen and Dayan [15], the score is de\ufb01ned\nas the gradient of the log-density function with respect to the\ndata. Diffusion models of various families [ 12,49,51,53]\ncan all be interpreted [ 18,21,53] as modelingrxlogp\u001b(x)\ni.e. the denoising score at noise level \u001b. For readability, we\nrefer to the denoising score as the score. Generating a sam-\nple from a diffusion model involves repeated evaluations\nof the score function from large to small \u001blevel, so that a\nsamplexgradually moves closer to the data manifold. It\ncan be loosely interpreted as gradient descent, with precise\ncontrol on the step sizes so that data distribution evolves to\nmatch the annealed \u001blevel (ancestral sampler [ 12], SDE and\nprobability-\ufb02ow ODE [ 53], etc.). While there are other per-\nspectives to a diffusion model [ 12,49], here we are primarily\nmotivated from the viewpoint that diffusion models produce\na gradient \ufb01eld.\nA natural question to ask is whether the chain rule can be\napplied to the learned gradients. Consider a diffusion model\non images. An image xmay be parameterized by some\n1arXiv:2212.00774v1  [cs.CV]  1 Dec 2022functionfwith parameters \u0012,i.e.,x=f(\u0012). Applying the\nchain rule through the Jacobian@x\n@\u0012converts a gradient on\nimagexinto a gradient on the parameter \u0012. There are many\npotential use cases for pairing a pretrained diffusion model\nwith different choices of f. In this work we are interested\nin exploring the connection between 3D and multiview 2D\nby choosing fto be a differentiable renderer, thus creating a\n3D generative model using only pretrained 2D resources.\nMany prior works [ 2,58,60] perform 3D generative mod-\neling by training on 3D datasets [ 5,23,55,59]. This ap-\nproach is often as challenging as it is format-ambiguous. In\naddition to the high data acquisition cost of 3D assets [ 9],\nthere is no universal data format: point clouds, meshes, volu-\nmetric radiance \ufb01eld, etc, all have computational trade-offs.\nWhat is common to these 3D assets is that they can be ren-\ndered into 2D images. An inverse rendering system, or a\ndifferentiable renderer [ 24,26,29,34,39], provides access\nto the Jacobian J\u0019,@x\u0019\n@\u0012of a rendered image x\u0019at camera\nviewpoint\u0019with respect to the underlying 3D parameteriza-\ntion\u0012. Our method uses differentiable rendering to aggregate\n2D image gradients over multiple viewpoints into a 3D asset\ngradient, and lifts a generative model from 2D to 3D. We\nparameterize a 3D asset \u0012as a radiance \ufb01eld stored on voxels\nand choosefto be the volume rendering function.\nA key technical challenge is that computing the 2D score\nby directly evaluating a diffusion model on a rendered image\nx\u0019leads to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. Gener-\nally, diffusion models are trained as denoisers and have only\nseen noisy inputs during training. On the other hand, our\nmethod requires evaluating the denoiser on non-noisy ren-\ndered images from a 3D asset during optimization, and it\nleads to the OOD problem. To address the issue, we propose\nPerturb-and-Average Scoring , an approach to estimate the\nscore for non-noisy images.\nEmpirically, we \ufb01rst validate the effectiveness", " Introduction\n3D digital content has been in high demand for a variety\nof applications, including gaming, entertainment, architec-\nture, and robotics simulation. It is slowly finding its way into\nvirtually every possible domain: retail, online conferencing,\nvirtual social presence, education, etc. However, creating\nprofessional 3D content is not for anyone \u2014 it requires\nimmense artistic and aesthetic training with 3D modeling ex-\npertise. Developing these skill sets takes a significant amount\nof time and effort. Augmenting 3D content creation with\nnatural language could considerably help democratize 3D\ncontent creation for novices and turbocharge expert artists.\n*\u2020: equal contribution.Image content creation from text prompts [2, 30, 35, 38]\nhas seen significant progress with the advances of diffusion\nmodels [13, 43, 44] for generative modeling of images. The\nkey enablers are large-scale datasets comprising billions\nof samples (images with text) scrapped from the Internet\nand massive amounts of compute. In contrast, 3D content\ngeneration has progressed at a much slower pace. Existing\n3D object generation models [4,9,49] are mostly categorical.\nA trained model can only be used to synthesize objects for a\nsingle class, with early signs of scaling to multiple classes\nshown recently by Zeng et al. [49]. Therefore, what a user\ncan do with these models is extremely limited and not yet\nready for artistic creation. This limitation is largely due to the\nlack of diverse large-scale 3D datasets \u2014 compared to image\nand video content, 3D content is much less accessible on the\nInternet. This naturally raises the question of whether 3D\ngeneration capability can be achieved by leveraging powerful\ntext-to-image generative models.\nRecently, DreamFusion [33] demonstrated its remarkable\nability for text-conditioned 3D content generation by uti-\nlizing a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model [38] that\ngenerates images as a strong image prior. The diffusion\nmodel acts as a critic to optimize the underlying 3D repre-\nsentation. The optimization process ensures that rendered\nimages from a 3D model, represented by Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) [25], match the distribution of photorealis-\ntic images across different viewpoints, given the input text\nprompt. Since the supervision signal in DreamFusion oper-\nates on very low-resolution images ( 64\u00d764), DreamFusion\ncannot synthesize high-frequency 3D geometric and texture\ndetails. Due to the use of inefficient MLP architectures for\nthe NeRF representation, practical high-resolution synthesis\nmay not even be possible as the required memory footprint\nand the computation budget grows quickly with the resolu-\ntion. Even at a resolution of 64\u00d764, optimization times are\nin hours (1.5 hours per prompt on average using TPUv4).\nIn this paper, we present a method that can synthesize\nhighly detailed 3D models from text prompts within a re-\nduced computation time.

These breakthroughs have\nalso resulted in fast progression for text-guided shape gen-\neration [9,29,53]. Most recently, it has been shown [35] that\none can directly use score distillation from a 2D diffusion\nmodel to guide the generation of a 3D object represented as\na Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [30].\nWhile Text-to-3D can generate impressive results in a fast and \ufb02exible object gener-\nation framework. We then introduced shape-guided con-\ntrol on the generated model. We showed two versions of\nshape-guided generation, Sketch-Shape and Latent-Paint,\nand demonstrated their effectiveness for providing addi-\ntional control over the generation process.\nTypically, the notion of rendering refers to generating an\nimage in pixel space. Here, we have presented a method that\nrenders directly into the latent space of a neural model. We\nbelieve that our Latent-NeRF approach opens the avenue for\nmore latent space rendering Related Work\n3D Shape Generation 3D shape synthesis is a long-\nstanding problem in computer graphics and computer vi-\nsion. In recent years, with the emergence of neural net-\nworks, the research in 3D modeling has immensely ad-\nvanced. The most conventional supervision type is applied\ndirectly with 3D shapes, through different representations\nsuch as implicit functions [10, 20, 33], meshes [19, 50] or\npoint clouds [27, 49]. As 3D supervision is often dif\ufb01cult\nto obtain, other works use images to guide the generative\ntask [6, 7, 32]. In fact, even when 3D data is available, 2D\nrenderings are sometimes chosen as the supervising primi-\ntive [5, 8, 18]. For example, in GET3D [18], two generators\nare trained, one generates a 3D SDF, and the other a texture\n\ufb01eld. The output textured mesh is then obtained in a dif-\nferentiable manner by utilizing DMTet [42]. These gener-\nators are adversarially trained with a dataset of 2D images.\nIn [47] a diffusion model has been used to generate multiple\nviews of a given input image. Yet, it has been trained in a\nsupervised manner on a multi-view dataset, unlike our work\nwhich does not require a dataset.Text-to-3D with 2D Supervision Recently, the success\nof text-guided synthesis in numerous domains [1, 2, 17, 34,\n44], has motivated a surge of works that use Language-\nImage models to guide 3D scenes representations. CLIP-\nForge [41] consists of two separate components, an im-\nplicit autoencoder conditioned on shape codes, and a nor-\nmalizing \ufb02ow model that is trained to generate shape codes\naccording to CLIP embeddings. CLIP-Forge exploits the\nfact that CLIP has a joint text-image embedding space to\ntrain on image embeddings and infer on text embeddings,\nachieving text-to-shape capabilities.

Still, in some cases, it could be ben-\ne\ufb01cial to further re\ufb01ne the model by \ufb01ne-tuning it in pixel\nspace, and have the NeRF model operate directly in RGB.\nTo do so, we must convert the NeRF that was trained in la-\ntent space to a NeRF that operates in RGB. This requires\nconverting the MLP\u2019s output from the", " Introduction\nLearning from multimodal data such as text, images, and audio is a longstanding research challenge\nin machine learning [ 31,51,56,83,86]. Recently, contrastive loss functions combined with large\nneural networks have led to breakthroughs in the generalization capabilities of vision and language\nmodels [ 58,59,66]. For instance, OpenAI\u2019s CLIP models [ 58] achieved large gains in zero-shot\nclassi\ufb01cation on ImageNet [ 65], improving from the prior top-1 accuracy of 11.5% [ 41] to 76.2%.\n1Project page: https://laion.ai/laion-5b-a-new-era-of-open-large-scale-multi-modal-datasets/\n1arXiv:2210.08402v1  [cs.CV]  16 Oct 2022In addition, CLIP achieved unprecedented performance gains on multiple challenging distribution\nshifts [3,23,61,70,78,82]. Inspired by CLIP\u2019s performance, numerous groups have further improved\nimage-text models by increasing the amount of computation and the training set size [ 28,54,89,94].\nAnother recent success of multimodal learning is in image generation, where DALL-E [ 59] and later\nmodels [52,60,64,66,90] demonstrated the potential of text-guided image generation by producing\nhigh-quality images speci\ufb01c to the provided text.\nA critical ingredient in this new generation of image-text models is the pre-training dataset. All of\nthe aforementioned advances rely on large datasets containing hundreds of millions or even billions\nof image-text pairs, e.g., 400 million for CLIP [ 58] and 6.6 billion for BASIC [ 54]. However, none\nof these datasets are publicly available . While OpenAI still released the CLIP models publicly [ 58],\nlater papers made neither the pre-training dataset nor the resulting models available to the wider\nresearch community [ 2,28,52,54,66,89,90]. As a result, research in this area has pooled into a\nsmall number of industrial research labs, limiting transparency and impeding research progress.\nIn this work, we address this challenge and make multimodal training more accessible by assembling\na public dataset that is suitable for training large image-text models. Speci\ufb01cally, we introduce\nLAION-5B, the largest public image-text dataset containing over 5.8 billion examples (see Table 1 for\na comparison). By starting from Common Crawl [1] and \ufb01ltering this data source with an existing\nCLIP model, we derive a dataset consisting of three parts: 2.32 billion English image-text examples,\n2.26 billion multilingual examples, and 1.27 billion examples that are not speci\ufb01c to a particular\nlanguage (e.g., places, products, etc.). Beyond assembling the dataset, we also explore its ethical\nimplications and \ufb02aws that emerge with large-scale data collection.

An epitome of this revolution is the\nvolumetric recording and playback of 4D (space-time) human perfor-\nmances that subsequently allows a user to watch the performance\nimmersively in virtual environments. Specifically, a user can interact\nwith the performer as if they were physically present, as simple as\nmoving about to change perspectives and as sophisticated as edit-\ning the contents at her fingertips. By far, the most widely adopted\nworkflow to produce volumetric human performance is still to re-\nconstruct and track a dynamic mesh with a per-frame texture map.\nSignificant advances, classic and learning-based, have been made on\nreconstruction algorithms in both academia [Collet et al .2015; Dou\net al.2017; Sch\u00f6nberger and Frahm 2016] and industry [Metastage\n2019; PhotoScan 2019], perhaps symbolized by the acquisition of\nCapturing Reality by Epic Games. In reality, either photogrammetric\nor 3D scanning-based reconstructions are still time-consuming and\nremain vulnerable to occlusions and lack of textures which causes\nholes and noise. Fixing the final reconstructed sequence to meet\nthe minimal immersive viewing requirement demands excessive\ncleanup works by experienced artists.\nRecent neural advances [Lombardi et al .2019; Tewari et al .2020;\nWu et al .2020] attempt to bypass explicit reconstructions and instead\nfocus on synthesizing photo-realistic novel views. Most notably, the\nNeural Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al .2020] replaces the\ntraditional notion of geometry and appearance with a single MLP\nnetwork where rendering individual pixels in any new camera view\nmaps to per-ray network inference. The original NeRF and its accel-\neration schemes [M\u00fcller et al .2022; Yu et al .2021a] mainly focus\non static scenes whereas more recent approaches [Peng et al .2021b;Tretschk et al .2020; Zhang et al .2021; Zhao et al .2022] aim to extend\nsuch neural representations to dynamic scenes with time as a latent\nvariable. Brute-force training and rendering strategies are inefficient\nand real-time rendering, in particular, requires striking an intricate\nbalance between space [M\u00fcller et al .2022; Sara Fridovich-Keil and\nAlex Yu et al .2022; Yu et al .2021a] and quality [Suo et al .2021;\nWang et al .2022]. In the context of animatable human avatars, it\nis also possible to produce neural characters by imposing paramet-\nric human models as priors [Bagautdinov et al .2021; Habermann\net al.2021; Liu et al .2021; Xiang et al .2021]. Yet, their final quality\nrelies heavily on pre-scanned or parametric templates and tedious\ntime-consuming per-actor training.\nAnother major challenge with neural approaches is that their results. Given the \ud835\udc5f, we sort the\nvertices by Y-axis and pick the ED node when it is outside \ud835\udc5ffrom the\nset of existing ED nodes.

These models have transformed\nthe research community and captured widespread public attention with creative image generation\n[22,54] and editing applications [ 21,41,34]. To pursue this research direction further, we introduce\nImagen, a text-to-image diffusion model that combines the power of transformer language models\n(LMs) [ 15,52] with high-\ufb01delity diffusion models [ 28,29,16,41] to deliver an unprecedented\ndegree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding in text-to-image synthesis. In\ncontrast to prior work that uses only image-text data for model training [e.g., 53,41], the key \ufb01nding\nbehind Imagen is that text embeddings from large LMs [ 52,15], pretrained on text-only corpora, are\nremarkably effective for text-to-image synthesis.

Within this framework, CLIP [ 39] has\nemerged as a successful representation learner for images. CLIP embeddings have a number of\ndesirable properties: they are robust to image distribution shift, have impressive zero-shot capabilities,\nand have been \ufb01ne-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art results). We also plot the aesthetic quality against Recall5, since guidance typically induces a trade-off\n5Recall is computed with respect to the training dataset.\n13Real Image\n DALL-E\n GLIDE\n Make-A-Scene\n unCLIP\n unCLIP (prod.)\n\u201ca green train is coming\ndown the tracks\u201d\u201ca group of skiers are\npreparing to ski down\na mountain.\u201d\u201ca small kitchen with\na low ceiling\u201d\u201ca group of elephants\nwalking in muddy\nwater.\u201d\u201ca living area with a\ntelevision and a table\u201d\nFigure 12: Random image samples on MS-COCO prompts.\n141.01.52.02.53.03.54.0\nguidance scale4.604.654.704.754.804.85mean AVA predictionGLIDE\nunCLIP (AR)\nunCLIP (diffusion)\n4.60 4.65 4.70 4.75 4.80 4.85\nmean AVA prediction0.4500.4750.5000.5250.5500.5750.600recall\nGLIDE\nunCLIP (AR)\nunCLIP (diffusion)Figure 13: Aesthetic quality evaluations comparing GLIDE and unCLIP using 512 auto-generated artistic\nprompts.

Our goal with\nthis evaluation is to assess how well each model produces artistic illustrations and photographs. To this end,\nwe generated 512 \u201cartistic\u201d captions using GPT-3 [ 4] by prompting it with captions for existing artwork (both\nreal and AI generated). Next, we trained a CLIP linear probe to predict human aesthetic judgments using\nthe A V A dataset [ 33] ( Appendix A). For each model and set of sampling hyperparameters, we produce four\nimages for each prompt, and report the mean predicted aesthetic judgment over the full batch of 2048 images.\nIn Figure 13, we present experiments in this paper were trained with the hyperparameters described\nbelow, unless otherwise noted. We additionally trained a production version of unCLIP using similarly\nsized models but with modi\ufb01ed architectures and trained for longer; we include changes to accommodate\nproduct and safety requirements (e.g. inpainting, preventing unwanted memorization), and train on a larger\ndataset that is \ufb01ltered for aesthetic quality and safety. We report model and training hyperparameters for the\npaper models in Table 3. All models were trained using Adam [ 27] with corrected weight decay [ 29] and\nmomentum\f1= 0:9.\nOur CLIP model uses a ViT-H/16 [ 13] image encoder that consumes 256\u0002256resolution images, and\nhas width 1280 with 32 Transformer [ 53] blocks. The text encoder also follows the architecture described\nin Radford et al. [ 39]: it is a Transformer [ 53] with a causal attention mask, with width 1024 and 24 Trans-\nformer blocks. Both models are trained with learning rate 3\u000210\u00004and SAM [ 15] with\u001a= 0:1, where the\nperturbations are applied independently by the replicas, each of which uses batch size 64. The remaining\nhyperparameters are the same as those reported in Radford et al. [39].\nWhen training the encoder, we sample from the CLIP [ 39] and DALL-E [ 40] datasets (approximately\n650M images in total) with equal probability.

This would greatly increase the use and accessibility\nof developing 3D assets. Furthermore, if the shape generated is in\nthe form of a mesh with corresponding texture maps it would easily\nfacilitate integration with a large suite of existing game engines and\nsoftware that use 3D meshes as primitives.\nA big limitation is the lack of large varied datasets of 3D ob-\njects and corresponding natural language descriptions. For example,\ndatasets such as Shapenet [Chang et al .2015] and CO3D [Reizenstein\net al.2021] provide 50 object categories respectively. In contrast\nthere are large datasets containing rich 2D images with a large vari-\nety of objects. For example Imagenet-21K [Ridnik et al .2021] has\n21,000 object categories. Furthermore, natural image data can often\nbe accompanied by rich textual descriptions. Recently CLIP has been\ntrained on a large dataset of 400 million image text pairs to learn an\naligned visual and textual representation [Radford et al .2021]. This\ntext and image scoring model was trained on text captions with\ncombinations from a set of 500,000 query words, leading to a very\nlarge diversity in the potential objects it can represent.\nWe thus consider utilizing the knowledge from a large scale deep\nlearning model trained only on images and texts. This relies on the\nfact that a 3D shape can be projected to a 2D image from an arbitrary\nviewpoint through rendering. Using a differentiable renderer such\nas [Laine et al .2020] one can obtain images of a shape and then use\nCLIP to get a score between the images and an input text. Leveraging\nthe differentiability of the renderer and CLIP, an inverse problem\ncan be solved by optimizing the shape and texture of a mesh to\nmaximize the CLIP score of rendered images and input prompt.\nHowever, doing this naively can lead to a tangled and noisy mesh\nas there are insufficient constraints on the shape. Therefore we\nincorporate a number of constraints and techniques that allow us to\ngenerate a plausible shape and texture. First we use a regularization\nloss and incorporate limit subdivision to further smooth the mesh.\nEven though this helps us maximize the score it often leads to an\nundesirable result in terms of texture as CLIP may prefer \"painting\"\nsmall artifacts in to the texture rather than deform and globally\ntexture the object. To alleviate this we use multiple augmentations\nto render the object dynamically such that the", " Introduction\nThe quality of novel view synthesis has been dramatically improved since the introduction [27], NeRF has\nbecome a popular way [5] to model scenes and render them from novel views\nthanks to its high quality rendering.

Various high-performance\nimage-based pose estimators [40,51,48,25,30,29] are proposed in the literature,\nbut they are associated with substantial computational costs.\nThere are two main approaches to improving the e\ufb03ciency of human pose\nestimators so that they can be deployed on resource-scarce edge devices (e.g.,\nsmart cameras). A straightforward way to improve the e\ufb03ciency is designing\nmore compact models, such as numerous light-weighted image-level pose esti-\nmators [3,35,21,61,6,60,42,62,4,18,54] (see Fig. 1(a)(i)) and video-level pose esti-\nmators [41,9] (see Fig. 1(a)(ii)) introduced in previous literature. However, when\nestimating on a video, such approaches inevitably lead to a sub-optimal solu-\ntion for e\ufb03ciency improvement due to the frame-by-frame estimation scheme.\nIn contrast, a promising but rarely explored direction is leveraging the semantic\nredundancy among frames of videos, where we can feed only keyframes to heavyarXiv:2203.08713v2  [cs.CV]  20 Jul 20222 A.

Kucherenko, T., Beskow, J., Kjellstr\u00a8 om, H.:", " INTRODUCTION\nComputer graphics primitives are fundamentally represented by\nmathematical functions that parameterize appearance. The quality\nand performance characteristics of the mathematical representation\nare crucial for visual fidelity: we desire representations that remain\nfast and compact while capturing high-frequency, local detail. Func-\ntions represented by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), used as neural\ngraphics primitives , have been shown to match these criteria (to\nvarying degree), for example as representations of shape [Martel\net al.2021; Park et al .2019] and radiance fields [Liu et al .2020;\nMildenhall et al. 2020; M\u00fcller et al. 2020, 2021].\nThe important commonality of the these approaches is an encod-\ning that maps neural network inputs to a higher-dimensional space,\nwhich is key for extracting high approximation quality from com-\npact models. Most successful among these encodings are trainable,\ntask-specific data structures [Liu et al .2020; Takikawa et al .2021]\nthat take on a large portion of the learning task. This enables the use\nof smaller, more efficient MLPs. However, such data structures rely\non heuristics and structural modifications (such as pruning, split-\nting, or merging) that may complicate the training process, limit\nthe method to a specific task, or limit performance on GPUs where\ncontrol flow and pointer chasing is expensive.\nWe address these concerns with our multiresolution hash encod-\ning, which is adaptive and efficient, independent of the task. It is\nconfigured by just two values\u2014the number of parameters \ud835\udc47and the\ndesired finest resolution \ud835\udc41max\u2014yielding state-of-the-art quality on\na variety of tasks (Figure 1) after a few seconds of training.\nKey to both the task-independent adaptivity and efficiency is a\nmultiresolution hierarchy of hash tables:\n\u2022Adaptivity: we map a cascade of grids to corresponding fixed-\nsize arrays of feature vectors. At coarse resolutions, there is a 1:1\nmapping from grid points to array entries. At fine resolutions, the\narray is treated as a hash table and indexed using a spatial hash\nfunction, where multiple grid points alias each array entry. Such\nhash collisions cause the colliding training gradients to average,\nmeaning that the largest gradients\u2014those most relevant to the\nloss function\u2014will dominate. The hash tables thus automatically\nprioritize the sparse areas with the most important fine scale detail.\nUnlike prior work, no structural updates to the data structure are\nneeded at any point during training.\n\u2022Efficiency: our hash table lookups are O(1)and do not require\ncontrol flow. This maps well to modern GPUs, avoiding execution\ndivergence and serial pointer-chasing inherent in tree traversals.\nThe hash tables for all resolutions may be queried in parallel.\nWe validate our multiresolution hash encoding in four representa-\ntive tasks (see Figure 1):\n(1)Gigapixel image: the MLP learns the mapping from 2D coor-\ndinates to RGB colors of a high-resolution image.\n(2)Neural signed distance functions (SDF): the MLP learns the\nmapping from 3D coordinates to the distance to a surface.\n(3)Neural radiance caching (NRC): the MLP learns the 5D light\nfield of a given scene from a Monte Carlo path tracer.\n(4)Neural radiance and density fields (NeRF): the MLP learns\nthe 3D density and 5D light field of a given scene from image\nobservations and corresponding perspective transforms.In the following, we first review prior neural network encodings\n(Section 2), then we describe our encoding (Section 3) and its imple-\nmentation (Section 4), followed lastly by our experiments. This is 4\u00d7smaller than the batch size chosen in mip-\nNeRF, likely due to the larger number of samples each of their\nrays", " Introduction\nGiven a single video of a human performing an activ-\nity, e.g., a YouTube or TikTok video of a dancer, we would\nlike the ability to pause at any frame and rotate 360 degrees\naround the performer to view them from any angle at that\nmoment in time (Figure 1). This problem \u2013 free-viwepoint\nrendering of a moving subject \u2013 is a longstanding research\nchallenge, as it involves synthesizing previously unseen\ncamera views while accounting for cloth folds, hair move-\nment, and complex body poses [5, 6, 15, 18, 27, 38, 59, 65].\nThe problem is particularly hard for the case of \u201cin-the-\nwild\u201d videos taken with a single camera (monocular video),\nthe case we address in this paper.\nPrevious neural rendering methods that accelerate training of\nneural graphics primitives (e.g., [42]) will help reduce com-\nputation and thus the environmental impact. Finally, our\nmethod will be made available to the public for counter-\nmeasure analysis and computation reduction.Figure 16. Qualitative comparison on the remaining subjects in ZJU-MoCap dataset.\nFigure 17. Optimized canonical appearance on ZJU-MoCap dataset. Related Work\nThe physics of free-viewpoint rendering involves mod-\neling geometry and surface properties and then rendering\nfrom new camera views. However, it remains difficult to\nrecreate complex geometry and subtle lighting effects. Al-\nternatively, image-based rendering [57, 61] offers to render\nnovel views based on given set of views in the image do-\nmain with a large corpus of research over the last couple\ndecades [8, 9, 13, 17, 21, 22, 30, 78].\nHuman specific rendering: The work of Kanade et al.\n[27] is one of the earliest investigations into free-viewpoint\nrendering of humans. It introduced a dome equipped with\ncameras to recover depth maps and meshes, enabling novel\nviews to be rendered by reprojecting and blending differ-\nent views to account for mesh holes due to occlusions.\nLater, Matusik et al. [38] reconstructed a visual hull from\nsilhouettes of the subject and rendered it by carefully se-\nlecting pixels without an auxiliary geometric representation.\nCarranza et al.

As shown in Fig. 14,", " Introduction\nImage synthesis is one of the computer vision \ufb01elds with\nthe most spectacular recent development, but also among\nthose with the greatest computational demands. Espe-\ncially high-resolution synthesis of complex, natural scenes\nis presently dominated by scaling up likelihood-based mod-\nels, potentially containing billions of parameters in autore-\ngressive (AR) transformers [66,67]. In contrast, the promis-\ning Related Work\nGenerative Models for Image Synthesis The high di-\nmensional nature of images presents distinct challenges\nto generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) [27] allow for ef\ufb01cient sampling of high resolution\nimages with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are dif\ufb01-\n2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full\ndata distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth-\nods emphasize good density estimation which renders op-\ntimization more well-behaved. Variational autoencoders\n(V AE) [46] and \ufb02ow-based models [18, 19] enable ef\ufb01cient\nsynthesis of high resolution images [9, 44, 92], but sam-\nple quality is not on par with GANs. While autoregressive\nmodels (ARM) [6, 10, 94, 95] achieve strong performance\nin density estimation, computationally demanding architec-\ntures [97] and a sequential sampling process limit them to\nlow resolution images. Because pixel based representations\nof images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency de-\ntails [16,73], maximum-likelihood training spends a dispro-\nportionate amount of capacity on modeling them, resulting\nin long training times. To scale to higher resolutions, several\ntwo-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model\na compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels.\nRecently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82],\nhave achieved state-of-the-art methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(zjx) =\nN(z;E\u0016;E\u001b2)and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0;1)as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu-\nlarizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of jZjdifferent exemplars [96].\nTo obtain high-\ufb01delity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the\nKLterm by a factor\u001810\u00006or choose a high codebook dimensionality jZj.\nThe full objective to train the autoencoding model (E;D)reads:\nLAutoencoder = min\nE;Dmax\n \u0010\nLrec(x;D(E(x)))\u0000Ladv(D(E(x))) + logD (x) +Lreg(x;E;D)\u0011\n(25)\nDM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two\ncases when learning p(z)orp(zjy)(Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we sample z=E\u0016(x)+E\u001b(x)\u0001\"=:E(x),\nwhere\"\u0018N(0;1). When rescaling the latent, we estimate the component-wise variance\n^\u001b2=1\nbchwX\nb;c;h;w(zb;c;h;w\u0000^\u0016)2\nfrom the \ufb01rst batch in the data, where ^\u0016=1\nbchwP\nb;c;h;wzb;c;h;w. The output ofEis scaled such that the rescaled latent has\nunit standard deviation, i.e.z z\n^\u001b=E(x)\n^\u001b. (ii) For a VQ-regularized latent space, we extract zbefore the quantization layer\nand absorb the quantization operation into the decoder, i.e. it can be interpreted as the \ufb01rst layer of D.\nH. Additional Qualitative Experiments\nLDMs provide means to \ufb02exible and computationally\ntractable diffusion based image synthesis of various image\nmodalities, which we empirically show in the following.\nFirstly, however, we analyze the gains of our models com-\npared to pixel-based diffusion models in both training and\ninference.

Therefore,\na tool capable of generating realistic images from natural\nlanguage can empower humans to create rich and diverse\nvisual content with unprecedented ease. The ability to edit\nimages using natural language further allows for iterative re-\n\ufb01nement and \ufb01ne-grained control, both of which are critical\nfor real world applications.\nRecent text-conditional image models are capable of syn-\nthesizing images from free-form text prompts, and can com-\npose unrelated objects in semantically plausible ways (Xu\net al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2020; Ramesh et al.,\n2021; Zhang et al., 2021). However, they are not yet able\nto generate photorealistic images that capture all aspects of\n\u0003Equal contribution.

Within this line of research, diffusion\nmodels (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2020b)\nhave emerged as a promising family of generative models,\nachieving state-of-the-art sample quality on a number of\nimage generation benchmarks (Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal &\nNichol, 2021; Ho et al., 2021).\nTo achieve photorealism in the class-conditional setting,\nDhariwal & Nichol (2021) augmented diffusion models\nwith classi\ufb01er guidance , a technique which allows diffusion\nmodels to condition on a classi\ufb01er\u2019s labels. The classi\ufb01er\nis \ufb01rst trained on noised images, and during the diffusion\nsampling process, gradients from the classi\ufb01er are used\nto guide the sample towards the label. Ho & Salimans\n(2021) achieved similar results, we follow Avrahami et al. (2021)\nand use CLIP to select the best of 64 samples. Our \ufb01ne-tuned samples have more realistic lighting, shadows and textures, but sometimes\ndon\u2019t focus on the prompt (eg. golden necklace), whereas implicit samples capture the prompt better.\nand then take three crops at the endpoints and middle along\nthe longer side. We feed all three crops into a pre-trained\nCLIP ViT-B/16, and mean-pool the resulting feature vec-\ntors. Finally, we \ufb01t an SVM with an RBF kernel to the\nresulting feature vectors, and tune the bias to result in less\nthan a 1% false negative rate. We tested this model on a\nseparate batch of 1024 samples, and found that it produced\nno false negatives (i.e. we manually visually inspected the\nimages the model classi\ufb01ed as not containing people, and\nwe ourselves found no images of people).\nWhile developing the people \ufb01lter, we were aiming to de-\ntect all people in all types of environments reliably, a task\nwhich is often dif\ufb01cult for modern face detection systems\nespecially when dealing with people of all demographics\n(Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Santurkar et al., 2019).

Games, virtual reality applications and \ufb01lms are each\npopulated with thousands of object models, each designed\nand textured by hand with digital software. While expert\nartists can author high-\ufb01delity assets, the process is painstak-\ningly slow and expensive. Prior work leverages 3D datasets\nto synthesize shapes in the form of point clouds, voxel grids,\ntriangle meshes, and implicit functions using generative mod-\nels like GANs [4, 21, 57, 65]. These approaches only sup-\nport a few object categories due to small labeled 3D shape\ndatasets. But multimedia applications require a wide variety\nof content, and need both 3D geometry and texture.\nIn this work, we propose Dream Fields, a method to\nautomatically generate open-set 3D models from natural\nlanguage prompts. Unlike prior work, our method does\nnot require any 3D training data, and uses natural language\nprompts that are easy to author with an expressive interface\nfor specifying desired object properties. We demonstrate that\nthe compositionality of language allows for \ufb02exible creative\ncontrol over shapes, colors and styles.\nA Dream Field is a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) trained\nto maximize a deep perceptual metric with respect to both\n1arXiv:2112.01455v2  [cs.CV]  4 May 2022the geometry and color of a scene. NeRF and other neural 3D\nrepresentations have recently been successfully applied to\nnovel view synthesis tasks where ground-truth RGB photos\nare available. NeRF is trained to reconstruct images from\nmultiple viewpoints. As the learned radiance \ufb01eld is shared\nacross viewpoints, NeRF can interpolate between viewpoints\nsmoothly and consistently. Due to its neural representation,\nNeRF can be sampled at high spatial resolutions unlike voxel\nrepresentations and point clouds, and are easy to optimize\nunlike explicit geometric representations like meshes as it is\ntopology-free.\nHowever, existing photographs are not available when\ncreating novel objects from descriptions alone. Instead of\nlearning to reconstruct known input photos, we learn a radi-\nance \ufb01eld such that its renderings have high semantic similar-\nity with a given text prompt. We extract these semantics with\npre-trained neural image-text retrieval models like CLIP [46],\nlearned from hundreds of millions of captioned images. As\nNeRF\u2019s volumetric rendering and CLIP\u2019s image-text repre-\nsentations are differentiable, we can optimize Dream Fields\nend-to-end for each prompt. Figure 1 illustrates our method.\nIn results for this ablation optimize CLIP ViT\nB/16.\nThe 2D image is an RGB \u000bpixel grid, composited\nwith random backgrounds during optimization similar to\nDream Fields. Optimizing a single 2D RGB \u000bimage does\nnot produce a multi-view consistent 3D object, so other\nviewpoints cannot be rendered. Even with transmittance\nand TV regularization, the resulting image is noisy.\nThe voxel grid stores 1283RGB and alpha values, in-\nterpolated trilinearly at ray sample points and composited\nwithout a neural network using the PyTorch3D library. De-\nspite the transmittance loss, data augmentations and scene\nbounds, the voxel grid also has signi\ufb01cant low-density\nartifacts. The voxel baseline has CLIP B/32 R-Precision\n37.0% \u00063.9, while NeRF has 59.8% \u00062.8(Tables 1, 3) with\n16\u0002fewer parameters, showing that the neural represen-\ntation improves consistency with the input caption in a\ngeneralizable way.

This issue partially mo-\ntivated the construction of our own dataset, in which great care is\ntaken to prevent such photometric variation.\n14SVS\n Our Model w/GLO\nM60 Playground Train Truck\nFigure 12. A visualization of our model with Stable View Synthesis [41] on scenes from the Tanks and Temples dataset [25]. Image\nquality is roughly comparable across the two techniques, though our renderings exhibits different failure modes than SVS\u2019s in the absence\nof observations (as in M60) and, because our model neutralizes most photometric variation during training, our renderings may have a\ndifferent global brightness or color shift (as in Train ).\nror metrics: before evaluating each metric we solve a per-\nimage least squares problem that \ufb01ts a quadratic polynomial\nexpansion of the rendering\u2019s RGB values to the true image,\nwhile ignoring saturated pixels. This partially reduces the\neffect of photometric variation on this data, and yields re-\nsults in which SVS and our model (with GLO) are roughly\nquantitatively comparable.\nWhen using these color-corrected metrics, our model\nslightly outperforms SVS in terms of PSNR, but under-\nperforms SVS on SSIM and LPIPS. With this in mind, it\nis worth reiterating the advantages that SVS has over our\nmodel on this benchmark: 1) SVS has been trained on the\ntraining set of this dataset, while our model does not use\nthat external training data \u2014 and indeed uses no external\ntraining data at all. 2) SVS relies on a proxy geometry pro-\nduced by an external system (and may fail when that ge-\nometry is incorrect), while we use no proxy geometry and\nin fact produce high-quality depth maps ourselves. 3) SVS\nhas been trained with a perceptual loss, while our model is\ntrained using only a per-pixel loss on RGB. 4) Our model\nis extremely compact, and requires only 10 million parame-\nters to perform view synthesis, while SVS requires multiple\nlarge CNNs and access to all training images (because it op-\nerates by blending training images together) to render novel\nviews.\nFrom Table 7 we see that our model\u2019s improvement over\nSVS is most signi\ufb01cant on the playground scene. Notably,\nthis is the only test-set scene that mostly consists of natural\ncontent, while the other three scenes predominately feature\nlarge vehicles. We speculate that SVS may be better-suited\nto large piecewise planar objects (which makes sense, given\nSVS\u2019s reliance on a proxy geometry that is itself a piecewise\nplanar mesh) while ours may be better suited to scenes that\ncontain natural content (trees, grass, \ufb02owers, etc).E. Potential Negative Impact\nThe broad use of neural rendering techniques carries\nwith it several potential negative societal impacts. NeRF-\nlike models have recently been incorporated into generative\nmodeling approaches [15], and generative modeling tech-\nniques can be used to synthesize \u201cdeep fakes\u201d that could\nbe used to mislead people. Though our work does not di-\nrectly concern generative modeling and instead aims to re-\nconstruct accurate physical models of a scene from which\nnew views can be generated, our contributions may be use-\nful for generative approaches that build on NeRF.\nThe ability to reconstruct accurate models of a scene\nfrom photographs may have modest potential negative im-\npacts. Our technique could conceivably be used to construct\na surveillance system, and such a system could have nega-\ntive impact if", " Introduction\nFields such as simulation, architecture, gaming, and \ufb01lm rely on high-quality 3D content with rich\ngeometric details and complex topology. However, creating such content requires tremendous expert\nhuman effort. It takes a signi\ufb01cant amount of development time to create each individual 3D asset. In\ncontrast, creating rough 3D shapes with simple building blocks like voxels has been widely adopted.\nFor example, Minecraft has been used by hundreds of millions of users for creating 3D content. Most\nof them are non-experts. Developing A.I. tools that enable regular people to upscale coarse, voxelized\nobjects into high resolution, beautiful 3D shapes would bring us one step closer to democratizing\nhigh-quality 3D content creation. Similar tools can be envisioned for turning 3D scans of objects\nrecorded by modern phones into high-quality forms. Our work aspires to create such capabilities.\nA powerful 3D representation is a critical component of a learning-based 3D content creation\nframework. A good 3D representation for high-quality reconstruction and synthesis should capture\nlocal geometric details and represent objects with arbitrary topology while also being memory and\ncomputationally ef\ufb01cient for fast inference in interactive applications.\nRecently, neural implicit representations [ 8,39,42,51], which use a neural network to implicitly\nrepresent a shape via a signed distance \ufb01eld (SDF) or an occupancy \ufb01eld (OF), have emerged as\nan effective 3D representation. Neural implicits have the bene\ufb01t of representing complex geometry\n35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).arXiv:2111.04276v1  [cs.CV]  8 Nov 2021and topology, not limited to a prede\ufb01ned resolution. The success of these methods, con\ufb01rmed by quantitative metrics and an extensive\nuser study. By showcasing the ability to upscale coarse voxels such as Minecraft shapes, we hope\nthat we take one step closer to democratizing 3D content creation.\n6 Broad Impact\nMany \ufb01elds such as AR/VR, robotics, architecture, gaming and \ufb01lm rely on high-quality 3D content.\nCreating such content, however, requires human experts, i.e., experienced artists, and a signi\ufb01cant\namount of development time. In contrast, platforms like Minecraft enable millions of users around the\nworld to carve out coarse shapes with simple blocks. Our work aims at creating A.I. tools that would\nenable even novice users to upscale simple, low-resolution shapes into high resolution, beautiful 3D\ncontent.

In the last\ndecades models of varying degrees of realism have been\nsuccessfully deployed e.g. for 3D human motion analysis\n[48], 3D human pose and shape reconstruction [25, 54], per-\nsonal avatar creation [3, 56], medical diagnosis and treat-\nment [17], or image synthesis and video editing [55, 22].\nModern statistical body models are typically learnt from\nlarge collections of 3D scans of real people, which are used\nto capture the body shape variations among the human pop-\nulation. Dynamic scans, when available, can be used to fur-\nther model how different poses affect the deformation of the\nmuscles and the soft-tissue of the human body.\nThe recently released GHUM model [51] follows this\nmethodology by describing the human body, its shape vari-\nation, articulated pose including fingers, and facial ex-\npressions as a moderate resolution mesh based on a low-\ndimensional, partly interpretable parameterization. In the\n*The first two authors contributed equally.\nFigure 1. imGHUM is the first parametric full human body model\nrepresented as an implicit signed distance function. imGHUM\nsuccessfully models broad variations in pose, shape, and facial ex-\npressions. The level sets of imGHUM are shown in blue-scale.\ndeep learning literature GHUM and similar models [29, 24]\nare typically used as fixed function layers. This means that\nthe model is parameterized with the output of a neural net-\nwork or some other non-linear function, and the resulting\nmesh is used to compute the final function value. While\nthis approach works well for several tasks, including, more\nrecently, 3D reconstruction, the question of how to best rep-\nresent complex 3D deformable and articulated structures is\nopen. Recent work dealing with the 3D visual reconstruc-\ntion of general objects aimed to represent the output not as\nmeshes but as implicit functions [30, 34, 7, 31]. Such ap-\nproaches thus describe surfaces by the zero-level-set (deci-\nsion boundary) of a function over points in 3D-space. This\nhas clear benefits as the output is neither constrained by a\ntemplate mesh topology, nor is it discretized and thus of\nfixed spatial resolution.\nIn this work, we investigate the possibility to learn a\ndata-driven statistical body model as an implicit function.\nGiven the maturity of state of the art explicit human models,\nit is crucial that an equivalent implicit representation main-\ntains their key, attractive properties \u2013 representing compa-\nrable variation in shape and pose and similar level of detail.\nThis is challenging since recently-proposed implicit func-\ntion networks tend to produce overly smooth shapes and\nfail for articulated humans [8]. We propose a novel net-\nwork architecture and a learning paradigm that enable, for\nthe first time, constructing detailed generative models of hu-\nman pose, shape, and semantics, represented as Signed Dis-\ntance Functions (SDFs) (see fig. 1).

Recent works represent surfaces as\nsigned distance functions (SDF) [ 49,52,17,23] or occupancy [ 30,31]. To train their neural models,\nthese results on the DTU dataset.\n23 introduction, it can handle sudden depth changes\nand synthesize high-quality images. However, extracting high-\ufb01delity surface from the learned\nimplicit \ufb01eld is dif\ufb01cult because the density-based scene representation lacks suf\ufb01cient constraints\non its level sets. In contrast, our method combines the advantages of surface rendering based and\nvolume rendering based background\nby NeRF++ [ 53]. Our network architecture\nand initialization scheme are similar to those\nof IDR [ 49]. More details of the network archi-\ntecture and training parameters can be found in\nthe supplementary material.\n4.2 Comparisons\nWe conducted the comparisons in two settings,\nwith mask supervision (w/ mask) and without mask supervision (w/o mask). We measure the\nreconstruction quality with the Chamfer distances in the same way as UNISURF [31] and IDR [49]\nand report the scores in Table 1. The Conclusion\nWe have proposed NeuS , a new approach to multiview surface reconstruction that represents 3D\nsurfaces as neural SDF and developed a new volume rendering method for training the implicit SDF\nrepresentation. NeuS produces high-quality reconstruction and successfully reconstructs objects with\nsevere occlusions and complex structures. It outperforms the state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. One limitation of our method is that although our method does not heavily rely on\ncorrespondence matching of texture features, the performance would still degrade for textureless\nobjects (we show the failure cases in the supplementary material). Moreover, NeuS has only a single\nscale parameter sthat is used to model the standard deviation of the probability distribution for all\nthe spatial location. Hence, an interesting future research topic is to model the probability with\ndifferent variances for different spatial locations together with the optimization of scene representation,\ndepending on different local geometric characteristics. Negative societal impact: like many other\nlearning-based works, our method requires a large amount of computational resources for network\ntraining, which can be a concern for global climate change.\n10Acknowlegements\nWe thank Michael Oechsle for providing the References\n[1]Matan Atzmon and Yaron Lipman.

Poxels: Probabilistic", " Introduction\nFigure 1: Selected samples from our best ImageNet 512 \u0002512 model (FID 3.85)\nOver the past few years, generative models have gained the ability to generate human-like natural\nlanguage [ 6], in\ufb01nite high-quality synthetic images [ 5,28,51] and highly diverse human speech and\nmusic [ 64,13]. These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text\nprompts [ 72,50] or learning useful feature representations [ 14,7]. While these models are already\n\u0003Equal contributionarXiv:2105.05233v4  [cs.LG]  1 Jun 2021capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond\nthe current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic\ndesign, games, music production, and countless other \ufb01elds.\nGANs [ 19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [ 5,68,28] as measured\nby sample quality metrics such as FID [ 23], Inception Score [ 54] and Precision [ 32]. However, some\nof these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity\nthan state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [ 51,43,42]. Furthermore, GANs are often dif\ufb01cult to\ntrain, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4].\nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them dif\ufb01cult to scale and apply to\nnew domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with\nlikelihood-based models [ 51,25,42,9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically\neasier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore,\nexcept for V AEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time.\nDiffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models which have recently been shown to produce\nhigh-quality images [ 56,59,25] while offering desirable properties such as distribution coverage,\na stationary training objective, and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually\nremoving noise from a signal, and their training objective can be expressed as a reweighted variational\nlower-bound [ 25]. This class of models already holds the state-of-the-art [ 60] on CIFAR-10 [ 31], but\nstill lags behind GANs on dif\ufb01cult generation datasets like LSUN and ImageNet. Nichol and Dhariwal\n[43] found that these models improve reliably with increased compute, and can produce high-quality\nsamples even on the dif\ufb01cult ImageNet 256 \u0002256 dataset using an upsampling stack. However, the\nFID of this model is still not competitive with BigGAN-deep [5], the current state-of-the-art on this\ndataset.\nWe hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors:\n\ufb01rst, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and\nre\ufb01ned; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for \ufb01delity, producing high quality samples\nbut not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these bene\ufb01ts to diffusion models, \ufb01rst by\nimproving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for \ufb01delity.\nWith these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different\nmetrics and datasets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion\nmodels based on Ho et al. [ 25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [ 43] and Song\net al.

(2015) introduced diffusion probabilis-\ntic models, a class of generative models which match a\ndata distribution by learning to reverse a gradual, multi-step\nnoising process. More recently, Ho et al. (2020) showed\nan equivalence between denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels (DDPM) and score based generative models (Song\n& Ermon, 2019; 2020), which learn a gradient of the log-\ndensity of the data distribution using denoising score match-\ning (Hyv \u00a8arinen, 2005). It has recently been shown that this\nclass of models can produce high-quality images (Ho et al.,\n2020; Song & Ermon, 2020; Jolicoeur-Martineau et al.,\n2020) and audio (Chen et al., 2020b; Kong et al., 2020),\nbut it has yet to be shown that DDPMs can achieve log-\nlikelihoods competitive with other likelihood-based models\nsuch as autoregressive models (van den Oord et al., 2016c)\nand V AEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013). This raises various\nquestions, such as whether DDPMs are capable of capturing\nall the modes of a distribution. Furthermore, while Ho et al.\n*Equal contribution1OpenAI, San Francisco, USA.

In our experiments, we\ncorrected for this difference by using more dropout for our\ncosine models than the linear models. We suspect that the\nover\ufb01tting from the cosine schedule is either due to 1) less\nnoise in the cosine schedule providing less regularization,\nor 2) the cosine schedule making optimization, and thus\nover\ufb01tting, easier.G.

In NLP, the\nsize of pre-training data sources for training deep language\nmodels rose from the 20GB BooksCorpus [90]+English\nWikipedia in BERT[25], to the 570GB dataset in GPT-\n3 [12] and the 745GB C4 dataset in T5 [66].\n1arXiv:2102.08981v2  [cs.CV]  30 Mar 2021In contrast, V+L datasets are limited in two ways.\nFirst, the effective sizes of popular V+L datasets are low.\nThe number of images in these datasets range from fewer\nthan a few hundred thousands [84, 20, 44, 28] to sev-\neral millions [70], with lower text quality as the scale in-\ncreases. Second, many of the small-sized datasets share the\nsame, limited visual domain; COCO-Captions [20], Visual\nGenome [44], and VQA2 [27] are (mostly) based on sev-\neral hundreds thousand of COCO images [52]. The lack\nin scale and diversity of visual concepts (with respect to\nvision/language-only counterparts) makes it hard for V+L\nmodels to perform adequately in the wild.\nOne major reason for these gaps is the dif\ufb01culty in\ncollecting such datasets. Unlike in image classi\ufb01cation,\n\u201ctext\u201d in V+L datasets is longer and less likely to be\nagreed upon, making the annotation process more costly\nand time-consuming. One approach to remedy this is to\nmake use of large amounts of the alt-texts accompanying\nimages on the Web. For instance, Sharma et al. intro-\nduced Conceptual", "ABSTRACT\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved high qual-\nity image generation without adversarial training, yet they require simulating a\nMarkov chain for many steps in order to produce a sample. To accelerate sam-\npling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more ef\ufb01cient\nclass of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as\nDDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is de\ufb01ned as the reverse of a particular\nMarkovian diffusion process. We generalize DDPMs via a class of non-Markovian\ndiffusion processes that lead to the same training objective. These non-Markovian\nprocesses can correspond to generative processes that are deterministic, giving rise\nto implicit models that produce high quality samples much faster. We empirically\ndemonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples 10\u0002to50\u0002faster in\nterms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation\nfor sample quality, perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly\nin the latent space, and reconstruct observations with very low error.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nDeep generative models have demonstrated the ability to produce high quality samples in many\ndomains (Karras et al., 2020; van den Oord et al., 2016a).

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse\nimplication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational\ninference to train a Langevin-like sampler.

If digitizing an entire object in\n3D would be as simple as taking a picture, there would be\nno need for sophisticated 3D scanning devices, multi-view\nstereo algorithms, or tedious capture procedures, where a\nsensor needs to be moved around.\nFor certain domain-speci\ufb01c objects, such as faces, human\nbodies, or known man made objects, it is already possible\nto infer relatively accurate 3D surfaces from images with\nthe help of parametric models, data-driven techniques, or\ndeep neural networks.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2. Related Work\n\n\n2.1. Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), became one of the most popular implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such as polygon mesh or voxels. In our research, we use the \u201dnerfacto\u201d model implemented by Nerfstudio (Tancik et\u00a0al., 2023), which is a combination of modular features from multiple papers (Wang et\u00a0al., 2021; Barron et\u00a0al., 2022; M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et\u00a0al., 2021; Verbin et\u00a0al., 2022)\n, designed to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Diffusion Models\n\nDiffusion", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)\u00a0[14] inpainting involves the removal of undesired regions from a 3D scene, with the objective of completing these regions in a contextually coherent, visually plausible, geometrically accurate, and consistent manner across multiple views.\nThis form of 3D editing holds significant value for diverse applications, including 3D content creation and virtual/augmented reality.\n\n\nInpainting on NeRF scenes presents two intricate challenges:\n(i) how to ensure that the same region observed in multiple views is completed in a consistent way, especially when the view changes significantly;\nand (ii) inpainting must address not only the 2D appearance of NeRFs but also yield geometrically valid completion.\n\n\nSeveral NeRF inpainting techniques have been developed to address specific aspects of these challenges\u00a0[17, 35, 16, 38, 37, 10]. The majority of these approaches heavily rely on explicit RGB and depth inpainting priors, often employing 2D inpainters like LaMa\u00a0[27] to independently inpaint all views and subsequently address the multi-view inconsistency.\nFor example, SPIn-NeRF\u00a0[17] and InpaintNeRF360\u00a0[30] incorporate a perceptual loss within masked regions to account for low-level inconsistency, but the perceptual-level inconsistency still cannot be fully addressed (see from Fig.\u00a01 (b)(e)).\nAnother approach involves preventing inconsistent and incorrect views from being used in NeRF optimization. To achieve this, Weder et al.\u00a0[35] introduce uncertainty variables to model the confidence of 2D inpainting results, facilitating automated view selection.\nAs a simpler alternative, Mirzaei et al.\u00a0[16] propose to use a single inpainted reference view to guide the entire scene inpainting process. However, this method is difficult to adapt to scenes with large view variations and requires non-trivial depth alignment. In summary, these methods remain constrained by the capabilities of underlying 2D inpainters. Besides, they share the common limitation of neglecting the correlation between\ninpainted RGB images and inpainted depth maps, resulting in less pleasing geometry completion.\n\n\nIn this work, we are interested in addressing these challenges via a new paradigm.\nInstead of employing 2D inpainting independently for each view, we believe that ideally, the inpainting at different views should work jointly to reach a solution that i) fulfills the 2D inpainting goal at each view and ii) ensures 3D consistency.\nFortunately, 2D diffusion models present an ideal prior for achieving this goal.\nWhile recent advances like DreamFusion\u00a0[19] have demonstrated their capability in 3D generation, the adaptation of diffusion priors to tackle the NeRF inpainting problem remains an untapped area.\n\n\nTo this end, we present MVIP-NeRF, a novel approach that performs multiview-consistent inpainting in NeRF scenes via diffusion priors.\nGiven an RGB sequence and per-frame masks specifying the region to be removed, we train a NeRF using a reconstruction loss in the observed region and an inpainting loss in the masked region.\nThe inpainting loss is based on the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)\u00a0[19] that attempts to align each rendered view with the text-conditioned diffusion prior.\nThis approach allows our model to progressively fill the missing regions in the shared 3D space, thus the inpainting goal at multiple views can work jointly to reach a consistent 3D inpainting solution.\nTo further ensure a valid and coherent geometry in the inpainted region, we also adopt diffusion priors to optimize the rendered normal maps.\nIn addition, observing that the stochasticity of SDS often", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecent developments in 3D representation\u00a0[4, 96, 65, 45] have highlighted 3D Gaussians\u00a0[45, 93, 102, 14, 107] as an essential approach for novel view synthesis, owing to the ability to produce photorealistic images with impressive rendering speed. 3D Gaussians offer explicit representation and the capability for real-time processing, which significantly enhances the practicality of editing 3D scenes. The study of how to editing 3D Gaussians is becoming increasingly vital, particularly for interactive downstream applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). Our research focuses on the inpainting tasks that are crucial for the seamless integration of edited elements, effectively filling in missing parts and serving as a foundational operation for further manipulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: We present InFusion, an innovative approach that delivers efficient, photorealistic inpainting for 3D scenes with 3D Gaussians. As demonstrated in (a), InFusion enables the seamless removal of 3D objects, along with user-friendly texture editing and object insertion. Illustrated in (b), InFusion learns depth completion with diffusion prior, significantly enhancing the depth inpainting quality for general objects. We show the visualizations of the unprojected points, which exhibit substantial improvements over baseline models\u00a0[92, 44].\n\n\n\n\nInitial explorations into 3D Gaussian inpainting have focused on growing Gaussians from the boundary of the uninpainted regions, using inpainted 2D multiview images for guidance\u00a0[106, 13, 29]. This method, however, tends to produce blurred textures due to inconsistencies in the generation process, and the growing can be quite slow. Notably, the training quality for Gaussian models is significantly improved when the initial points are precisely positioned within the 3D scene, particularly on object surfaces. A practical solution to improve the fine-tuning of Gaussians is to predetermine these initial points where inpainting will occur, thereby simplifying the overall training process. In allocating initial points for Gaussian inpainting, the role of depth map inpainting can be pivotal. The ability to convert inpainted depth maps into point clouds facilitates a seamless transition to 3D space, while also leveraging the potential to train on expansive datasets\u00a0[62, 63, 84].\n\n\nTo this end, we introduce InFusion, an innovative approach to 3D Gaussian inpainting that leverages depth completion learned from diffusion models\u00a0[1, 9, 75, 79]. Our method demonstrates that with a robustly learned depth inpainting model, we can accurately determine the placement of initial points, significantly elevating both the fidelity and efficiency of 3D Gaussian inpainting. In particular, we first inpaint the depth in the reference view, then unproject the points into the 3D space to achieve optimal initialization. However, current depth inpainting methodologies\u00a0[92, 44, 67, 106] are often a limiting factor; commonly, they lack the generality required to accurately complete object depth, or they produce depth maps that misalign with the original, with errors amplified during unprojection. In this work, we harness the power of pre-trained latent diffusion models, training our depth inpainting model with diffusion-based priors to substantially enhance the quality of our inpainting results. The model exhibits a marked improvement in aligning with the unpainted regions and in reconstructing the depth of objects. This enhanced alignment capability ensures a more coherent extension of the existing geometry into the inpainted areas, leading to", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe recent progress in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based methods\u00a0[31, 33, 7] has now made it possible to reconstruct and render natural 3D environments with an ease and visual quality that has previously not been possible with traditional 3D representations. That said, traditional 3D representations like textured meshes explicitly decouple geometry and appearance; this gives artists, albeit with significant skill and time, the ability to make complex edits to 3D scenes and produce visually compelling results. This task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with NeRFs because they lack explicit representations of surfaces and appearances.\n\n\nAt the same time, image synthesis and editing have been revolutionized by 2D diffusion-based generative models\u00a0[42, 43, 38]. These models can generate (or edit) images using text prompts, inpaint masked regions in images\u00a0[1] or edit images following user instructions\u00a0[5]. In cases where text prompts are not a fine-grained enough edit modality, approaches such as ControlNet\u00a0[57] enable the generation and editing of content conditioned on spatial guidance signals, including but not limited to depth, edges, and segmentation maps.\n\n\nRecent work has explored using such 2D diffusion models to edit 3D NeRF scenes\u00a0[13, 48]. However, editing individual images of the same scene (with diffusion models or otherwise) produces inconsistent results that require different forms of regularization [47, 30] and/or relying on the NeRF optimization to resolve\u00a0[13]. This is successful only up to a point; for example, as can be seen in Fig.\u00a01 (top), even the state-of-the-art Instruct-NeRF2NeRF method\u00a0[13] suffers from errors in geometry, blurry textures, and poor text alignment.\n\n\nWe address this challenge using DATENeRF, a Depth-Aware Text-Editing method that uses the reconstructed NeRF geometry to improve the consistency of individual 2D edits. We propose using ControlNet\u00a0[57], conditioned on the NeRF depth, as the base 2D diffusion model for text editing. This depth conditioning improves the geometric alignment of edited images but they can still have very different appearance. To address this, we propose reprojecting edited pixels in one view onto the next view using the NeRF depth. Doing this naively produces poor results because errors in geometry and resampling issues aggregate over views. Instead, we use the reprojected pixels to initialize a hybrid inpainting step that inpaints disoccluded pixels but also refines the entire image to produces 2D images that are both high-quality and consistent.\n\n\nThis improved consistency means that the edited images can be easily fused by a subsequent NeRF optimization to produce a high-quality edited NeRF scene. As can be seen in Fig.\u00a01 (bottom), DATENeRF produces results that have cleaner geometry and more detailed textures compared to Instruct-NeRF2NeRF which blurs these details out because of the inconsistencies in 2D edits.\nMoreover, by incorporating ControlNet into NeRF editing, we open up a broad spectrum of fine-grained NeRF modification capabilities, encompassing both edge-based scene alterations and the insertion of objects, as showcased in Fig.\u00a07 and\u00a08, respectively. This integration enhances the controlability of scene editing.\n\n \n\n2 Related Work\n\nNeRF Editing. While there has been extensive research, and even development of commercial software tools for editing 3D content, these have been traditionally applied to textured meshes or point clouds.

We propose to disentangle the appearance from the geometry for 3D-GS, thereby facilitating real-time appearance editing such as texture swapping. The rendering speed is shown in each result.\n\n\nReconstruction, editing, and real-time rendering of photo-realistic scenes are fundamental problems in computer vision and graphics, with diverse applications such as film production, computer games, and virtual/augmented reality.\nPolygonal meshes have served as the standard 3D representation within traditional rendering pipelines, owing to their rendering speed and editing flexibility (with texture mapping).\n\n\nDue to the laborious process of manual mesh-based scene modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting\u00a0[13] (3D-GS) has gained considerable attention for its capability of faithfully reconstructing complex scenes from multi-view images and real-time rendering.\n3D-GS represents the scene as a set of 3D anisotropic Gaussians equipped with per-Gaussian color attributes and supports real-time rendering by splatting these Gaussians onto the image plane.\nHowever, this representation couples the appearance and geometry of the scene within the unordered and irregular 3D Gaussians, which hinders the flexibility of appearance editing for 3D-GS compared to meshes, where appearance can be easily parameterized into texture maps.\nAlthough considerable efforts have been made to edit 3D Gaussian-based scenes\u00a0[28, 3, 7, 24, 14], the manipulation of appearance remains inconvenient since these works still follow the entangled representation of 3D-GS.\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method, named Texture-GS, which aims to explicitly disentangle the geometry and texture for 3D-GS, thereby significantly improving the flexibility of appearance editing for 3D scenes.\nTexture-GS follows 3D-GS in modeling the geometry as a set of anisotropic 3D Gaussians, but crucially, it represents the view independent appearance as a 2D texture map.\nLeveraging this disentangled representation, Texture-GS retains the powerful capabilities of 3D-GS for faithful reconstruction and real-time rendering, while also facilitating various appearance editing applications, such as texture swapping shown in Fig.\u00a01.\n\n\nThe key challenge in implementing our Texture-GS lies in establishing a connection between the geometry (3D Gaussians) and appearance (2D texture map).\nNeuTex\u00a0[23] has proposed a texture mapping MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) that regresses 2D UV coordinates for every 3D point to represent the radiance of NeRF (Neural Radiance Field)\u00a0[16] in a 2D texture space.\nHowever, evaluating an MLP for each ray-Gaussian intersection is unsuitable for our Texture-GS, as it would be prohibitively\nexpensive for real-time rendering, which is a key advantage of 3D-GS over NeRF-based methods.\nTo maintain the ability of real-time rendering, one straightforward solution is to employ a texture mapping MLP to pre-compute UV coordinates for each Gaussian based on its center location and then query the per-Gaussian color attributes from the texture map before rendering.\nGiven the fact that each 3D Gaussian often covers more than one pixel in practice, this straightforward solution would result in all pixels covered by a single Gaussian being mapped to the same UV location, leading to discontinuities in the texture space.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel texture mapping module.\nIt incorporates an MLP for mapping Gaussian centers into the texture UV space before rendering, along with a Taylor expansion at the Gaussian centers, which serves an approximation of the MLP and enables efficient mapping of the ray-Gaussian intersections", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe explosion of new social media platforms and display devices has sparked a surge in demand for high-quality 3D content. From immersive games and movies to cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) applications, there is an increasing need for efficient tools for creating and editing 3D content. While there has been significant progress in 3D reconstruction and generation, 3D editing remain a less-studied area. In this work, we focus on 3D scene manipulation by replacing current objects in the scene with new contents with only natural language prompts from a user. Imagine putting on a VR headset and trying to remodel one\u2019s living room. One can swap out the current sofa with a sleek new design, add some lush greenery, or remove clutter to create a more spacious feel.\n\n\nIn this project, we introduce the ReplaceAnything3D model (RAM3D), a text-guided Erase-and-Replace method for scene editing. RAM3D takes multiview images of a static scene as input, along with text prompts specifying which object to erase and what should replace it. Our approach comprises four key steps: 1) we use LangSAM\u00a0[24] with the text prompts to detect and segment the object to be erased. 2) To erase the object, we propose a text-guided 3D inpainting technique to fill in the background region obscured by the removed object. 3) Next, a similar text-guided 3D inpainting technique is used to generate a new object(s) that matches the input text description. Importantly, this is done such that the mass of the object is minimal. 4) Finally, the newly generated object is seamlessly composited onto the inpainted background in training views to obtain consistent multiview images of an edited 3D scene. Then a NeRF\u00a0[26] can be trained on these new multiview images to obtain a 3D representation of the edited scene for novel view synthesis. We show that this compositional structure greatly improves the visual quality of both the background and foreground in the edited scene.\n\n\nCompared to 2D images, replacing objects in 3D scenes is much more challenging due to the requirement for multi-view consistency. Naively applying 2D methods for masking and inpainting leads to incoherent results due to visual inconsistencies in each inpainted viewpoint.\nTo address this challenge, we propose combining the prior knowledge of large-scale image diffusion models, specifically a text-guided image inpainting model, with learned 3D scene representations.\nTo generate new multi-view consistent 3D objects, we adapt Hifa [57], a text-to-3D distillation approach, to our 3D inpainting framework. Compared to pure text-to-3D approaches, ReplaceAnything3D needs to generate new contents that not only follow the input text prompt but also are compatible with the appearance of the rest of the scene. By combining a pre-trained text-guided image inpainting model with a compositional scene structure, ReplaceAnything3D can generate coherent edited 3D scenes with new objects seamlessly blended with the rest of the original scene.\n\n\nIn summary, our contributions are:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe introduce an Erase-and-Replace approach to 3D scene editing that enables the replacement of\nspecific objects within a scene at high-resolutions.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a multi-stage approach that enables not only object replacement but also removal and multiple object additions.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe demonstrate that", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe recent advancement of computer vision has been largely relying on the scaling of training data\u00a0[26, 53]. The same success in data-driven approaches has been recently adopted to 3D object modeling with new large 3D object-centric dataset collection\u00a0[40, 52, 25]. Most of the large datasets are synthetic 3D data\u00a0[5, 22, 76, 14] and a mix of synthetic data and real-world object scans\u00a0[16], given it is much less labor intensive for scaling by rendering from simulation. However, it remains a big challenge to apply the model trained in simulation data to the real world. This is not only because the synthetic data has less realistic texture and shape, but also due to it is very hard to model the cluttered background and the natural light comes with it in simulation.\n\n\nTo make deep learning with 3D objects applicable in the real world, researchers have made efforts to collect real-world multiview object data\u00a0[54, 2]. For example, the CO3D dataset\u00a0[54] contains 19K object videos across 50 categories. However, due to the lack of depth, they require the use of COLMAP\u00a0[56] to provide 3D annotations, which only works for 20%percent2020\\%20 % of the collected videos. Collecting the depth channel part of the data is not only useful for more accurate 3D ground-truth annotations, but also provides very useful information for downstream applications such as object 6D pose estimation and novel view synthesis. The OmniObject3D dataset\u00a0[75] provides both object videos and a separate scanning of the objects. However, the collected videos do not come with the depth channel inputs and they are mostly taken with clean backgrounds. The Wild6D dataset\u00a0[23] is one of the few recent efforts to collect RGB-D object videos taken in the wild. However, it only contains 6 categories of data and covers relatively smaller ranges of object views.\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose to collect a new dataset that contains large-scale RGB-D object videos across diverse object categories and presented in the wild. Our dataset, namely WildRGB-D, covers 8500 tabletop objects across 44 categories in 20K videos. The videos are taken using iPhones to go around the objects in 360 degrees (see Figure\u00a02 for visualization). Examples of the dataset are shown in Figure\u00a01. There are three types of videos: (i) Single object video where there is only one object presented on the table; (ii) Multi-object video where there are multiple objects presented at the same time; and (iii) Hand-object video where there is a static human hand grasping the object. More video types add variety, creating occlusion for objects in scenes, which are worthy study cases in some tasks. The collection of the WildRGB-D\u00a0 dataset not only considers the cluttered background in the real world, but also the common scenarios where the objects are occluded by human hands.\n\n\nWe perform automatic annotations for WildRGB-D. With RGB-D capturing, we can apply the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\u00a0[19, 58] (SLAM) algorithms, and exploit the RGB images and depth information from the depth sensor of mobile phones to reconstruct the 3D camera poses in real-world scale and aggregated 3D point clouds. Additionally, center object segmentation masks can be", " INTRODUCTION\nToday we are witnessing the emergence of Neural Implicit Fields [Liu\net al.2020; Mildenhall et al .2020; Sitzmann et al .2019] as an emerg-\ning content medium revolutionizing the way that is revolutionizing\nthe way humans create and interact with 3D content. Its remarkable\nability to model complex 3D scenes and render their photo-realistic\nnovel views has led to its adoption in a wide range of practical\napplications including VR/AR\u2217, gaming\u2020, VFX\u2021, among others.\nWith that comes increasing demands from creators to edit the neural\nimplicit fields according to their preferences. However, editing such\nvolumetric representations is challenging due to the implicit encod-\ning of scene appearance within neural features and network weights,\nwhich can hardly support intuitive and precise modifications. Re-\ncent research has sought to address this by enabling appearance\nediting of neural implicit fields, guided by various inputs such as\nan exemplar image [Bao et al .2023; Kobayashi et al .2022; Liu et al .\n2021; Wang et al .2022; Yang et al .2022], a text prompt [Bao et al .\n2023; Haque et al .2023; Jiang et al .2023; Kobayashi et al .2022; Wang\net al.2022, 2023], or a palette [Gong et al .2023; Kuang et al .2023;\n\u2217https://www.lifewire.com/nvidias-instant-nerf-can-turn-your-phots-into-3d-scenes-\nin-seconds-5224116\n\u2020https://neuralradiancefields.io/nerfs-in-unreal-engine-5-alpha-announced-by-luma-\nai\n\u2021https://www.wrapbook.com/blog/neural-radiance-fieldsarXiv:2312.02157v1  [cs.CV]  4 Dec 2023111:2 \u2022Can Wang, Mingming He, Menglei Chai, Dongdong Chen, and Jing Liao\nWu et al .2022]. These approaches primarily focus on editing ap-\npearance features or color styles of neural implicit fields, or making\nminor geometry adjustments but do not offer extensive support for\nnon-rigid deformation or topology modification.\nA more desirable approach to editing the neural implicit field is\nto make it as user-friendly as manipulating an explicit mesh in tradi-\ntional graphics workflows, ensuring compatibility with popular 3D\nsoftware like Maya, Blender, and more. Unlike a 3D mesh, the neural\nimplicit field lacks an explicit shape for artists to manipulate directly,\nbut it offers the capability of achieving photo-realistic rendering\nwith high-fidelity scene details, a significant difference from the ren-\ndering of user-edited 3D meshes. Rendering 3D-edited meshes faces\nchallenges in managing multiple aspects simultaneously, including background, like the Gundam in Fig. 1 and the sculpture in\nFig. 16.\nMoreover, our approach advances both the fine-grained editing methods.\nWhile our approach excels in managing intricate geometric and\ncolor details, it does have limitations. Firstly, our method lacks di-\nrect support for editing scene shading and lighting. Users mustinstead bake these features into the vertex colors. This limitation\nmay restrict real-time user control over these aesthetic aspects. Ad-\nditionally, our method faces challenges when editing highly intricate\nstructures that cannot produce a high-quality surface mesh, such as\nhuman hair. In such scenarios, due to the lack of a reliable under-\nlying structure, our method may struggle to edit the specific part,111:12 \u2022Can Wang, Mingming He, Menglei Chai, Dongdong Chen, and Jing Liao\nSource Mesh User Edits Source Rendered RELATED WORK\n2.1 Neural Implicit Fields Editing\nNeural implicit fields are a potent representation for modeling com-\nplex 3D scenes and enabling free-view photo-realistic rendering,\nspurring extensive research in high-quality 3D reconstruction [Chen\net al.2022b,a; Jain et al .2021; M\u00fcller et al .2022; Yu et al .2021; Zhang\net al.2022], and 3D asset generation [Jain et al .2022; Niemeyer and\nGeiger 2021; Park et al .2021a,b; Poole et al .2022; Schwarz et al .\n2020]. However, these existing neural implicit models offer limited\nuser control", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nCreating high-quality 3D humans from user condition is of great importance to a wide variety of applications, ranging from virtual try-on\u00a0[78, 69, 70, 29] to immersive telepresence\u00a0[39, 67, 98, 42, 27, 28]. To this end, researchers explore the task of text-driven 3D human generation, which synthesizes the character\u2019s appearance and geometry based on text prompts. Traditional methods resort to a hand-crafted pipeline, where 3D models are first regressed from multi-view human captures, and then undergo a series of manual processes like rigging and skinning\u00a0[3, 26, 38, 35]. To ease human labor for 3D asset creation of diverse layouts, the exemplar work DreamFusion\u00a0[59] proposes score distillation sampling (SDS) to harness rich 2D text-to-image prior (e.g., Stable Diffusion\u00a0[65], Imagen\u00a0[66]) by optimizing 3D scenes to render samples that reside on the manifold of higher likelihood. Though accomplishing reasonable results on single objects\u00a0[64, 50, 83, 6], it is hard for them to model detailed human bodies with complex articulations.\n\n\nTo incorporate structural guidance, recent text-driven 3D human studies combine SDS with body shape models such as SMPL\u00a0[46] and imGHUM\u00a0[1]. In particular, a common paradigm is to integrate human priors into representations like mesh and neural radiance field (NeRF), either by taking the body shape as mesh/density initialization\u00a0[20, 93, 36], or by learning a deformation field based on linear blend skinning (LBS)\u00a0[4, 85, 92]. However, they mostly compromise to trade-off between efficiency and quality: the mesh-based methods\u00a0[41, 25, 90] struggle to model fine topologies like accessories and wrinkles; while the NeRF-based methods\u00a0[22, 94, 23] are time/memory-consuming to render high-resolution results. How to achieve fine-grained generation efficiently remains an unsolved problem.\n\n\nRecently, the explicit neural representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\u00a0[33] provides a new perspective for real-time scene reconstruction. It enables multi-scale modeling across multiple granularities, which is suitable for 3D human generation. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to exploit such representation in this task with two challenges:\n1) 3DGS characterizes a tile-based rasterization by sorting and \u03b1\ud835\udefc\\alphaitalic_\u03b1-blending anisotropic splats within each view frustum, which only back-propagates a small set of high-confidence Gaussians. However, as verified in the 3D surface-/volume-rendering studies\u00a0[17, 76, 31, 52], sparse gradient could hinder network optimization of geometry and appearance. Therefore, structural guidance is required in 3DGS, especially for the human domain that demands hierarchical structure modeling and generation controllability.\n2) The naive SDS necessitates a large classifier-free guidance (CFG)\u00a0[18] scale for image-text alignment (e.g., 100100100100 as used in\u00a0[59]). But it sacrifices visual quality with over-saturated patterns, making realistic human generation difficult. Besides, due to the stochasticity of SDS loss, the original gradient-based density control in 3DGS is unstable, which incurs blurry results with floating artifacts.\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our intuition lies in that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. The key is to incorporate explicit structural guidance and gradient regularization to facilitate Gaussian optimization.\nSpecifically, we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that jointly learns human appearance and geometry. Unlike", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\n3D Gaussian Splatting[12] has recently emerged as a highly efficient representation for novel view synthesis. Compared to the time-consuming ray marching used in most neural radiance fields (NeRF)\u00a0[15, 16, 2], a high-resolution image can be rendered in real-time by rasterizing the splatted 3D Gaussians. However, this rasterization algorithm is subjected to severe aliasing effect and speed deterioration when rendering the same scene at low resolution or from distant positions as shown in Fig.\u00a01. This limitation significantly constrain the application of the 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm in reconstructing and rendering large-scale scenes.\n\n\nAliasing effect is a consequence of inadequate sampling frequency failing to capture the continuous signal accurately. In the context of rendering, image pixels are sampled with an interval of one-pixel size. The signal can be considered as the 3D scene represented implicitly as in NeRF or explicitly as in 3D Gaussians. When part of the 3D scene is represented with high details but rendered with low resolution or from distant positions, the disparity between the low sampling and high signal frequencies culminates in aliasing artifacts. A naive solution is to render at high resolution and subsequently down-scale the rendered image to a lower resolution. However, this solution is not viable for scenes containing both near and far regions which are very common.\nDue to the inability of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm to accommodate varying resolutions within a single image, rendering the entire image with a even higher resolution for the sake of far away regions is neither time nor memory efficient.\n\n\nWe postulate that the pronounced aliasing artifacts observed when rendering with 3D Gaussians, as opposed to other techniques such as NeRF, are primarily attributable to the splatting of small Gaussians. 3D regions with intricate details are represented with large amount of small Gaussians. When rendering these regions with low resolution or from a distant view, many splatted small Gaussians are cramped in one pixel and therefore the pixel color of this region is dominated by the front-most Gaussian, even if this Gaussian is much smaller than others and not at the center. This problem is further aggravated by the low pass filter in [12, 19] applied to each individual Gaussian with the intention to mitigate aliasing on edges at high resolutions. This problem is explained in more detail in\u00a0Sec.\u00a03.2.\n\n\nIn addition to the aliasing artifacts, the rendering speed of 3D Gaussians is also affected at low resolution. The number of 3D Gaussians that need to be rendered remains constant at lower resolutions, but they are more concentrated to fewer pixels. The Gaussians that are splatted to the same pixel cannot be rendered in parallel.\nThis means that the image rendering is even slower at lower resolution in comparison with NeRF rendering time that reduces linearly with decreasing resolution.\nHence, although aliasing is not a problem exclusive to 3D Gaussian splatting, it is more prominent and more difficult to tackle.\n\n\nContributions\n\nTo mitigate the aliasing problem for 3D Gaussian splatting, we propose a novel multi-scale 3D Gaussians to represent the scene at different levels of detail (LOD) as shown in Fig.\u00a02. This is inspired by the mipmap", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDriven by advances in generative image modeling with diffusion models\u00a0[38, 68, 76, 71], there has been significant recent progress on generative video models both in research\u00a0[42, 82, 95, 9] and real-world applications\u00a0[74, 54]\nBroadly, these models are either trained from scratch\u00a0[41] or finetuned (partially or fully) from pretrained image models with additional temporal layers inserted\u00a0[9, 32, 43, 82]. Training is often carried out on a mix of image and video datasets\u00a0[41].\n\n\nWhile research around improvements in video modeling has primarily focused on the exact arrangement of the spatial and temporal layers\u00a0[43, 82, 41, 9], none of the aforementioned works investigate the influence of data selection. This is surprising, especially since the significant impact of the training data distribution on generative models is undisputed\u00a0[13, 105]. Moreover, for generative image modeling, it is known that pretraining on a large and diverse dataset\nand finetuning on a smaller but higher quality dataset significantly improves the performance\u00a0[71, 13]. Since many previous approaches to video modeling have successfully drawn on techniques from the image domain\u00a0[9, 42, 43], it is noteworthy that the effect of data and training strategies, i.e., the separation of video pretraining at lower resolutions and high-quality finetuning, has yet to be studied.\nThis work directly addresses these previously uncharted territories.\n\n\nWe believe that the significant contribution of data selection is heavily underrepresented in today\u2019s video research landscape despite being well-recognized among practitioners when training video models at scale. Thus, in contrast to previous works, we draw on simple latent video diffusion baselines\u00a0[9] for which we fix architecture and training scheme and assess the effect of data curation.\nTo this end, we first identify three different video training stages that we find crucial for good performance: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining on a large dataset at low resolution, and high-resolution video finetuning on a much smaller dataset with higher-quality videos. Borrowing from large-scale image model training\u00a0[66, 64, 13], we\nintroduce a systematic approach to curate video data at scale and present an empirical study on the effect of data curation during video pretraining. Our main findings imply that pretraining on well-curated datasets leads to significant performance improvements that persist after high-quality finetuning.\n\n\nA general motion and multi-view prior\n\nDrawing on these findings, we apply our proposed curation scheme to a large video dataset comprising roughly 600 million samples and train a strong pretrained text-to-video base model, which provides a general motion representation.\nWe exploit this and finetune the base model on a smaller, high-quality dataset for high-resolution downstream tasks such as text-to-video (see Figure\u00a01, top row) and image-to-video, where we predict a sequence of frames from a single conditioning image (see Figure\u00a01, mid rows). Human preference studies reveal that the resulting model outperforms state-of-the-art image-to-video models.\n\n\nFurthermore, we also demonstrate that our model provides a strong multi-view prior and can serve as a base to finetune a multi-view diffusion model that generates multiple consistent views of an object in a feedforward manner and outperforms specialized novel view synthesis methods such as Zero123XL\u00a0[57, 14] and SyncDreamer\u00a0[58]. Finally, we demonstrate that our model allows for explicit motion control by specifically prompting the temporal layers with motion cues", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn the evolving field of computer vision, the development of user-friendly 3D representations and editing algorithms is a key objective. Such technologies are vital in various applications, ranging from digital gaming to the growing MetaVerse. Traditional 3D representations like meshes and point clouds have been preferred due to their interactive editing capabilities. However, these methods face challenges in accurately rendering complex 3D scenes.\n\n\nThe recent rise of implicit 3D representations, exemplified by the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)\u00a0[28], represents a paradigm shift in 3D scene rendering. NeRF\u2019s capacity for high-fidelity rendering, coupled with its implicit nature that offers significant expansibility, marks a substantial improvement over conventional approaches[2, 55, 32]. This dual advantage has placed a significant focus on the NeRF framework in 3D editing\u00a0[45, 46, 12, 57, 31], establishing it as a foundational approach for a considerable duration.\nHowever, NeRF\u2019s reliance on high-dimensional multilayer perception (MLP) networks for scene data encoding presents limitations. It restricts direct modification of specific scene parts and complicates tasks, like inpainting and scene composition. This complexity extends to the training and rendering processes, hindering practical applications.\n\n\nIn light of these challenges, our research is focused on developing an advanced 3D editing algorithm. This algorithm aims for flexible and rapid editing of 3D scenes, integrating both implicit editing, like text-based editing, and explicit control, such as bounding box usage for specific area modifications.\nTo achieve these goals, we choose Gaussian Splatting (GS)\u00a0[15] for its real-time rendering and explicit point cloud-like representations.\n\n\nHowever, editing Gaussian Splatting (GS)\u00a0[15] faces distinct challenges. A primary issue is the absence of efficient methods to accurately identify target Gaussians, which is crucial for precise controllable editing. Moreover, it has been observed in\u00a0[7, 44, 52] that optimizing Gaussian Splatting (GS) using highly random generative guidance like Score Distillation Sampling\u00a0[36] poses significant challenges. One possible explanation is that, unlike implicit representations buffered by neural networks, GS is directly affected by the randomness in loss. Such direct exposure results in unstable updates, as the properties of Gaussians are directly changed during training. Besides, each training step of GS may involve updates to a vast number of Gaussian points. This process occurs without the moderating influence of neural network-style buffering mechanisms. As a result, the excessive fluidity of the 3D GS scene hinders its ability to converge to finely detailed results like implicit representations when trained with generative guidance.\n\n\nTo counter these issues, in this work, we propose GaussianEditor\u00a0, a novel, swift, and highly controllable 3D editing algorithm for Gaussian Splatting. GaussianEditor\u00a0can fulfill various high-quality editing needs within minutes. A key feature of our method is the introduction of Gaussian semantic tracing, which enables precise control over Gaussian Splatting (GS). Gaussian semantic tracing consistently identifies the Gaussians requiring editing at every moment during training. This contrasts with traditional 3D editing methods that often depend on static 2D or 3D masks. Such masks become less effective as the geometries and appearances of 3D models evolve during training. Gaussian semantic tracing is achieved by unprojecting 2D segmentation masks into 3D Gaussians and assigning each Gaussian a semantic tag. As the Gaussians evolve during training, these", " INTRODUCTION\n3D content creation is important for many applications, such as interactive gaming, cinematic arts,\nAR/VR, and simulation. However, it is still challenging and expensive to create a high-quality 3D\nasset as it requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, automating this process with generative\nmodels has become an important problem, which remains challenging due to the scarcity of data\nand the complexity of 3D representations.\nRecently, techniques based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) (Poole et al., 2022; Lin et al.,\n2023; Chen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b), also known as Score Jacobian Chaining (SJC) (Wang\net al., 2023a), have emerged as a major research direction for text-to-3D generation, as they can\nproduce high-quality and intricate 3D experiments, we find that CSD combined\nwith general negative prompts can achieve high-quality texture quality comparable to VSD.\n5 E XPERIMENTS\nWe evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Classifier Score Distillation method across three tasks:\ntext-guided 3D generation, text-guided texture synthesis, and text-guided 3D editing.

This ability requires extensive\nknowledge of the 3D world.\nRecently, the field of 3D generation has experienced\nrapid and flourishing development with the introduction of\ndiffusion models. A growing body of research [5, 29, 43,\n59, 63], such as DreamField [24], DreamFusion [43], and\nMagic3D [29], resort to distilling prior knowledge of 2D\nimage diffusion models or vision language models to create\n3D models from text or images via Score Distillation Sam-\npling (SDS) [43].

To overcome these difficulties men-\ntioned above, we design a cross-domain diffusion scheme\nvia a domain switcher , denoted as s. The switcher sis a\none-dimensional vector that labels different domains, and\nwe further feed the switcher into the diffusion model as an\nextra input. Therefore, the formulation of Eq. 2 can be ex-\ntended as:\nn1:K, x1:K=f(y,\u03c01:K, sn), f(y,\u03c01:K, sc).

Then we render\nnormal maps and color images from six views, including\nthe front, back, left, right, front-right, and front-left views,\nusing Blenderproc [11]. Additionally, to enhance dataset di-\nversity, we applied random rotations to the 3D assets during\nthe rendering process.We fine-tune our model starting from the Stable Diffu-\nsion Image Variations Model, which has previously been\nfine-tuned with image conditions. We retain the optimizer\nsettings and \u03f5-prediction strategy from the previous fine-\ntuning. During fine-tuning, we use a reduced image size\nof 256 \u00d7256 and a total batch size of 512 for training. The\nfine-tuning process involves training the model for 30,000\nsteps.

Given a few images of the same\nsubject, DreamBooth embeds the subject into a T2I diffusion model\nby binding it to a unique identifier (denoted as \u2217).

Our goal is to change\nthe shape and appearance of the object of interest in the original\n3D scene according to the text prompt. Fig. 3 gives an example\nof turning a horse sculpture into a real giraffe. This", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 2: Concept figure of LENeRF. Our method enables local editing of 3D assets by generating the target feature and estimating a 3D mask which guides the model on where to make changes at the feature level. Note that the mask is estimated for tri-plane features, not for raw RGB outputs.\n\n\n3D content editing has many real-world applications including but not limited to product design, cartoon generation, and 3D Avatar editing. However, it often necessitates the use of sophisticated tools with complex interfaces, which can be difficult for novice users and labor-intensive even for seasoned professionals.\nWhile explicit 3D representations such as voxels and meshes are commonly used for 3D generation and editing\u00a0[17, 31, 54], they are memory-intensive and lack photorealism. In contrast, recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)\u00a0[33] have shown promising progress in representing 3D environments using implicit representations\u00a0[14, 21, 37, 33] combined with volume rendering techniques that enable high-quality novel view synthesis. NeRF-based 3D GANs\u00a0[43, 36, 5, 11, 50, 52, 16, 4] have made further progress towards generating a category of 3D aware contents with a single model, extending the per-scene optimization scheme of NeRF.\n\n\nSeveral studies\u00a0[29, 48, 45, 44] have attempted to address the challenges of NeRF editing, yet certain limitations persist.\nWorks such as Edit-NeRF\u00a0[29] and CLIP-NeRF\u00a0[48] have pioneered NeRF manipulations, but they are constrained to low-resolution synthetic datasets and lack the capability to perform localized editing.\nOpposed to translation\u00a0[9, 53] or style transfer\u00a0[13] tasks, editing typically demands a certain degree of localization.\nHowever, achieving this with text-only control proves to be a challenging objective.\nAlternative methods\u00a0[45, 44] that rely on semantic masks for editing face their own limitations: 2D guidance is not ideal for 3D editing and lacks the descriptiveness required for fine-grained editing. Furthermore, these approaches require inversion steps and are difficult to generalize across different domains, as they depend on the availability of labeled semantic masks.\n\n\nTo overcome the existing limitations, we propose Local Editing NeRF (LENeRF), which focuses on the important aspects of 3D editing: photorealism, multi-view consistency, usability, diversity, and locality. With LENeRF, high-resolution photo-realistic radiance fields can be edited while maintaining their quality and multi-view consistency.\nOne notable advantage of LENeRF is its text-only editing, making it more usable than other methods. This allows our approach to be applied to any domain by leveraging the multi-modal embedding space of Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP)\u00a0[39]. Additionally, our method achieves real-time editing as it does not require any test-time optimization process.\n\n\nOur proposed approach exhibits particularly robust performance in local 3D editing.\nThis is achieved through a unique method of editing features in the 3D space independently by granting position-wise freedom to the features.\nThe naive approach of directly manipulating the latent code often results in global changes to the 3D content, because features in the 3D space are spatially entangled with each other as the entire radiance field is conditioned with a single latent code.\nTo address this issue, we propose to generate a 3D mask on the region of interest with a masking prompt (e.g., \u201dhair\u201d) and manipulate the features inside the region while leaving the rest unchanged.\nInspired by the previous approach", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Examples of multiple views of 3D objects generated by from our model given text prompts (below each object).\n\n\n\nThe task of automatic text-to-3D generation aims to create 3D assets based on a text description and has gained significant attention due to its wide-ranging applications in digital content generation, film-making, and Virtual Reality (VR)\u00a0(Lin et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023b).\nInitial efforts in this domain centered on unconditional 3D asset generation, experimenting with various 3D representation modalities presented in explicit formats such as meshes\u00a0(Achlioptas et\u00a0al., 2018; Luo & Hu, 2021; Smith & Meger, 2017; Xie et\u00a0al., 2018), as well as implicit formats such as fields\u00a0(Chen & Zhang, 2019; Mittal et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhuang et\u00a0al., 2023).\nFollowing this, the field has progressed towards conditional 3D generative models, e.g., with text-based guidance\u00a0(Cheng et\u00a0al., 2023). However, these studies have been limited to relatively simple 3D assets, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated 3D datasets.\n\n\nThe availability of ample image datasets and the success of text-to-image generation have paved the way for lifting pre-trained text-to-image models to the 3D domain. Specifically, recent studies focus on optimizing a 3D representation for an asset, using pre-trained text-to-image generative models by providing a denoising score for rendered images\u00a0(Khalid et\u00a0al., 2022; Jain et\u00a0al., 2022; Poole et\u00a0al., 2022; Xu et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023a; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023b).\nPoole et\u00a0al. (2022) proposed a loss from the distillation of a text-to-image diffusion model. They minimized\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a family of Gaussian distributions based on the forward diffusion process and the denoising scores acquired from the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The proposed Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method combined with a NeRF enables 3D asset generation from given text prompts.\nSubsequent research has improved generation quality through various approaches including the adoption of two-stage optimization frameworks\u00a0(Lin et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023b; Chen et\u00a0al., 2023c), alterations to the original SDS formulation\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2023a; b), and the disentanglement of geometry and appearance\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2023b).\n\n\nIn this work, we revisit the integration of the SDS approach with NeRFs, aiming to achieve photo-realistic and high-quality text-to-3D generation through a single-stage optimization.\nIn contrast to existing text-to-3D generation work, we distill the score in the text-to-image diffusion model\u2019s latent and image spaces for enhanced supervision. Moreover, we observe that the efficacy of the diffusion prior is limited in previous works\u00a0(Poole et\u00a0al., 2022; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023) when timesteps (also referred to as noise levels in denoising score matching) are randomly sampled during optimization. Specifically, we observe that toward the end of the training process, the NeRF becomes almost determined in representing a particular 3D asset. Thus, we find that randomly sampling a large timestep drives the diffusion model to produce a denoised image that is distinct and unrelated to the original input rendering. This yields inconsistent distillation from the diffusion model and compromised optimization of NeRFs. To address this, we introduce a timestep annealing approach where the timestep in the forward diffusion process inversely correlates with the square root of the number of training iterations. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed", " Introduction\n3D content and technologies enable us to visualize, comprehend, and interact with complex objects\nand environments that are reflective of our real-life experiences. Their pivotal role extends across a\nwide array of domains, encompassing architecture, animation, gaming, and the rapidly evolving fields\nof virtual and augmented reality. In spite of the extensive applications, the production of premium 3D\ncontent often remains a formidable task. It necessitates a significant investment of time and effort,\neven when undertaken by professional designers. This challenge has prompted the development of\ntext-to-3D methods, and\nwe use the same setting of CFG (e.g. 7.5) as the common text-to-image generation task for the best\nperformance. To the best of our knowledge, this for the first time addresses the problem in previous\nSDS [ 34,20,4,29] that it usually requires a large CFG (i.e., 100). Specifically, SDS (Eq. (3)) uses\n(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5)while VSD (Eq. (9))) uses (\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y )). For example,\nfor the 2D special case of g(\u03b8, c)\u2261\u03b8, we have \u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)]and\n\u2207\u03b8LVSD(\u03b8) =Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)(\u03f5pretrain (xt, t, yc)\u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y ))]. Intuitively, to obtain highly detailed\nsamples, the updating direction for \u03b8needs to be \u201cfine\u201d and \u201csharp\u201d. As SDS only depends on \u03f5pretrain ,\nit needs a large CFG ( = 100 ) to make sure \u03f5pretrain to be \u201csharp\u201d enough; however, large CFG, in turn,\nreduces the diversity of the results of ProlificDreamer compared with baselines.\n36 Background\nWe present preliminaries on diffusion models, score distillation sampling, and 3D representations.\nDiffusion models.

As shown in Table 6, the FID by VSD is much better than SDS. As\nthe 2D setting isolates the sampling algorithm from the 3D representations, we can directly compare\ndifferent sampling algorithms, finding that VSD can get better sample quality than SDS (though still\nworse than SOTA diffusion samplers, it can generalize to 3D cases).\nL Why using SDS in stage-2 for the geometry optimization of mesh?\nVSD can also be used to generate geometry. To validate this, we provide an ablation example in\nFig. 21 (3a),(3b). As shown in the figure, VSD can obtain reasonable geometry. Although the some\npart of the geometry from VSD is with more details than SDS (including the tail of the horse), on\nthe whole, the result from VSD is similar with SDS.

The Results\nWe", " Introduction\nWith the emergence of efficient neural 3D reconstruc-\ntion techniques, capturing a realistic digital representation\nof a real-world 3D scene has never been easier. The pro-\ncess is simple: capture a collection of images of a scenefrom varying viewpoints, reconstruct their camera param-\neters, and use the posed images to optimize a Neural Ra-\ndiance Field [26]. Due to its ease of use, we expect cap-\ntured 3D content to gradually replace the traditional pro-\ncesses of manually-generated assets. Unfortunately, while\nthe pipelines for turning a real scene into a 3D representa-\ntion are relatively mature and accessible, many of the other\nnecessary tools for the creation of 3D assets (e.g., those\nneeded for editing 3D scenes) remain underdeveloped.\nTraditional processes for editing 3D models involve spe-\ncialized tools and years of training in order to manually\nsculpt, extrude, and re-texture a given object. This pro-\ncess is made even more involved with the advent of neural\nrepresentations, which often do not have explicit surfaces.\nThis further motivates the need for 3D editing approaches\ndesigned for the modern era of 3D representations, particu-\nlarly approaches that are similarly as accessible as the cap-\nture techniques themselves.\nTo this end, we propose Instruct-NeRF2NeRF, a method\nfor editing 3D NeRF scenes that requires as input only a\n1arXiv:2303.12789v2  [cs.CV]  1 Jun 2023InstructPix2Pix\nOriginal Dataset Image\nText Prompt\nCurrent NeRF Render Noise\u201cTurn the bear into a grizzly bear\u201dConditioning\nSignalDataset Update\nFigure 2: Overview : Our method gradually updates a reconstructed NeRF scene by iteratively updating the dataset images while training\nthe NeRF: (1) an image is rendered from the scene at a training viewpoint, (2) it is edited by InstructPix2Pix given a global text instruction,\n(3) the training dataset image is replaced with the edited image, and (4) the NeRF continues training as usual.\ntext instruction. Our approach operates on a pre-captured\n3D scene and ensures that the resulting edits are reflected\nin a 3D-consistent manner. For example, given a 3D scene\ncapture of a person shown in Figure 1 (left), we can enable\na wide variety of edits using flexible and expressive textual\ninstruction such as \u201cGive him a cowboy hat\u201d or\u201cTurn\nhim into Albert Einstein\u201d . Our approach makes 3D scene\nediting accessible and intuitive for everyday users.\nThough there exist 3D generative models, the data-\nsources required for training these models at scale are still\nlimited. Therefore, we instead choose to extract shape and\nappearance priors from a 2D diffusion model. Specifically,\nwe employ a recent image-conditioned diffusion model,\nInstructPix2Pix [2], which enables instruction-based 2D\nimage editing. Unfortunately, applying this model on\nindividual images rendered from a reconstructed NeRF\nproduces inconsistent edits across viewpoints. As a solution\nto this, we devise a simple approach similar to recent 3D\ngeneration solutions like DreamFusion [33]. Our underly-\ning method, which we refer to as Iterative Dataset Update\n(Iterative DU), alternates between editing the \u201cdataset\u201d\nof NeRF input images, and updating the underlying 3D\nrepresentation to incorporate the edited images.\nWe evaluate our approach on a variety of captured NeRF\nscenes, validating our design choices by comparing with ab-\nlated variants of our method, as well as na \u00a8\u0131ve implementa-\ntions of the score distillation sampling (SDS) loss proposed\nin DreamFusion [33]. We also qualitatively compare our ap-\nproach to a concurrent text-based stylization approach [47].\nWe demonstrate that our method can accomplish a wide va-\nriety of edits on people, objects, and", " Introduction\nArt is a reflection of the figments of human imagination.\nWhile many are limited in their practical creative capabili-\nties, by pushing the boundaries of digital media, new ways\ncan be created for casual artists and experts alike to express\ntheir ideas. At the same time, current neural generative art\ntakes away much of the control from humans. In this work,\nwe attempt to take a step towards restoring some of that\ncontrol, enabling neural networks to complement users and\nnaturally extend their skills rather than taking hold over the\ngenerative process.\nThe field of image synthesis has been significantly pro-\npelled by neural generative models, particularly by the lat-\nest text-to-image models that predominantly rely on large\nlanguage-image models [3, 54, 55, 56].

In this paper, we aim to develop a strong system to detect arbitrary objects specified by human language inputs, a task commonly referred to as open-set object detection222We view the terms open-set object detection, open-world object detection, and open-vocabulary object detection the same task in this paper. To avoid confusion, we always use open-set object detection in our paper.. The task has wide applications for its great potential as a generic object detector. For example, we can cooperate with generative models for image editing (as shown in Fig. 1 (b)).\n\n\nIn pursuit of this goal, we design the strong open-set object detector Grounding DINO by following the two principles: tight modality fusion based on DINO\u00a0[57] and large-scale grounded pre-train for concept generalization.\n\n\nTight modality fusion based on DINO.\nThe key to open-set detection is introducing language for unseen object generalization [25, 1, 7]. Most existing open-set detectors are developed by extending closed-set detectors to open-set scenarios with language information. As shown in Fig. 2, a closed-set detector typically has three important modules, a backbone for feature extraction, a neck for feature enhancement, and a head for region refinement (or box prediction). A closed-set detector can be generalized to detect novel objects by learning language-aware region embeddings so that each region can be classified into novel categories in a language-aware semantic space. The key to achieving this goal is using contrastive loss between region outputs and language features at the neck and/or head outputs.\n\n\nFigure 2: Extending closed-set detectors to open-set scenarios. \n\n\nTo help a model align cross-modality information\nsome work tried to fuse features before the final loss stage.\nWe summarize the modulized design of object detectors in Fig. 2.\nFeature fusion can be performed in three phases: neck (phase A), query initialization (phase B), and head (phase C). For example, GLIP [25] performs early fusion in the neck module (phase A), and OV-DETR [55] uses language-aware queries as head inputs (phase B).\nWe argue that introducing more feature fusion into the pipeline can facilitate better alignment between different modality features, thereby achieving better performance.\n\n\nAlthough conceptually simple, it is hard for previous work to perform feature fusion in all three phases. The design of classical detectors like Faster RCNN makes it hard to interact with language information in most blocks. Unlike classical detectors, the Transformer-based detector method such as DINO has a consistent structure with language blocks. The layer-by-layer design enables it to interact with language information easily.\nUnder this principle, we design three feature fusion approaches in the neck, query initialization, and head phases. More specifically, we design a feature enhancer by stacking self-attention, text-to-image cross-attention, and image-to-text cross-attention as the neck module. We then develop a language-guided query selection method to initialize queries for the detection head. We also design a cross-modality decoder for the head phase with image and text cross-attention layers to boost query representations.\n\n\nLarge-scale grounded pre-train for zero-shot transfer.\nMost existing open-set models [21, 14] rely on pre-trained CLIP models for concept generalization.\nNevertheless, the efficacy of CLIP,", " INTRODUCTION\nArtistic works depict the world in various creative and imaginative\nstyles, evolving along with human progress. While primarily driven\nby professionals, the generation of artistic content is now more\naccessible to average users than ever before, empowered by the\nrecent research on visual artistic stylization.

Since\ntraining data for this task is dif\ufb01cult to acquire at scale,\nwe propose an approach for generating a paired dataset\nthat combines multiple large models pretrained on different\nmodalities: a large language model (GPT-3 [7]) and a text-\nto-image model (Stable Diffusion [52]). These two models\ncapture complementary knowledge about language and im-\nages that can be combined to create paired training data for\na task spanning both modalities.\nUsing our generated paired data, we train a conditional\ndiffusion model that, given an input image and a text in-\nstruction for how to edit it, generates the edited image. Our\nmodel directly performs the image edit in the forward pass,\nand does not require any additional example images, full de-\nscriptions of the input/output images, or per-example \ufb01ne-\ntuning. Despite being trained entirely on synthetic exam-\nples (i.e., both generated written instructions and generated\n1arXiv:2211.09800v2  [cs.CV]  18 Jan 2023imagery), our model achieves zero-shot generalization to\nboth arbitrary real images and natural human-written in-\nstructions. Our model enables intuitive image editing that\ncan follow human instructions to perform a diverse collec-\ntion of edits: replacing objects, changing the style of an im-\nage, changing the setting, the artistic medium, among oth-\ners. Selected examples can be found in Figure 1.\n2. Prior work\nComposing large pretrained models Recent work has\nshown that large pretrained models can be combined to\nsolve multimodal tasks that no one model can perform\nalone, such as image captioning and visual question an-\nswering (tasks that require the knowledge of both a large\nlanguage model and a text-image model). Techniques for\ncombining pretrained models include joint \ufb01netuning on a\nnew task [4, 34, 41, 68], communication through prompt-\ning [63, 70], composing probability distributions of energy-\nbased models [11, 38], guiding one model with feedback\nfrom another [62], and iterative optimization [35]. Our\nmethod is similar to prior work in that it leverages the com-\nplementary abilities of two pretrained models\u2014GPT-3 [7])\nand Stable Diffusion [52]\u2014but differs in that we use these\nmodels to generate paired multi-modal training data.\nDiffusion-based generative models Recent advances in\ndiffusion models [60] have enabled state-of-the-art image\nsynthesis [10, 18, 19, 54, 56, 61] as well as generative mod-\nels of other modalities such as video [21, 59], audio [31],\ntext [36] and network parameters [46]. Recent text-to-\nimage diffusion models [42, 49, 52, 55] have shown to gen-\nerate realistic images from arbitrary text captions.\nGenerative models for image editing Image editing\nmodels traditionally targeted a single editing task such as\nstyle transfer [15, 16] or translation between image do-\nmains [22, 24, 37, 43, 72].

We then\n\ufb01ne-tune the generative model to better reconstruct the in-\nput image and \ufb01nally manipulate the latent representation\nto obtain the edit result.Increasing \u03b7\nInput ImageEdited ImageTarget Text: \u201cA blue car\u201d\nTarget Text: \u201cA bar stool\u201d\nFigure 5.

NeRF encodes the vol-\numetric density and color of a scene within the weights of\na coordinate-based multi-layer perceptron. Several follow-\nup works extend original NeRF to handle different tasks,\nsuch as pose estimation [18, 38], 3D-aware image synthe-\nsis [4, 25, 32], deformable 3D reconstruction [20, 26, 29],\nand modeling dynamic scenes [10, 12, 39].\nThough NeRF achieves great performance on photo-\nrealistic scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis,\nthere remain enormous challenges in editing the geome-\ntries and appearances of a scene represented by a pre-trained\nNeRF model. Unlike traditional image editing, a user needs\nto transfer his/her edits on a rendered view to the NeRF\nmodel to edit the whole scene, thus introducing multiple\nchallenges. First, it is unclear where the edited regions ap-\npear on other rendered views. Second, because millions of\nparameters are used in a pre-trained NeRF model, it is un-\nclear which parameters control the different aspects of the\nrendered shape and how to change the parameters according\nto the sparse local user input.

Novel view synthesis\nConstructing novel views of a scene captured by multi-\nple images is a", " Introduction\nImage synthesis is one of the computer vision \ufb01elds with\nthe most spectacular recent development, but also among\nthose with the greatest computational demands. Espe-\ncially high-resolution synthesis of complex, natural scenes\nis presently dominated by scaling up likelihood-based mod-\nels, potentially containing billions of parameters in autore-\ngressive (AR) transformers [66,67]. In contrast, the promis-\ning Related Work\nGenerative Models for Image Synthesis The high di-\nmensional nature of images presents distinct challenges\nto generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) [27] allow for ef\ufb01cient sampling of high resolution\nimages with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are dif\ufb01-\n2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full\ndata distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth-\nods emphasize good density estimation which renders op-\ntimization more well-behaved. Variational autoencoders\n(V AE) [46] and \ufb02ow-based models [18, 19] enable ef\ufb01cient\nsynthesis of high resolution images [9, 44, 92], but sam-\nple quality is not on par with GANs. While autoregressive\nmodels (ARM) [6, 10, 94, 95] achieve strong performance\nin density estimation, computationally demanding architec-\ntures [97] and a sequential sampling process limit them to\nlow resolution images. Because pixel based representations\nof images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency de-\ntails [16,73], maximum-likelihood training spends a dispro-\nportionate amount of capacity on modeling them, resulting\nin long training times. To scale to higher resolutions, several\ntwo-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model\na compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels.\nRecently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82],\nhave achieved state-of-the-art methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(zjx) =\nN(z;E\u0016;E\u001b2)and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0;1)as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu-\nlarizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of jZjdifferent exemplars [96].\nTo obtain high-\ufb01delity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the\nKLterm by a factor\u001810\u00006or choose a high codebook dimensionality jZj.\nThe full objective to train the autoencoding model (E;D)reads:\nLAutoencoder = min\nE;Dmax\n \u0010\nLrec(x;D(E(x)))\u0000Ladv(D(E(x))) + logD (x) +Lreg(x;E;D)\u0011\n(25)\nDM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two\ncases when learning p(z)orp(zjy)(Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we sample z=E\u0016(x)+E\u001b(x)\u0001\"=:E(x),\nwhere\"\u0018N(0;1).

In the deep learning era, many\nIQA approaches [12, 34, 36, 43, 49] have achieved signi\ufb01-\ncant success by leveraging the power of convolutional neu-\nral networks (CNNs). However, the CNN-based IQA mod-\nels are often constrained by the \ufb01xed-size input requirement\nin batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized\nor cropped to a \ufb01xed shape as shown in Figure 1 (b). This\npreprocessing is problematic for IQA because images in the\nwild have varying aspect ratios and resolutions. Resizing\nand cropping can impact image composition or introduce\ndistortions, thus changing the quality of the image.\nTo learn IQA on the full-size image, the existing CNN-\nbased approaches use either adaptive pooling or resizing to\nget a \ufb01xed-size convolutional feature map. MNA-CNN [25]\n1Checkpoints and code are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/google-research/tree/master/musiq\nFigure 1. In CNN-based models (b), images need to be resized or\ncropped to a \ufb01xed shape for batch training. However, such prepro-\ncessing can alter image aspect ratio and composition, thus impact-\ning image quality. Our patch-based MUSIQ model (a) can process\nthe full-size image and extract multi-scale features, which aligns\nwith the human visual system.\nprocesses a single image in each training batch which is not\npractical for training on a large dataset. Hosu et al. [16]\nextracts and stores \ufb01xed-size features of\ufb02ine, which costs\nadditional storage for every augmented image. To keep as-\npect ratio, Chen et al. [7] proposes a dedicated convolu-\ntion to preserve aspect ratio in the convolutional receptive\n\ufb01eld. Its evaluation veri\ufb01es the importance of aspect-ratio-\npreserving (ARP) in the IQA tasks. But it still needs resiz-\ning and smart grouping for effective batch training.\nIn this paper, we propose a patch-based multi-scale im-\nage quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to bypass the CNN con-\nstraints on \ufb01xed input size and predict the quality effectively\non the native resolution image as shown in Figure 1 (a).\nTransformer [38] is \ufb01rst proposed for natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) and has recently been studied for various vi-\nsion tasks [4\u20136, 11]. Among these, the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) [11] splits each image into a sequence of \ufb01xed-size\npatches, encodes each patch as a token, and then appliesarXiv:2108.05997v1  [cs.CV]  12 Aug 2021Transformer to the sequence for image classi\ufb01cation. In\ntheory, such kind of patch-based Transformer models can\nhandle arbitrary numbers of patches (up to memory con-\nstraints), and therefore do not require preprocessing the in-\nput image to a \ufb01xed resolution. This motivates us to apply\nthe patch-based Transformer on the IQA tasks with the full-\nsize images as input.\nAnother aspect for improving IQA models is to imi-\ntate the human visual system which captures an image in\na multi-scale fashion [1]. Previous works [16, 22, 48]\nhave shown the bene\ufb01t of using multi-scale features ex-\ntracted from CNN feature maps at different depths. This\ninspires us to transform the native resolution image into a\nmulti-scale representation, enabling the Transformer\u2019s self-\nattention mechanism to capture information on both \ufb01ne-\ngrained detailed patches and coarse-grained global patches.\nBesides, unlike the convolution operation in CNNs that has\na relatively limited receptive \ufb01eld, self-attention can attend\nto the whole input sequence and it can therefore effectively\ncapture the image quality at different granularities.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to apply the Trans-\nformer on the multi-aspect-ratio multi-scale input.

As we will\ndemonstrate, NeRF\u2019s performance degrades signi\ufb01cantly\nwhen presented with moving objects or variable illumina-\ntion. This limitation prohibits direct application of NeRF to\nlarge-scale in-the-wild scenarios, where input images may\nbe taken hours or years apart, and may contain pedestrians\nand vehicles moving through them.\nThe central limitation of NeRF that we address here is its\nassumption that the world is geometrically, materially, and\nphotometrically static \u2014 that the density and radiance of\nthe world is constant. NeRF therefore requires that any two\nphotographs taken at the same position and orientation must\nbe identical. This assumption is severely violated in many\nreal-world datasets, such as large-scale internet photo collec-\ntions of tourist landmarks. Two photographers may stand in\nthe same location and photograph the same landmark, but\nin the time between those two photographs the world can\nchange signi\ufb01cantly: cars and people may move, construc-\ntion may begin or end, seasons and weather may change,\nthe sun may move through the sky, etc. Even two photos\n1arXiv:2008.02268v3  [cs.CV]  6 Jan 2021taken at the same time and location can exhibit considerable\nvariation: exposure, color correction, and tone-mapping all\nmay vary depending on the camera and post-processing.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

These models predict the next word or token in a sequence based on the previous words as input. Given the discrete nature of languages, the inputs and outputs of these models are in a categorical, discrete-valued space. This prevailing approach has led to a widespread belief that autoregressive models are inherently linked to discrete representations.\n\n\nAs a result, research on generalizing autoregressive models to continuous-valued domains\u2014most notably, image generation\u2014has intensely focused on discretizing the data [6, 13, 40]. A commonly adopted strategy is to train a discrete-valued tokenizer on images, which involves a finite vocabulary obtained by vector quantization (VQ) [51, 41]. Autoregressive models are then operated on the discrete-valued token space, analogous to their language counterparts.\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to address the following question: Is it necessary for autoregressive models to be coupled with vector-quantized representations? We note that the autoregressive nature, i.e., \u201cpredicting next tokens based on previous ones\u201d, is independent of whether the values are discrete or continuous.\nWhat is needed is to model the per-token probability distribution,\nwhich can be measured by a loss function and used to draw samples from.\nDiscrete-valued representations can be conveniently modeled by a categorical distribution, but it is not conceptually necessary.\nIf alternative models for per-token probability distributions are presented, autoregressive models can be approached without vector quantization.\n\n\nWith this observation, we propose to model the per-token probability distribution by a diffusion procedure operating on continuous-valued domains.\nOur methodology leverages the principles of diffusion models [45, 24, 33, 10] for representing arbitrary probability distributions.\nSpecifically, our method autoregressively predicts a vector z\ud835\udc67zitalic_z for each token, which serves as a conditioning for a denoising network (e.g., a small MLP).\nThe denoising diffusion procedure enables us to represent an underlying distribution p\u2062(x|z)\ud835\udc5dconditional\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc67p(x|z)italic_p ( italic_x | italic_z ) for the output x\ud835\udc65xitalic_x (Figure\u00a01). This small denoising network is trained jointly with the autoregressive model, with continuous-valued tokens as the input and target. Conceptually, this small prediction head, applied to each token, behaves like a loss function for measuring the quality of z\ud835\udc67zitalic_z. We refer to this loss function as Diffusion Loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diffusion Loss. Given a continuous-valued token x\ud835\udc65xitalic_x to be predicted, the autoregressive model produces a vector z\ud835\udc67zitalic_z, which serves as the condition of a denoising diffusion network (a small MLP). This offers a way to model the probability distribution p\u2062(x|z)\ud835\udc5dconditional\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc67p(x|z)italic_p ( italic_x | italic_z ) of this token. This network is trained jointly with the autoregressive model by backpropagation. At inference time, with a predicted z\ud835\udc67zitalic_z, running the reverse diffusion procedure can sample a token following the distribution: x\u223cp\u2062(x|z)similar-to\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5dconditional\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc67x\\sim p(x|z)italic_x \u223c italic_p ( italic_x | italic_z ). This method eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers.\n\n\n\nOur approach eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers. Vector-quantized tokenizers are difficult to train and are sensitive to gradient approximation strategies [51, 41, 40, 27]. Their reconstruction quality often falls short compared to continuous-valued counterparts [42].\nOur approach allows autoregressive models to enjoy the benefits of higher-quality, non-quantized tokenizers.\n\n\nTo broaden the scope, we further unify standard autoregressive (AR)", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDiffusion and score-based generative models\u00a0[23, 52, 54, 19, 53] have demonstrated promising results for high-fidelity image generation\u00a0[8, 37, 43, 45, 47].\nThese models generate images through an iterative process of gradually denoising Gaussian random noise to create realistic samples\nCentral to this process is a neural network, tasked with denoising the inputs through a mean squared error loss function.\nTraditionally, U-Net architectures\u00a0[46] (enhanced with residual blocks\u00a0[15] and self-attention blocks\u00a0[58] at lower resolution) have been prevalent. However, recent advancements have introduced Transformer-based designs\u00a0[58, 9], offering superior performance and scalability.\n\n\nIn practice, Transformer-based architectures face the challenge of balancing visual fidelity and computational complexity, primarily stemming from the self-attention operation and the patchification process employed for downsampling inputs\u00a0[9] (i.e., a smaller patch size results in better visual fidelity at the cost of a longer token length and thus more computational complexity by the self-attention operation).\nThe quadratic complexity inherent in self-attention concerning token length necessitates larger patch sizes to facilitate more efficient attention computations.\nHowever, the adoption of large patch sizes inevitably compromises the model\u2019s capacity to capture finer visual details, resulting in image distortion (i.e., low visual fidelity).\nThis dilemma prompts DiT\u00a0[40] to conduct a systematic study on the impact of patch size on image distortion, as depicted in Fig.\u00a07 of their paper.\nConsequently, they settled on a patch size of 2 for their final design.\nSimilarly, U-ViT\u00a0[3] opted for a patch size of 2 for input sizes of 256\u00d7256256256256\\times 256256 \u00d7 256 and a patch size of 4 for 512\u00d7512512512512\\times 512512 \u00d7 512 images, effectively balancing the token length for different image sizes.\nDespite these meticulous adjustments, the generated results still exhibit discernible image distortion, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01.\n\n\nOne simplistic solution to mitigate image distortion in Transformer-based architectures is adopting a patch size of 1, but this significantly increases computational complexity.\nInstead, inspired by the success of image cascade\u00a0[20, 47] which generate images at increasing resolutions, we propose a feature cascade approach that progressively upsamples lower-resolution features to higher resolutions, alleviating distortion in image generation.\nIn this study, we present DiMR, which enhances the Diffusion model with a Multi-Resolution network.\nDiMR tackles the challenge of balancing visual detail capture and computational complexity through improvements in the denoising backbone architecture.\nWe employ a multi-resolution network design that comprises multiple branches to progressively refine features from low to high resolution, preserving intricate details within the input data.\nSpecifically, the first branch handling the lowest resolution incorporates Transformer blocks\u00a0[58], leveraging the superior performance and scalability observed in prior works\u00a0[3, 40], while the remaining branches utilize ConvNeXt blocks\u00a0[34], which are efficient for high resolution features.\nThe network processes inputs progressively from the lowest resolution, with additional features from the preceding resolution.\nThe last branch refines features at the same spatial resolution as the input, effectively mitigating image distortion arising from the patchification.\n\n\nAdditionally, we observe that existing time conditioning mechanisms\u00a0[41, 25, 8], such as adaptive layer normalization (adaLN)\u00a0[40], are parameter-intensive. In contrast, we propose a more efficient approach, Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), that integrates time-dependent parameters directly into layer normalization\u00a0[2], achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.\n\n\nTo demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate DiMR on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark\u00a0[7].\nOn ImageNet 64\u00d764646464\\times 6464 \u00d7", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, image generation has experienced remarkable progress, driven by the significant advancements in both transformers\u00a0[19, 62, 66, 10, 67, 68] and diffusion models\u00a0[16, 55, 29, 49, 21].\nMirroring the trends in generative language models\u00a0[48, 59], the architecture of many contemporary image generation models incorporate a standard image tokenizer and de-tokenizer. This array of models utilizes tokenized image representations\u2014ranging from continuous\u00a0[34] to discrete vectors\u00a0[54, 61, 19]\u2014to perform a critical function: translating raw pixels into a latent space. The latent space (e.g., 32\u00d732323232\\times 3232 \u00d7 32) is significantly more compact than the original image space (256\u00d7256\u00d732562563256\\times 256\\times 3256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 3). It offers a compressed yet expressive representation, and thus not only facilitates efficient training and inference of generative models but also paves the way to scale up the model size.\n\n\nAlthough image tokenizers achieve great success in image generation workflows, they encounter a fundamental limitation tied to their intrinsic design. These tokenizers are based on an assumption that the latent space should retain a 2D structure, to maintain a direct mapping for locations between the latent tokens and image patches. For example, the top-left latent token directly corresponds to the top-left image patch. This restricts the tokenizer\u2019s ability to effectively leverage the redundancy inherent in images to cultivate a more compressed latent space.\n\n\nTaking one step back, we raise the question \u201cis 2D structure necessary for image tokenization?\u201d\nTo answer the question, we draw inspiration from several image understanding tasks where model predictions are based solely on high-level information extracted from input images\n\u2014such as in image classification\u00a0[17], object detection\u00a0[8, 77], segmentation\u00a0[64, 71], and multi-modal large language models\u00a0[1, 40].\nThese tasks do not need de-tokenizers, since the outputs typically manifest in specific structures other than images.\nIn other words, they often format a higher-level 1D sequence as output that can still capture all task-relevant information.\nPrior arts, such as object queries\u00a0[8, 64] or the perceiver resampler\u00a0[1], encode images into a 1D sequence of a predetermined number of tokens (e.g., 64).\nThese tokens facilitate the generation of outputs like bounding boxes or captions.\nThe success of these methods motivates us to investigate a more compact 1D sequence as image latent representation in the context of image reconstruction and generation.\nIt is noteworthy that the synthesis of both high-level and low-level information is crucial for the generation of high-quality images, providing a challenge for extremely compact latent representations.\n\n\nIn this work, we introduce a transformer-based framework\u00a0[62, 17] designed to tokenize an image to a 1D discrete sequence, which can later be decoded back to the image space via a de-tokenizer.\nSpecifically, we present Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TiTok), consisting of a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder, a ViT decoder, and a vector quantizer following the typical Vector-Quantized (VQ) model designs\u00a0[19].\nIn the tokenization phase, the image is split and flattened into a series of patches, followed by concatenation with a 1D sequence of latent tokens. After the feature encoding process of ViT encoder, these latent tokens build the latent representation of the image. Subsequent to the vector quantization step\u00a0[61, 19], the ViT decoder is utilized to reconstruct the input images from the masked token sequence\u00a0[15, 24].\n\n\nBuilding", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nBuilt upon autoregressive models, large language models (LLMs)\u00a0[Vaswani et\u00a0al. 2017; Devlin et\u00a0al. 2018; Radford et\u00a0al. 2018; Raffel et\u00a0al. 2020; Radford et\u00a0al. 2019; Brown et\u00a0al. 2020; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2022] generate the text by predicting the next token in a sequence.

They introduce image tokenizers to convert continuous images to discrete tokens, and apply autoregressive models to generate image tokens in the way of next-token prediction.\nThey demonstrate strong performance among their contemporaries\u00a0[Brock et\u00a0al. 2018; Ho et\u00a0al. 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol 2021] in the year before 2022. However, their open-source communities are not well developed, which largely limits their further improvements.\n\n\nAt the same period, another image generation method, diffusion models\u00a0[Song & Ermon 2019; Ho et\u00a0al. 2020; Song et\u00a0al. 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol 2021; Nichol et\u00a0al. 2021; Lu et\u00a0al. 2022a; Ho et\u00a0al. 2022a; Ho & Salimans 2022; Rombach et\u00a0al. 2022; Ramesh et\u00a0al. 2022; Saharia et\u00a0al. 2022; Rombach et\u00a0al. 2022] develop rapidly. Along with their open-source communities, they dominate the field of visual generation up to today.\nHowever, diffusion models share distinct paradigms with autoregressive language models, which poses a huge challenge to building a unified model between language and vision.\n\n\nIn this work, we are committed to pushing the envelope of autoregressive models on image generation further: continuing its research methodology and contributing to open-source community. Reviewing the literature on image generation in the year before 2024, we identify three keys to existing advanced models\u00a0[Peebles & Xie 2023; Podell et\u00a0al. 2023; Xue et\u00a0al. 2023; Chen et\u00a0al. 2023b, c; Betker et\u00a0al. 2023; Li et\u00a0al. 2024; Esser et\u00a0al. 2024]: 1) well-designed image compressors, 2) scalable image generation models and 3) high-quality training data. Motivated by this, we reexamine the designs of image tokenizers (image compressors for autoregressive models), the scalability properties of image generation models, and the effects of training data.\n\n\nTowards a potential unified model between\nlanguage and vision, our design is reducing the inductive biases on visual signals and adopting the same architecture as LLM. This belongs to a different research philosophy with recent works\u00a0[Chang et\u00a0al. 2022; Yu et\u00a0al. 2023b; Tian et\u00a0al. 2024] that modify the architectures under the guidance of vision-oriented designs. For example, MaskGIT\u00a0[Chang et\u00a0al. 2022], MAGVIT\u00a0[Yu et\u00a0al. 2023a, b] adopt the masked image modeling strategy, VAR\u00a0[Tian et\u00a0al. 2024] uses hierarchical multi-scale property. Although they have succeeded in achieving leading image generation performance, and even better than diffusion models, it is still not clear whether the original language model architectures", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe advent of GPT series\u00a0[65, 66, 15, 62, 1] and more autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs)\u00a0[22, 4, 38, 82, 83, 90, 78, 5, 79] has heralded a new epoch in the field of artificial intelligence.\nThese models exhibit promising intelligence in generality and versatility that, despite issues like hallucinations\u00a0[39], are still considered to take a solid step toward the general artificial intelligence (AGI).\nAt the core of these models is a self-supervised learning strategy \u2013 predicting the next token in a sequence, a simple yet profound approach.\nStudies into the success of these large AR models have highlighted their scalability and generalizabilty:\nthe former, as exemplified by scaling laws\u00a0[43, 35], allows us to predict large model\u2019s performance from smaller ones and thus guides better resource allocation, while the latter, as evidenced by zero-shot and few-shot learning\u00a0[66, 15], underscores the unsupervised-trained models\u2019 adaptability to diverse, unseen tasks. These properties reveal AR models\u2019 potential in learning from vast unlabeled data, encapsulating the essence of \u201cAGI\u201d.\n\n\nIn parallel, the field of computer vision has been striving to develop large autoregressive or world models\u00a0[58, 57, 6], aiming to emulate their impressive scalability and generalizability.\nTrailblazing efforts like VQGAN and DALL-E\u00a0[30, 67] along with their successors\u00a0[68, 92, 50, 99] have showcased the potential of AR models in image generation. These models utilize a visual tokenizer to discretize continuous images into grids of 2D tokens, which are then flattened to a 1D sequence for AR learning (Fig.\u00a02\u2009b), mirroring the process of sequential language modeling (Fig.\u00a02\u2009a).\nHowever, the scaling laws of these models remain underexplored, and more frustratingly, their performance significantly lags behind diffusion models [63, 3, 51], as shown in Fig.\u00a03.\nIn contrast to the remarkable achievements of LLMs, the power of autoregressive models in computer vision appears to be somewhat locked.\n\n\nFigure 3: Scaling behavior of different model families on ImageNet 256\u00d7\\times\u00d7256 generation benchmark.\nThe FID of the validation set serves as a reference lower bound (1.78).\nVAR with 2B parameters reaches an FID of 1.73, surpassing L-DiT with 3B or 7B parameters.\n\n\n\nAutoregressive modeling requires defining the order of data.\nOur work reconsiders how to \u201corder\u201d an image:\nHumans typically perceive or create images in a hierachical manner, first capturing the global structure and then local details.\nThis multi-scale, coarse-to-fine nature suggests an \u201corder\u201d for images.\nAlso inspired by the widespread multi-scale designs\u00a0[54, 52, 81, 44], we define autoregressive learning for images as \u201cnext-scale prediction\u201d in Fig.\u00a02 (c), diverging from the conventional \u201cnext-token prediction\u201d in Fig.\u00a02 (b).\nOur approach begins by encoding an image into multi-scale token maps. The autoregressive process is then started from the 1\u00d7\\times\u00d71 token map, and progressively expands in resolution: at each step, the transformer predicts the next higher-resolution token map conditioned on all previous ones.\nWe refer to this methodology as Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling.\n\n\nVAR directly leverages GPT-2-like transformer architecture\u00a0[66] for visual autoregressive learning.\nOn the ImageNet 256\u00d7\\times\u00d7256 benchmark, VAR significantly improves its AR baseline, achieving a Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) of 1.73 and an inception score (IS) of 350.2, with inference speed 20\u00d7\\times\u00d7 faster (see Sec.\u00a07 for details).\nNotably, VAR surpasses the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) \u2013 the foundation of leading diffusion systems like Stable Diffusion 3.0 and", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nTransformers\u00a0[73] are highly scalable and parallelizable neural network architectures designed to win the hardware lottery\u00a0[39]. This desirable property has encouraged the research community to increasingly favor transformers over domain-specific architectures in diverse fields such as language\u00a0[55, 56, 57, 26], audio\u00a0[1], speech\u00a0[58], vision\u00a0[18, 30], and robotics\u00a0[7, 89, 5]. Such a trend towards unification allows researchers to share and build upon advancements in traditionally disparate domains. Thus, leading to a virtuous cycle of innovation and improvement in model design favoring transformers.\n\n\nA notable exception to this trend is generative modelling of videos. Diffusion models\u00a0[67, 69] have emerged as a leading paradigm for generative modelling of images\u00a0[33, 16] and videos\u00a0[36]. However, the U-Net architecture\u00a0[62, 33], consisting of a series of convolutional\u00a0[46] and self-attention\u00a0[73] layers, has been the predominant backbone in all video diffusion approaches\u00a0[33, 16, 36]. This preference stems from the fact that the memory demands of full attention mechanisms in transformers scale quadratically with input sequence length. Such scaling leads to prohibitively high costs when processing high-dimensional signals like video.\n\n\nLatent diffusion models (LDMs)\u00a0[61] reduce computational requirements by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space derived from an autoencoder\u00a0[75, 72, 20]. A critical design choice in this context is the type of latent space employed: spatial compression (per frame latents) versus spatiotemporal compression. Spatial compression is often preferred because it enables leveraging pre-trained image autoencoders and LDMs, which are trained on large paired image-text datasets. However, this choice increases network complexity and limits the use of transformers as backbones, especially in generating high-resolution videos due to memory constraints. On the other hand, while spatiotemporal compression can mitigate these issues, it precludes the use of paired image-text datasets, which are much larger and diverse than their video counterparts.\n\n\nWe present Window Attention Latent Transformer (W.A.L.T): a transformer-based method for latent video diffusion models (LVDMs). Our method consists of two stages. First, an autoencoder maps both videos and images into a unified, lower-dimensional latent space. This design choice enables training a single generative model jointly on image and video datasets and significantly reduces the computational burden for generating high resolution videos. Subsequently, we propose a new design of transformer blocks for latent video diffusion modeling which is composed of self-attention layers that alternate between non-overlapping, window-restricted spatial and spatiotemporal attention. This design offers two primary benefits: firstly, the use of local window attention significantly lowers computational demands. Secondly, it facilitates joint training, where the spatial layers independently process images and video frames, while the spatiotemporal layers are dedicated to modeling the temporal relationships in videos.\n\n\nWhile conceptually simple, our method provides the first empirical evidence of transformers\u2019 superior generation quality and parameter efficiency in latent video diffusion on public benchmarks. Specifically, we report state-of-the-art results on class-conditional video generation (UCF-101\u00a0[70]), frame prediction (Kinetics-600\u00a0[9]) and class conditional image generation (ImageNet\u00a0[15]) without using classifier free guidance. Finally, to showcase the scalability and efficiency of our method we also demonstrate results on the challenging task of photorealistic text-to-video generation. We train a cascade of three models consisting of a base latent video diffusion model, and two video super-resolution diffusion models to generate", "Abstract\nIn this technical report, we present a reproduction of MaskGIT: Masked Gener-\native Image Transformer [3], using PyTorch [11].

Over time, LMs have expanded their capabilities to generate content in various modalities, asserting their dominance in other domains like audio\u00a0(Agostinelli et\u00a0al., 2023), speech\u00a0(Rubenstein et\u00a0al., 2023), code generation\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023), medical applications\u00a0(Singhal et\u00a0al., 2023) and robotics\u00a0(Zitkovich et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\n\nLMs are capable of generating images and videos. To do so, the image pixels are mapped into a sequence of discrete tokens by a visual tokenizer (c.f. Section\u00a02). These tokens are then fed into the LM transformer, as if they were lexical words, for generative modeling. Despite notable advancements in employing LMs for visual generation\u00a0(Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Chang et\u00a0al., 2022), LMs still do not perform as well as diffusion models\u00a0(Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022).\nFor instance, when evaluating on the ImageNet dataset, a gold standard benchmark for image generation, the best language model\u00a0(Lee et\u00a0al., 2022) underperforms\nthe diffusion model\u00a0(Gao et\u00a0al., 2023) by a substantial 48% margin (FID 3.41 vs. 1.79 when generating images at the 256\u00d7\\times\u00d7256 resolution).\n\n\nWhy do language models lag behind diffusion models in visual generation? This paper suggests that a primary reason is the lack of a good visual representation, resembling our natural language system, for effectively modeling the visual world.\nTo substantiate this hypothesis, this paper shows that, when utilizing a good visual tokenizer, the masked language model\u00a0(Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019; Chang et\u00a0al., 2022; Yu et\u00a0al., 2023a) surpasses the state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of both generation fidelity and efficiency across image and video benchmarks, given the same training data, comparable model size, and training budget. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first evidence that language models beat diffusion models on the hallmark ImageNet benchmark.\n\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that our intention is not to assert whether the language model is superior to others, but to promote the exploration of visual tokenization methods for LLMs.\nA fundamental difference of LLMs from other models, such as diffusion models, is that LLMs utilize a discrete latent format: tokens obtained from a visual tokenizer.\nWe show that the values of these discrete visual tokens should not be overlooked considering their distinct advantages as follows. (1) Compatibility with LLMs. The main advantage of a token representation is that it shares the same form as language tokens, making it straightforward to leverage the optimizations our community has developed over many years for LLMs. This includes faster training and inference speeds\u00a0(Shazeer, 2019; Lester et\u00a0al., 2021), advancements in model infrastructure\u00a0(Dao et\u00a0al., 2022; Du et\u00a0al., 2022), learning recipes for model scaling\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2022), and GPU/TPU optimization, among other innovations. Unifying vision and language by the same token space could set the stage for a true multimodal LLM that can understand, generate, and reason within our visual environment.\n(2) Compressed representation. The discrete token may offer a fresh perspective on video compression. The\nvisual tokens can serve as a new video compression format to reduce disk storage and bandwidth during internet transfers. Unlike compressed RGB pixels, these tokens can be fed directly into generative models, bypassing the conventional", "ABSTRACT\nWe propose to replace vector quantization (VQ) in the latent representation of\nVQ-V AEs with a simple scheme termed finite scalar quantization (FSQ), where\nwe project the V AE representation down to a few dimensions (typically less than\n10). Each dimension is quantized to a small set of fixed values, leading to an\n(implicit) codebook given by the product of these sets. By appropriately choosing\nthe number of dimensions and values each dimension can take, we obtain the same\ncodebook size as in VQ. On top of such discrete representations, we can train the\nsame models that have been trained on VQ-V AE representations. For example,\nautoregressive and masked transformer models for image generation, multimodal\ngeneration, and dense prediction computer vision tasks. Concretely, we employ\nFSQ with MaskGIT for image generation, and with UViM for depth estimation,\ncolorization, and panoptic segmentation. Despite the much simpler design of FSQ,\nwe obtain competitive performance in all these tasks. We emphasize that FSQ\ndoes not suffer from codebook collapse and does not need the complex machinery\nemployed in VQ (commitment losses, codebook reseeding, code splitting, entropy\npenalties, etc.) to learn expressive discrete representations. Code on GitHub.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nVector quantization (VQ), initially introduced by Gray (1984), has recently seen a renaissance in the\ncontext of learning discrete representations with neural networks. Spurred by the success of VQ-\nV AE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017), Esser et al. (2020) and Villegas et al. (2022) showed that training\nan autoregressive transformer on the representations of a VQ-V AE trained with a GAN loss enables\npowerful image and video generation models, respectively. At the same time, VQ has become\npopular component in image (Bao et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023) and audio (Baevski et al., 2019)\nrepresentation learning, and is a promising building block for the next generation of multimodal\nlarge language models (Aghajanyan et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023; Aghajanyan et al., 2023).\nWhen training VQ-V AE, the goal is to learn a codebook Cwhose elements induce a compressed,\nsemantic representation of the input data (typically images). In the forward pass, an image xis en-\ncoded into a representation z(typically a sequence of feature vectors), and each vector in zquantized\nto (i.e., replaced with) the closest vector in C. The quantization operation is not differentiable. When\ntraining a V AE with VQ in the latent representation, Van Den Oord et al. (2017) use the straight-\nthrough estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013), copying the gradients from the decoder input to the\nencoder output, resulting in gradients to the encoder. Since this still does not produce gradients\nfor the codebook vectors, they further introduce two auxiliary losses to pull the codeword vectors\ntowards the (unquantized) representation vectors and vice-versa.\nThe above formulation is challenging to optimize, and leads to the well-documented problem of un-\nderutilized codebooks (\u0141a \u00b4ncucki et al., 2020; Takida et al., 2022; Dhariwal et al., 2020; Huh et al.,\n2023): as the size of Cis increased, many codewords will be unused. Subsequent works aimed to im-\nprove this with various tricks such as reinitializing the entire codebook or some codewords Dhariwal\net al. (2020); \u0141a \u00b4ncucki et al. (2020), stochastic formulations Takida et al. (2022), etc.(see Sec. 2).\n\u25e6Significant technical contributions.\n1arXiv:2309.15505v2  [cs.CV]  12 Oct 2023FSQ\n(1, 0, -1)1\n0\n-1 VQ\nFigure", " Introduction\nVector Quantisation (VQ) [12] is a basic building block\nof many machine learning techniques.

This learning process reveals that DPMs fail to learn the associated relations among semantic parts and independently learn each semantic part.\nThis phenomenon is because DPMs maximize the log probability of real data by minimizing the per-pixel prediction loss, which ignores the associated relations among object parts in an image, thus resulting in their slow learning progress.\n\n\nInspired by the above observation, we propose an effective Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT) to improve the training efficiency of DPMs.\nMDT proposes a mask latent modeling scheme designed for transformer-based DPMs to explicitly enhance contextual learning ability and improve the associated relation learning among semantic parts in an image.\nSpecifically, following\u00a0[42, 39], MDT operates the diffusion process in the latent space to save computational costs.\nIt masks certain image tokens and designs an asymmetric diffusion transformer structure to predict masked tokens from unmasked ones in a diffusion generation manner.\nTo this end, the asymmetric structure contains an encoder, a side-interpolater, and a decoder.\nThe encoder and decoder modify the transformer block in DiT [39] by inserting global and local token position information to help predict masked tokens.\nThe encoder only processes remaining unmasked tokens during training, handling all tokens during inference, as there are no masks.\nTo ensure the decoder always processes all tokens for training prediction or inference generation, a side-interpolater", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nScore-based diffusion models have become increasingly popular for data generation. In essence the idea is simple: one pre-defines a diffusion process, which gradually destroys information by adding random noise. Then, the opposite direction defines the denoising process, which is approximated with a neural network.\n\n\nDiffusion models have shown to be extremely effective for image, audio, and video generation. However, for higher resolutions the literature typically operates on lower dimensional latent spaces (latent diffusion) (Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022) or divides the generative process into multiple sub-problems, for instance via super-resolution (cascaded diffusion) (Ho et\u00a0al., 2022) or mixtures-of-denoising-experts (Balaji et\u00a0al., 2022). The disadvantage is that these approaches introduce additional complexity and usually do not support a single end-to-end training setup.\n\n\nFigure 2: Generated images with simple diffusion. Importantly, each image is generated in full image space by a single diffusion model without any cascades (super-resolution) or mixtures of experts. Samples are drawn from the U-Net model with guidance scale 4.\n\n\nIn this paper, we aim to improve standard denoising diffusion for higher resolutions while keeping the model as simple as possible. Our four main findings are that 1) the noise schedule should be adjusted for larger images, adding more noise as the resolution increases. 2) It is sufficient to scale the U-Net architecture on the 16\u00d716161616\\times 1616 \u00d7 16 resolution to improve performance. Taking this one step further is the U-ViT architecture, a U-Net with a transformer backbone. 3) Dropout should be added for improved performance, but not on the highest resolution feature maps. And finally 4) for higher resolutions, one can down-sample without performance degradation.\nMost importantly, these results are obtained using just a single model and an end-to-end training setup. After using existing distillation techniques which now only have to be applied to a single stage, the model can generate an image in 0.4 seconds.\n\n \n\n2 Background: Diffusion Models\n\nA diffusion model generates data by learning the reverse of a destruction process.

Over the past couple of years, GANs [14]\nwere the state-of-the-art, with their latent space and con-\nditional inputs being well-studied for controllable manipu-\nlation [48, 60] and generation [27, 29, 47, 82]. Text condi-\ntional autoregressive [52, 74] and diffusion [51, 56] models\nhave demonstrated astonishing image quality and concept\ncoverage, due to their more stable learning objectives and\nlarge-scale training on web image-text paired data. These\nmodels have gained attention even among the general public\ndue to their practical use cases ( e.g., art design and creation).\nDespite exciting progress, existing large-scale text-to-\nimage generation models cannot be conditioned on other\ninput modalities apart from text, and thus lack the ability to\nprecisely localize concepts, use reference images, or other\nconditional inputs to control the generation process. The cur-\nrent input, i.e., natural language alone, restricts the way that\ninformation can be expressed. For example, it is difficult to\ndescribe the precise location of an object using text, whereas\nbounding boxes / keypoints can easily achieve this, as shown\nin Figure 1. While conditional diffusion models [10, 53, 55]\nand GANs [26, 37, 48, 71] that take in input modalities other\nthan text for inpainting, layout2img generation, etc., do exist,\nthey rarely combine those inputs for controllable text2img\ngeneration.\nMoreover, prior generative models\u2014regardless of the\ngenerative model family\u2014are usually independently trained\non each task-specific dataset. In contrast, in the recognition\nfield, the long-standing paradigm has been to build recogni-\ntion models [32, 42, 84] by starting from a foundation model\npretrained on large-scale image data [4,16,17] or image-text\npairs [33, 50, 75]. Since diffusion models have been trained\non billions of image-text pairs [53], a natural question is:\nCan we build upon existing pretrained diffusion models and\nendow them with new conditional input modalities? In this\nway, analogous to the recognition literature, we may be able\nto achieve better performance on other generation tasks due\nto the vast concept knowledge that the pretrained models\nhave, while acquiring more controllability over existing text-\nto-image generation models.\nWith the above aims, we propose a method for providing\nnew grounding conditional inputs to pretrained text-to-image\ndiffusion models. As shown in Figure 1, we still retain the\ntext caption as input, but also enable other input modalities\nsuch as bounding boxes for grounding concepts, grounding\nreference images, grounding part keypoints, etc. The key\nchallenge is preserving the original vast concept knowledge\nin the pretrained model while learning to inject the new\ngrounding information. To prevent knowledge forgetting,\nwe propose to freeze the original model weights and add\nnew trainable gated Transformer layers [67] that take in the\nnew grounding input ( e.g., bounding box). During training,we gradually fuse the new grounding information into the\npretrained model using a gated mechanism [1]. This design\nenables flexibility in the sampling process during generation\nfor improved quality and controllability; for example, we\nshow that using the full model (all layers) in the first half of\nthe sampling steps and only using the original layers (without\nthe gated Transformer layers) in the latter half can lead\nto generation results in Figure 17 18 19 20 21 22. Note that our keypoint\nmodel only uses keypoint annotations from COCO [41]\nwhich is not linked with person identity, but it can suc-\ncessfully utilize and combine the knowledge learned in the\ntext2img training stage to control keypoints of a specific\nperson. Out", " Introduction\nGenerative image models conditioned on text prompts have taken an enormous leap in quality and \ufb02exibility in the last few\nyears (Ramesh et al., 2022; Nichol et al., 2021; Saharia et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; Midjourney,\n2022). This was enabled by a combination of deep learning architecture innovations (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Vaswani\net al., 2017); novel training paradigms such as masked modeling for both language (Devlin et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020)\nand vision tasks (He et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2022); new families of generative models such as diffusion (Ho et al., 2020;\nRombach et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022) and masking-based generation (Chang et al., 2022); and \ufb01nally, the availability\nof large scale image-text paired datasets (Schuhmann et al., 2021).\nIn this work, we present a new model for text-to-image synthesis using a masked image modeling approach (Chang et al.,\n2022). Our image decoder architecture is conditioned on embeddings from a pre-trained and frozen T5-XXL (Raffel et al.,\n2020) large language model (LLM) encoder. In agreement with Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022), we \ufb01nd that conditioning on a\npre-trained LLM is crucial for photorealistic, high quality image generation. Our models (except for the VQGAN quantizer)\nare built on the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture.\nWe have trained a sequence of Muse models, ranging in size from 632M parameters to 3B parameters (for the image decoder;\nthe T5-XXL model has an additional 4.6B parameters). Each model consists of several sub-models (Figure 3): First, we\nhave a pair of VQGAN \u201ctokenizer\u201d models (Esser et al., 2021b), which can encode an input image to a sequence of discrete\ntokens as well as decode a token sequence back to an image. We use two VQGANs, one for 256x256 resolution (\u201clow-res\u201d)\nand another for 512x512 resolution (\u201chigh-res\u201d). Second, we have a base masked image model, which contains the bulk\nof our parameters. This model takes a sequence of partially masked low-res tokens and predicts the marginal distribution\n*Equal contributionyCore contribution.

Over the past \ufb01ve years, neural architec-\ntures for natural language processing [8, 42], vision [10]\nand several other domains have largely been subsumed by\ntransformers [60]. Many classes of image-level genera-\ntive models remain holdouts to the trend, though\u2014while\ntransformers see widespread use in autoregressive mod-\nels [3,6,43,47], they have seen less adoption in other gener-\native modeling frameworks. For example, diffusion models\nhave been at the forefront of recent advances in image-level\ngenerative models [9,46]; yet, they all adopt a convolutional\nU-Net architecture as the de-facto choice of backbone.\n*Work done during an internship at Meta AI, FAIR Team.\nCode and project page available here.\n1arXiv:2212.09748v2  [cs.CV]  2 Mar 2023520 80 320GflopsDiameterFigure 2.

Performance steadily improves in FID as model \ufb02ops increase.\nRight: Our best model, DiT-XL/2, is compute-ef\ufb01cient and outperforms all prior U-Net-based diffusion models, like ADM and LDM.\nThe seminal work of Ho et al. [19] \ufb01rst introduced the\nU-Net backbone for diffusion models. Having initially seen\nsuccess within pixel-level autoregressive models and con-\nditional GANs [23], the U-Net was inherited from Pixel-\nCNN++ [52, 58] with a few changes. The model is con-\nvolutional, comprised primarily of ResNet [15] blocks. In\ncontrast to the standard U-Net [49], additional spatial self-\nattention blocks, which are essential components in trans-\nformers, are interspersed at lower resolutions. Dhariwal and\nNichol [9] ablated several architecture choices for the U-\nNet, such as the use of adaptive normalization layers [40] to\ninject conditional information and channel counts for con-\nvolutional layers. However, the high-level design of the U-\nNet from Ho et al. has largely remained intact.\nWith this work, we aim to demystify the signi\ufb01cance of\narchitectural choices in diffusion models and offer empiri-\ncal baselines for future generative modeling research. We\nshow that the U-Net inductive bias is notcrucial to the per-\nformance of diffusion models, and they can be readily re-\nplaced with standard designs such as transformers. As a\nresult, diffusion models are well-poised to bene\ufb01t from the\nrecent trend of architecture uni\ufb01cation\u2014e.g., by inheriting\nbest practices and training recipes from other domains, as\nwell as retaining favorable properties like scalability, ro-\nbustness and ef\ufb01ciency. A standardized architecture would\nalso open up new possibilities for cross-domain research.\nIn this paper, we focus on a new class of diffusion models\nbased on transformers. We call them Diffusion Transform-\ners, or DiTs for short. DiTs adhere to the best practices of\nVision Transformers (ViTs) [10], which have been shown to\nscale more effectively for visual recognition than traditional\nconvolutional networks (e.g., ResNet [15]).More speci\ufb01cally, we study the scaling behavior of trans-\nformers with respect to network complexity vs. sample\nquality . We show that by constructing and benchmark-\ning the DiT design space under the Latent Diffusion Mod-\nels(LDMs) [48] framework, where diffusion models are\ntrained within a V AE\u2019s latent space, we can successfully\nreplace the U-Net backbone with a transformer. We further\nshow that DiTs are scalable architectures for diffusion mod-\nels: there is a strong correlation between the network com-\nplexity (measured by G\ufb02ops) vs. sample quality (measured\nby FID). By simply scaling-up DiT and training an LDM\nwith a high-capacity backbone (118.6 G\ufb02ops), we are", " Introduction\nRecent years have witnessed significant advances in\nimage and video content creation based on learning\nframeworks ranging from generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) [15, 43, 48, 58, 65], diffusion models [25, 33, 35,\n47, 64], to vision transformers [44, 45, 68]. Inspired by\nthe recent success of generative image transformers such as\nDALL\u00b7E [46] and other approaches [12,18,20,72], we pro-\npose an efficient and effective video generation model by\nleveraging masked token modeling and multi-task learning.\nWe introduce the MAsked Generative VIdeo Trans-\nformer ( MAGVIT ) for multi-task video generation. Specif-\nically, we build and train a single MAGVIT model to per-\nform a variety of diverse video generation tasks and demon-\nstrate the model\u2019s efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility\nagainst state-of-the-art approaches. Fig. 1(a) shows the\nquality metrics of MAGVIT on a few benchmarks with ef-\nficiency comparisons in (b), and generated examples under\ndifferent task setups such as frame prediction/interpolation,\nout/in-painting, and class conditional generation in (c).MAGVIT models a video as a sequence of visual tokens\nin the latent space and learns to predict masked tokens with\nBERT [17]. There are two main modules in the proposed\nframework. First, we design a 3D quantization model to\ntokenize a video, with high fidelity, into a low-dimensional\nspatial-temporal manifold [21, 70]. Second, we propose an\neffective masked token modeling (MTM) scheme for multi-\ntask video generation. Unlike conventional MTM in image\nunderstanding [66] or image/video synthesis [12,26,28], we\npresent an embedding method to model a video condition\nusing a multivariate mask and show its efficacy in training.\nWe conduct extensive Appendix B.1. The tasks are Frame Predic-\ntion (FP), Frame Interpolation (FI), Central Outpainting (OPC),\nVertical Outpainting (OPV), Horizontal Outpainting (OPH), Dy-\nnamic Outpainting (OPD), Central Inpainting (IPC), Dynamic In-\npainting (IPD), Class-conditional Generation (CG), and Class-\nconditional Frame Prediction (CFP).\n\u2022 Central Inpainting (IPC)\n\u2013Interior condition: everything but a rectangle at the\ncenter with height hand width w;h= 0.5H,w=\n0.5W.\n\u2013Padding: zero padding.\n\u2022 Dynamic Inpainting (IPD)\n\u2013Interior condition: everything but a vertically centered\nmoving rectangle with height hand width w;h=\n0.5H,w= 0.5W.\n\u2013Direction of movement: left to right.\n\u2013Padding: zero padding.\n\u2022 Class-conditional Generation (CG)\n\u2013Prefix condition: class label.\n\u2022 Class-conditional Frame Prediction (CFP)\n\u2013Prefix condition: class label.\n\u2013Interior condition: tframes at the beginning; t= 1.\n\u2013Padding: replicate the last given frame.\nB.2.

Recently, contrastive loss functions combined with large\nneural networks have led to breakthroughs in the generalization capabilities of vision and language\nmodels [ 58,59,66]. For instance, OpenAI\u2019s CLIP models [ 58] achieved large gains in zero-shot\nclassi\ufb01cation on ImageNet [ 65], improving from the prior top-1 accuracy of 11.5% [ 41] to 76.2%.\n1Project page: https://laion.ai/laion-5b-a-new-era-of-open-large-scale-multi-modal-datasets/\n1arXiv:2210.08402v1  [cs.CV]  16 Oct 2022In addition, CLIP achieved unprecedented performance gains on multiple challenging distribution\nshifts [3,23,61,70,78,82]. Inspired by CLIP\u2019s performance, numerous groups have further improved\nimage-text models by increasing the amount of computation and the training set size [ 28,54,89,94].\nAnother recent success of multimodal learning is in image generation, where DALL-E [ 59] and later\nmodels [52,60,64,66,90] demonstrated the potential of text-guided image generation by producing\nhigh-quality images speci\ufb01c to the provided text.\nA critical ingredient in this new generation of image-text models is the pre-training dataset. All of\nthe aforementioned advances rely on large datasets containing hundreds of millions or even billions\nof image-text pairs, e.g., 400 million for CLIP [ 58] and 6.6 billion for BASIC [ 54]. However, none\nof these datasets are publicly available . While OpenAI still released the CLIP models publicly [ 58],\nlater papers made neither the pre-training dataset nor the resulting models available to the wider\nresearch community [ 2,28,52,54,66,89,90]. As a result, research in this area has pooled into a\nsmall number of industrial research labs, limiting transparency and impeding research progress.\nIn this work, we address this challenge and make multimodal training more accessible by assembling\na public dataset that is suitable for training large image-text models. Speci\ufb01cally, we introduce\nLAION-5B, the largest public image-text dataset containing over 5.8 billion examples (see Table 1 for\na comparison). By starting from Common Crawl [1] and \ufb01ltering this data source with an existing\nCLIP model, we derive a dataset consisting of three parts: 2.32 billion English image-text examples,\n2.26 billion multilingual examples, and 1.27 billion examples that are not speci\ufb01c to a particular\nlanguage (e.g., places, products, etc.). Beyond assembling the dataset, we also explore its ethical\nimplications and \ufb02aws that emerge with large-scale data collection. By releasing LAION-5B publicly,\nwe o\ufb00er the \ufb01rst opportunity for the community to audit and re\ufb01ne a dataset of this magnitude.\nViT-B/32 ViT-B/16 ViT-L/14\nCLIP Vision Model010203040506070ImageNet1k Accuracy (%)Zero-Shot ImageNet1k Accuracy by Model and Dataset\nLAION-400M (Ours)\nCLIP WIT (OpenAI)\nFigure 1: Zero-Shot Accuracy.

A representative\nexample is U-Net based on a convolutional neural network\n1arXiv:2209.12152v4  [cs.CV]  25 Mar 2023(CNN) employed in prior work [25,65]. The CNN-based U-\nNet is characterized by a group of down-sampling blocks,\na group of up-sampling blocks, and long skip connections\nbetween the two groups, which dominates diffusion mod-\nels for image generation tasks [13, 52, 54, 56]. On the other\nhand, vision transformers (ViT) [16] have shown promise in\nvarious vision tasks, where ViT is comparable or even supe-\nrior to CNN based approaches [9,21,38,68,81]. Therefore,\na very natural question arises: whether the reliance of the\nCNN-based U-Net is necessary in diffusion models?\nIn this paper, we design a simple and general ViT-based\narchitecture called U-ViT (Figure 1). Following the de-\nsign methodology of transformers, U-ViT treats all inputs\nincluding the time, condition and noisy image patches as\ntokens. Crucially, U-ViT employs long skip connections\nbetween shallow and deep layers inspired by U-Net. In-\ntuitively, low-level features are important to the pixel-level\nprediction objective in diffusion models and such connec-\ntions can ease the training of the corresponding prediction\nnetwork. Besides, U-ViT optionally adds an extra 3 \u00023 con-\nvolutional block before output for better visual quality. See\na systematical ablation study for all elements in Figure 2.\nWe evaluate U-ViT in three popular tasks: unconditional\nimage generation, class-conditional image generation and\ntext-to-image generation. In all settings, U-ViT is compara-\nble if not superior to a CNN-based U-Net of a similar size.\nIn particular, latent diffusion models with U-ViT achieve\nrecord-breaking FID scores of 2.29 in class-conditional im-\nage generation on ImageNet 256 \u0002256, and 5.48 in text-to-\nimage generation on MS-COCO, among Background\nDiffusion models [25, 62, 67] gradually inject noise to\ndata, and then reverse this process to generate data from\nnoise. The noise-injection process, also called the forward\nprocess, is formalized as a Markov chain:\nq(x1:Tjx0) =TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001):\nHerex0is the data,q(xtjxt\u00001) =N(xtjp\u000btxt\u00001;\ftI),\nand\u000btand\ftrepresent the noise schedule such that\n\u000bt+\ft= 1. To reverse this process, a Gaussian model\np(xt\u00001jxt) =N(xt\u00001j\u0016t(xt);\u001b2\ntI)is adopted to approx-\nimate the ground truth reverse transition q(xt\u00001jxt), andthe optimal mean [3] is\n\u0016\u0003\nt(xt) =1p\u000bt\u0012\nxt\u0000\ftp1\u0000\u000btE[\u000fjxt]\u0013\n:\nHere\u000bt=Qt\ni=1\u000bi, and\u000fis the standard Gaussian\nnoises injected to xt.

Although our MoVQ dramatically improves the image representation quality than the\nstate-of-the-art under the same compression ratio, the model sometimes generates images with a\nhigh-frequency appearance, while the structure information is missing. We believe this is partially\ndue to the multichannel representation we employed in our model. Therefore, a better generation\nmodel for modeling multichannel indexes needs to be further studied.\n9References\n[1]A. Brock, J. Donahue, and K. Simonyan.

In", " Introduction\nClass-conditional image synthesis is a challenging task, requiring the generation of varied and semantically\nmeaningful images with realistic details and few or none visual artifacts. The \feld has seen impressive\nprogress in the hand of mainly three techniques: large Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [3], di\u000busion\nmodels [9,19], and transformer-based models over a vector-quantized (VQ) latent space [12,5]. Each of these\ntechniques presents di\u000berent advantages trading-o\u000b model size, computational cost of sampling, image quality\nand diversity.\nBuilding upon the transformers [39] for the natural language generation tasks [4], generative vision trans-\nformers achieved impressive image generation performance. While early works applied an autoregressive\ntransformer in the VQ latent space [29,12], recently the state-of-the-art on the common ImageNet bench-\nmark was further advanced by a new model called MaskGIT [5] using mask-and-predict training inspired by\nBERT [8] and non-autoregressive sampling adapted from neural machine translation [13,26].\nTo be more speci\fc, during inference, MaskGIT [5] starts from a blank canvas with all the tokens masked\nout. In each step, it predicts all tokens in parallel but only keeps the ones with the highest prediction scores.\nThe remaining tokens are masked out and will be re-predicted (resampled) in the next iteration until all\ntokens are generated with a few iterations of re\fnement. The non-autoregressive nature of MaskGIT allows\norders-of-magnitude faster sampling, generating an image typically in 8-16 steps as opposed to hundreds of\nsteps in autoregressive transformers [12] and di\u000busion models [9,19].\nOne of the central challenges of iterative non-autoregressive generation is knowing how many and which\ntokens to keep and which to resample at each sampling step. For instance, MaskGIT [5] uses a prede\fned\nmasking schedule and keeps the predicted tokens for which the model's prediction is more con\fdent. However,\nthis procedure presents three notable drawbacks. First, to select tokens to resample, it relies on the generator's\npredicted con\fdences which can be sensitive to modeling errors. Secondly, the decision to reject or accept is\nmade independently for each token, which impedes capturing rich correlations between tokens. In addition,\nthe sampling procedure is greedy and \\non-regrettable\", which does not allow to correct previously sampled\ntokens, even if they become less likely given the latest context.\nIn this work, we propose Token-Critic , a second transformer that takes as input the output of the gener-\native transformer (or generator for short). Intuitively, the Token-Critic is trained to recognize con\fgurations\nof tokens likely under the real distribution, and those that were sampled from the generator. During the\niterative sampling process, the scores predicted by Token-Critic are used to select which token predictions\nare kept, and which are masked and resampled in the next iteration ( c.f. Fig. 1).arXiv:2209.04439v1  [cs.CV]  9 Sep 20222 Jos\u0013 e Lezama, Huiwen Chang, Lu Jiang, and Irfan Essa\nFig. 1: Overview of the sampling procedure using Token-Critic. At each sampling iteration, Token-Critic\npredicts a high score for the tokens that are more likely sampled together under the joint distribution.\nTokens with lower score are masked and resampled at the next iteration.\nWith Token-Critic we tackle the three aforementioned limitations: 1) the masking of tokens is delegated\nto the Token-Critic model, trained to distinguish which tokens are unlikely under the true distribution. 2)\nToken-Critic looks at the entire set of sampled tokens collectively, thus is capable of", " introduction to diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho\net al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; 2021). Diffusion models learn a series of state transitions to map noise\n\u000ffrom a known prior distribution to x0from the data distribution. To learn this (reverse) transition\nfrom the noise distribution to the data distribution, a forward transition from x0toxtis \ufb01rst de\ufb01ned:\nxt=p\n\r(t)x0+p\n1\u0000\r(t)\u000f; (1)\nwhere\u000f\u0018N(0;I),t\u0018U(0;T)is a continuous variable, and \r(t)is a monotonically decreasing\nfunction from 1 to 0. Instead of directly learning a neural net to model the transition from xtto\nxt\u0000\u0001, one can learn a neural net f(xt;t)to predictx0(or\u000f) fromxt, and estimate xt\u0000\u0001fromxt\nand estimated ~x0(or~\u000f). This training of f(xt;t)is based on denoising with a `2regression loss:\nLx0=Et\u0018U(0;T);\u000f\u0018N(0;1)kf(p\n\r(t)x0+p\n1\u0000\r(t)\u000f;t)\u0000x0k2: (2)\nTo generate samples from a learned model, it follows a series of (reverse) state transition xT!\nxT\u0000\u0001!\u0001\u0001\u0001!x0. This can be achieved by iteratively applying denoising function fon each state\nxtto estimatex0, and then make a transition to xt\u0000\u0001with the estimated ~x0(using transition rules\nsuch as those speci\ufb01ed in DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) or DDIM (Song et al., 2020)). Note that state\ntransitions in these diffusion models assume a continuous data space and state space. Therefore, one\ncannot directly apply it to model and generate discrete/categorical data.\nAnalog Bits A discrete data variable from an alphabet of size Kcan be represented using n=\ndlog2Kebits, asf0;1gn. Due to the discreteness, existing work has to re-formulate continuous\ndiffusion models by adopting a discrete data space and state space (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015;\nHoogeboom et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). In contrast, we propose to simply cast the binary bits\nf0;1gninto real numbers Rnfor the continuous diffusion models1. We term these real numbers\nanalog bits since they learn to share the same bimodal values as binary bits but are modeled as real\nnumbers. To draw samples, we follow the same procedure as sampling in a continuous diffusion\nmodel, except that we apply a quantization operation at the end by simply thresholding the generated\nanalog bits. This yields binary bits which can be then converted into original discrete/categorical\nvariables. Notably, there is no hard constraint to force the model to generate exact binary bits, but we\n1After casting as real numbers, one may also transform them by shifting and scaling from 0;1to\u0000b;b.\n2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\n\u0001\u0001\u0001xt+\u0001xtxt\u0000\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n~x0 ~x0\n0\n(a) Standard reverse diffusion steps.\u0001\u0001\u0001xt+\u0001xtxt\u0000\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n~x0 ~x0\n0\n(b) Self-Conditioning on the previous x0estimate.\nFigure 2: An illustration of reverse diffusion sampling steps (a) without or (b) with Self-Conditioning.\n~x0denotes the estimation of data sample by the denoising network fat a sampling step.

It also raises the question of whether guidance\ncan be performed without a classi\ufb01er. We show that guidance can be indeed\nperformed by a pure generative model without such a classi\ufb01er: in what we\ncall classi\ufb01er-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional\ndiffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score\nestimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that\nobtained using classi\ufb01er guidance.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nDiffusion models have recently emerged as an expressive and \ufb02exible family of generative models,\ndelivering competitive sample quality and likelihood scores on image and audio synthesis tasks (Sohl-\nDickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021b; Kingma et al., 2021;\nSong et al., 2021a).

For this purpose, we use the same model architectures and hyperparameters as\nthe guided diffusion models of Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) (apart from continuous time training as\nspeci\ufb01ed in Section 2); those hyperparameter settings were tuned for classi\ufb01er guidance and hence\nmay be suboptimal for classi\ufb01er-free guidance. Furthermore, since we amortize the conditional and\nunconditional models into the same architecture without an extra classi\ufb01er, we in fact are using less\nmodel capacity than previous work. Nevertheless, our classi\ufb01er-free guided models still produce\ncompetitive sample quality metrics and sometimes outperform prior work, as can be seen in the\nfollowing sections.\n4.1 V ARYING THE CLASSIFIER -FREE GUIDANCE STRENGTH\nHere we experimentally verify the main claim of this paper: that classi\ufb01er-free guidance is able\nto trade off IS and FID in a manner like classi\ufb01er guidance or GAN truncation.

Supporting the ability to generate images based on such descriptions\ncan potentially unlock creative applications in many areas of life, including the arts, design, and\nmultimedia content creation. Recent research on text-to-image generation, e.g., DALL-E [ 2] and\nCogView [ 3], has made signi\ufb01cant progress in generating high-\ufb01delity images and demonstrating\ngeneralization capabilities to unseen combinations of objects and concepts. Both treat the task as a\nform of language modeling, from textual descriptions into visual words, and use modern sequence-\nto-sequence architectures like Transformers [ 4] to learn the relationship between language inputs\nand visual outputs. A key component of these approaches is the conversion of each image into a\nsequence of discrete units through the use of an image tokenizer such as dV AE [ 5] or VQ-V AE [ 6].\nVisual tokenization essentially uni\ufb01es the view of text and images so that both can be treated simply\nas sequences of discrete tokens\u2014and thus amenable to sequence-to-sequence models. To that end,\nDALL-E and CogView employed decoder-only language models, similar to GPT [ 7], to learn from a\nlarge collection of potentially noisy text-image pairs [ 8,9]. Make-A-Scene [ 10] further expands on\nthis two-stage modeling approach to support both text and scene-guided image generation.\nA different line of research with considerable momentum involves diffusion-based text-to-image\nmodels, such as GLIDE [ 11] and concurrent works DALL-E 2 [ 12] (a.k.a ., unCLIP) and Imagen [ 13].\nThese models eschew the use of discrete image tokens in favor of diffusion models [ 14,15] to\ndirectly generate images. These models improve zero-shot Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores\non MS-COCO [ 16] and produce images of markedly higher-quality and greater aesthetic appeal\ncompared to previous work. Even so, autoregressive models for text-to-image generation remain\nappealing given extensive prior work on scaling large language models [ 17,18,19,20] and advances\nin discretizing other modalities\u2013such as images and audio\u2013so that inputs in those modalities can\nbe treated as language-like tokens. This work presents the Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image\n(Parti ) model, which generates high-quality images from text descriptions, including photo-realistic\nones, paintings, drawings, and more (see Fig. 1 & 2). We show that with a ViT-VQGAN [ 21] image\ntokenizer, scaling autoregressive models is an effective way to improve text-to-image generation,\nenabling such models to accurately integrate and visually convey world knowledge.\nParti is a sequence-to-sequence model based on the Transformer [ 4], an architecture critical to perfor-\nmance on many tasks, including machine translation [ 4], speech recognition [ 22,23], conversational\nmodeling [ 24], image captioning [ 25], and many others. Parti takes text tokens as inputs to an encoder\nand autoregressively predicts discrete image tokens with a decoder (see Figure 3).

However, VQGAN [ 13] signi\ufb01cantly improves\nthe perceptual quality of reconstructed images by adding the adversarial and perceptual losses into the\ntraining objective of VQ-V AE. As a generalized approach of VQ-V AE and VQGAN, RQ-V AE [26]\nrepresents an image as a sequence of code stacks, which consists of ordered codes, and reduces the\nsequence length, while preserving the reconstruction quality. Then, RQ-Transformer [ 26] achieves\nhigh performance with lower computational costs on generating high-resolution images. However, as\nan AR model of RQ-V AE, RQ-Transformer cannot capture the global contexts of generated images.\nGeneration Tasks with Bidirectional Transformers To overcome the limitation of AR models\non unidirectional architecture, bidirectional transformers have been used for generative tasks. Similar\nto the pretraining objective of BERT [ 8], a bidirectional transformer is trained to in\ufb01ll a random\nmask. Then, accompanied with an iterative decoding method [ 14,28,34,38], the model can generate\ntexts [ 14], images [ 6], or videos [ 16,40]. Recently, discrete diffusion models [ 1,4,12,15] also\nuses bidirectional transformers to generate an image. Given a partially corrupted by random code\nreplacement [ 1,12] or randomly masked [ 1,4,15] sequence of codes, diffusion models are trained to\ngradually denoise the corrupted codes or in\ufb01ll the masks. The training of discrete diffusion models\nwith an absorbing state [ 1] is the same to in\ufb01ll randomly masked sequence [ 6,4].

We \ufb01rst review RQ-V AE [ 26] as a generalization of VQ-V AE. Then,\nwe propose Contextual RQ-Transformer which is trained to in\ufb01ll a randomly masked sequence of\ncode stacks of RQ-V AE by understanding bidirectional contexts of unmasked parts in the sequence.\nLastly, we propose draft-and-revise decoding for a bidirectional transformer to effectively generate\nhigh-quality images exploiting global contexts of images. Figure 2 provides the overview of our\nproposed framework, including Contextual RQ-Transformer and Draft-and-Revise decoding.\n3.1 Residual-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-V AE)\nRQ-V AE [ 26] represents an image as a sequence of code stacks.

Image generation\nRecent advancements in deep generative models\nhave enabled algorithms to generate high-quality and\nnatural-looking images. Generative Adversarial Net-\nworks (GANs) [17] facilitate the generation of high \ufb01delity\nimages [29, 3, 30, 56] in multiple domains by simultane-\nously training a generator network Gand a discriminator\nnetworkD, whereGis trained to fool D, whileDis trained\nto judge if a given image is real or fake. Concurrently to\nGANs, Variational Autoencoders (V AEs) [32, 57] have in-\ntroduced a likelihood-based approach to image generation.\nOther likelihood-based models include autoregressive mod-\nels [58, 43, 13, 8] and diffusion models [11, 21, 20]. While\nthe former model image pixels as a sequence with autore-\ngressive dependency between each pixel, the latter synthe-\nsizes images via a gradual denoising process. Speci\ufb01cally,\nsampling starts with a noisy image which is iteratively de-\nnoised until all denoising steps are performed. Applying\nboth appendix.\n3.1. Scene representation and tokenization\nThe scene is composed of a union of three complemen-\ntary semantic segmentation groups - panoptic, human, and\nface. By combining the three extracted semantic segmen-\ntation groups, the network learns to both generate the se-\nmantic layout and condition on it while generating the \ufb01nal\nimage. The semantic layout provides additional global con-\ntext in an implicit form that correlates with human prefer-\nence, as the choice of categories within the scene groups,\nand the choice of the groups themselves are a prior to hu-\nman preference and awareness. We consider this form of\nconditioning to be implicit, as the network may disregard\nany scene information, and generate the image conditioned\nsolely on text.

That is, AR models can generate high-resolution\nimages without predicting whole pixels in an image.\nWe postulate that reducing the sequence length of codes\nis important for AR modeling of images. A short sequence\nof codes can signi\ufb01cantly reduce the computational costs\nof an AR model, since an AR uses the codes in previous\npositions to predict the next code. However, previous stud-\nies have a limitation to reducing the sequence length of im-\nages in terms of the rate-distortion trade-off [42]. Namely,\nVQ-V AE [45] requires an exponentially increasing size of\n1arXiv:2203.01941v2  [cs.CV]  9 Mar 2022codebook to reduce the resolution of the quantized feature\nmap, while conserving the quality of reconstructed images.\nHowever, a huge codebook leads to the increase of model\nparameters and the codebook collapse problem [10], which\nmakes the training of VQ-V AE unstable.\nIn this study, we propose a Residual-Quantized VAE\n(RQ-VAE) , which uses a residual quantization (RQ) to pre-\ncisely approximate the feature map and reduce its spatial\nresolution. Instead of increasing the codebook size, RQ\nuses a \ufb01xed size of codebook to recursively quantize the\nfeature map in a coarse-to-\ufb01ne manner. After Diterations\nof RQ, the feature map is represented as a stacked map of\nDdiscrete codes. Since RQ can compose as many vectors\nas the codebook size to the power of D, RQ-V AE can pre-\ncisely approximate a feature map, while conserving the in-\nformation of the encoded image without a huge codebook.\nThanks to the precise approximation, RQ-V AE can further\nreduce the spatial resolution of the quantized feature map\nthan previous studies [14, 37, 45]. For example, our RQ-\nV AE can use 8\u00028 resolution of feature maps for AR mod-\neling of 256\u0002256 images.\nIn addition, We propose RQ-Transformer to predict\nthe codes extracted by RQ-V AE. For the input of RQ-\nTransformer, the quantized feature map in RQ-V AE is con-\nverted into a sequence of feature vectors. Then, RQ-\nTransformer predicts the next Dcodes to estimate the fea-\nture vector at the next position. Thanks to the reduced res-\nolution of feature maps by RQ-V AE, RQ-Transformer can\nsigni\ufb01cantly reduce the computational costs and easily learn\nthe long-range interactions of inputs. We also propose two\ntraining techniques for RQ-Transformer, soft labeling and\nstochastic sampling for the codes of RQ-V AE. They further\nimprove the performance of RQ-Transformer by resolving\nthe exposure bias [38] in the training of AR models. Con-\nsequently, as shown in Figure 1, our model can generate\nhigh-quality images.\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows.\n1) We propose RQ-V AE, which represents an image\nas", " Introduction\nDeep image synthesis as a \ufb01eld has seen a lot of progress\nin recent years.

Espe-\ncially high-resolution synthesis of complex, natural scenes\nis presently dominated by scaling up likelihood-based mod-\nels, potentially containing billions of parameters in autore-\ngressive (AR) transformers [66,67]. In contrast, the promis-\ning Related Work\nGenerative Models for Image Synthesis The high di-\nmensional nature of images presents distinct challenges\nto generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) [27] allow for ef\ufb01cient sampling of high resolution\nimages with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are dif\ufb01-\n2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full\ndata distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth-\nods emphasize good density estimation which renders op-\ntimization more well-behaved. Variational autoencoders\n(V AE) [46] and \ufb02ow-based models [18, 19] enable ef\ufb01cient\nsynthesis of high resolution images [9, 44, 92], but sam-\nple quality is not on par with GANs. While autoregressive\nmodels (ARM) [6, 10, 94, 95] achieve strong performance\nin density estimation, computationally demanding architec-\ntures [97] and a sequential sampling process limit them to\nlow resolution images. Because pixel based representations\nof images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency de-\ntails [16,73], maximum-likelihood training spends a dispro-\nportionate amount of capacity on modeling them, resulting\nin long training times. To scale to higher resolutions, several\ntwo-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model\na compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels.\nRecently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82],\nhave achieved state-of-the-art methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(zjx) =\nN(z;E\u0016;E\u001b2)and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0;1)as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu-\nlarizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of jZjdifferent exemplars [96].\nTo obtain high-\ufb01delity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the\nKLterm by a factor\u001810\u00006or choose a high codebook dimensionality jZj.\nThe full objective to train the autoencoding model (E;D)reads:\nLAutoencoder = min\nE;Dmax\n \u0010\nLrec(x;D(E(x)))\u0000Ladv(D(E(x))) + logD (x) +Lreg(x;E;D)\u0011\n(25)\nDM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two\ncases when learning p(z)orp(zjy)(Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we sample z=E\u0016(x)+E\u001b(x)\u0001\"=:E(x),\nwhere\"\u0018N(0;1). When rescaling the latent, we estimate the component-wise variance\n^\u001b2=1\nbchwX\nb;c;h;w(zb;c;h;w\u0000^\u0016)2\nfrom the \ufb01rst batch in the data, where ^\u0016=1\nbchwP\nb;c;h;wzb;c;h;w. The output ofEis scaled such that the rescaled latent has\nunit standard deviation, i.e.z z\n^\u001b=E(x)\n^\u001b. (ii) For a VQ-regularized latent space, we extract zbefore the quantization layer\nand absorb the quantization operation into the decoder, i.e. it can be interpreted as the \ufb01rst layer of D.\nH. Additional Qualitative Experiments\nLDMs provide means to \ufb02exible and computationally\ntractable diffusion based image synthesis of various image\nmodalities, which we empirically show in the following.\nFirstly, however, we analyze the gains of our models com-\npared to pixel-based diffusion models in both training and\ninference. Interestingly, we \ufb01nd that LDMs trained in VQ-\nregularized latent spaces sometimes achieve better sample\nquality, even though the reconstruction capabilities of VQ-\nregularized \ufb01rst stage models slightly fall behind those of\ntheir continuous counterparts, cf.

The discrete image tokens are encoded from a learned Vision-Transformer-\nbased VQGAN ( ViT-VQGAN ).

VIM-L also outperforms\niGPT-XL which is trained with extra web image data and larger model size.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural language processing (NLP) has recently experienced dramatic improvements from learning\ngeneral-purpose representations by pretraining language models on unlabeled text corpora. This\nstrategy has produced large performance gains for a wide range of natural language generation\n(NLG) and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks (Dai & Le, 2015; Radford et al., 2018;\n2019; Brown et al., 2020). Conceptually, generative pretraining models the data density P(X)in a\ntractable way, with the hope of also helping discriminative tasks of P(YjX)(Lasserre et al., 2006);\nimportantly, there are no limitations on whether the signals are from the language domain or others,\nsuch as vision.\nIn computer vision, in contrast, most recent unsupervised or self-supervised learning research fo-\ncuses on applying different random augmentations to images, with the pretraining objective to dis-\ntinguish image instances (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020d; Grill et al., 2020;\nChen et al., 2020c; Caron et al., 2021). The quality of learned representation relies on manually cho-\nsen augmentations, such as random brightness, cropping, blurring, and others. Chen et al. (2020a)\nexplored GPT-style (Radford et al., 2018) generative pretraining on images by autoregressively pre-\ndicting pixels without incorporating knowledge of the 2D structure. Each pixel is represented as a\n9-bit value created by clustering (R, G, B) pixel values, using k-means with k=512. Unfortunately,\nthis color encoding does not scale to typical image resolutions as it entails very long sequences to\nrepresent the image ( e.g.,224\u0002224resolution leads to 50;176tokens per image), and this demands\nmuch more memory and computation for training, compared to language models.

These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text\nprompts [ 72,50] or learning useful feature representations [ 14,7]. While these models are already\n\u0003Equal contributionarXiv:2105.05233v4  [cs.LG]  1 Jun 2021capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond\nthe current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic\ndesign, games, music production, and countless other \ufb01elds.\nGANs [ 19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [ 5,68,28] as measured\nby sample quality metrics such as FID [ 23], Inception Score [ 54] and Precision [ 32]. However, some\nof these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity\nthan state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [ 51,43,42]. Furthermore, GANs are often dif\ufb01cult to\ntrain, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4].\nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them dif\ufb01cult to scale and apply to\nnew domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with\nlikelihood-based models [ 51,25,42,9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically\neasier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore,\nexcept for V AEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time.\nDiffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models which have recently been shown to produce\nhigh-quality images [ 56,59,25] while offering desirable properties such as distribution coverage,\na stationary training objective, and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually\nremoving noise from a signal, and their training objective can be expressed as a reweighted variational\nlower-bound [ 25]. This class of models already holds the state-of-the-art [ 60] on CIFAR-10 [ 31], but\nstill lags behind GANs on dif\ufb01cult generation datasets like LSUN and ImageNet. Nichol and Dhariwal\n[43] found that these models improve reliably with increased compute, and can produce high-quality\nsamples even on the dif\ufb01cult ImageNet 256 \u0002256 dataset using an upsampling stack. However, the\nFID of this model is still not competitive with BigGAN-deep [5], the current state-of-the-art on this\ndataset.\nWe hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors:\n\ufb01rst, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and\nre\ufb01ned; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for \ufb01delity, producing high quality samples\nbut not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these bene\ufb01ts to diffusion models, \ufb01rst by\nimproving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for \ufb01delity.\nWith these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different\nmetrics and datasets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion\nmodels based on Ho et al. [ 25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [ 43] and Song\net al. [ 57], and", " Introduction\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) [2, 7, 14, 47]\nhave made signi\ufb01cant progress in recent years on synthesiz-\ning high-\ufb01delity images. The GAN models are the corner-\nstone techniques for numerous vision applications, such as\ndata augmentation [12, 13], domain adaptation [19, 20], im-\nage extrapolation [10, 66], image-to-image translation [22,\n37, 86], and visual content creation [1, 4, 21, 23, 70, 72].\nThe success of the GAN results in Figure 11.\n16 experiments.\nNecessity of exponential moving averages (EMAs). We validate the necessity of the EMAs in the table below with the\nBigGAN model on the 20% CIFAR datasets.

The Related Work\nGenerative adversarial networks. Generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) [2, 7, 14, 27, 32, 47, 79] aim to model\nthe target distribution using adversarial learning. Various\nadversarial losses have been proposed to stabilize the train-\ning or improve the convergence of the GAN models, mainly\nbased on the idea of minimizing the f-divergence between\nthe real and generated data distributions [55]. For exam-\nple, Goodfellow et al. [14] propose the saturated loss that\nminimizes the JS-divergence between the two distributions.\nSimilarly, the LSGAN [47] formulation leads to minimizing\nthe\u001f2-divergence [56], and the EBGAN [81] approach op-\ntimizes the total variation distance [2]. On the other hand,some models are designed to minimize the integral proba-\nbility metrics (IPM) [52, 64], such as the WGAN [2, 15]\nframeworks. In this work, we design a new regularization\nscheme that can be applied to different GAN loss functions\nfor training the GAN models on the limited data.\nLearning GANs on limited training data. With the ob-\njective of reducing the data collection effort, several stud-\nies [16, 76] raise the concern of insuf\ufb01cient data for train-\ning the GAN models. Training the GAN models on lim-\nited data is challenging because the data scarcity leads to\nthe problems such as unstable training dynamics, degraded\n\ufb01delity of the generated images, and memorization of the\ntraining examples. To address these issues, recent meth-\nods [30, 68, 80, 82, 83, 84] exploit data augmentation as a\nmean to increase data diversity, hence preventing the GAN\nmodels from over\ufb01tting the training data. For example,\nZhang et al. [80] augment the real images and introduce a\nconsistency loss for training the discriminator. The DA [82]\nand ADA [30] approaches share a similar idea of applying\ndifferential data augmentation on both real and generated\nimages, in which ADA further develops an adaptive strat-\negy to adjust the probability of augmentation. In contrast\nto prior work, we tackle this problem from a different per-\nspective of model regularization . We show that our method\nis conceptually and empirically complementary to the exist-\ning data augmentation approaches.\nRegularization for GANs.

In contrast to the predominant vi-\nsion architecture, convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nthe transformer architecture contains no built-in inductive\nprior on the locality of interactions and is therefore free\nto learn complex relationships among its inputs. However,\nthis generality also implies that it has to learn all relation-\nships, whereas CNNs have been designed to exploit prior\nknowledge about strong local correlations within images.\nThus, the increased expressivity of transformers comes with\nquadratically increasing computational costs, because all\npairwise interactions are taken into account. The result-\ning energy and time requirements of state-of-the-art trans-\nformer models thus pose fundamental problems for scaling\nthem to high-resolution images with millions of pixels.\nObservations that transformers tend to learn convolu-\ntional structures [16] thus beg the question: Do we have\nto re-learn everything we know about the local structure\nand regularity of images from scratch each time we train\na vision model, or can we ef\ufb01ciently encode inductive im-\nage biases while still retaining the \ufb02exibility of transform-\ners? We hypothesize that low-level image structure is well\ndescribed by a local connectivity, i.e. a convolutional ar-\nchitecture, whereas this structural assumption ceases to be\neffective on higher semantic levels. Moreover, CNNs not\nonly exhibit a strong locality bias, but also a bias towards\nspatial invariance through the use of shared weights across\n1arXiv:2012.09841v3  [cs.CV]  23 Jun 2021all positions. This makes them ineffective if a more holistic\nunderstanding of the input is required.\nOur key insight to obtain an effective and expressive\nmodel is that, taken together, convolutional and transformer\narchitectures can model the compositional nature of our vi-\nsual world [51] : We use a convolutional approach to ef\ufb01-\nciently learn a codebook of context-rich visual parts and,\nsubsequently, learn a model of their global compositions.\nThe long-range interactions within these compositions re-\nquire an expressive transformer architecture to model distri-\nbutions over their consituent visual parts. Furthermore, we\nutilize an adversarial approach to ensure that the dictionary\nof local parts captures perceptually important local struc-\nture to alleviate the need for modeling low-level statistics\nwith the transformer architecture. Allowing transformers to\nconcentrate on their unique strength\u2014modeling long-range\nrelations\u2014enables them to generate high-resolution images\nas in Fig. 1, a feat which previously has been out of reach.\nOur formulationgives control over the generated images by\nmeans of conditioning information regarding desired object\nclasses or spatial layouts. Finally, experiments\nis described in Tab. 7. Note that we adopt the compression rate by tuning the number of downsampling steps m. Further note\nthat\u0015in Eq. 5 is set to zero in an initial warm-up phase. Empirically, we found that longer warm-ups generally lead to better\nreconstructions. As a rule of thumb, we recommend setting \u0015= 0for at least one epoch.\nTransformer Architecture Our transformer model is identical to the GPT2 architecture [58] and we vary its capacity\nmainly through varying the amount of layers (see Tab. 8).

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details).

BN normalizes the features by the mean\nand variance computed within a (mini-)batch. This has been\nshown by many practices to ease optimization and enable\nvery deep networks to converge. The stochastic uncertainty\nof the batch statistics also acts as a regularizer that can ben-\ne\ufb01t generalization. BN has been a foundation of many state-\nof-the-art computer vision algorithms.\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/\nblob/master/projects/GN .\n2 4 8 16 32\nbatch size (images per worker)2224262830323436error (%)Batch Norm\nGroup NormFigure 1. ImageNet classi\ufb01cation error vs. batch sizes . This is\na ResNet-50 model trained in the ImageNet training set using 8\nworkers (GPUs), evaluated in the validation set.\nDespite its great success, BN exhibits drawbacks that are\nalso caused by its distinct behavior of normalizing along\nthe batch dimension. In particular, it is required for BN\nto work with a suf\ufb01ciently large batch size (e.g., 32 per\nworker2[26, 59, 20]). A small batch leads to inaccurate\nestimation of the batch statistics, and reducing BN\u2019s batch\nsize increases the model error dramatically (Figure 1). As\na result, many recent models [59, 20, 57, 24, 63] are trained\nwith non-trivial batch sizes that are memory-consuming.\nThe heavy reliance on BN\u2019s effectiveness to train models in\nturn prohibits people from exploring higher-capacity mod-\nels that would be limited by memory.\nThe restriction on batch sizes is more demanding in com-\nputer vision tasks including detection [12, 47, 18], segmen-\ntation [38, 18], video recognition [60, 6], and other high-\nlevel systems built on them. For example, the Fast/er and\nMask R-CNN frameworks [12, 47, 18] use a batch size of\n1 or 2 images because of higher resolution, where BN is\n\u201cfrozen\u201d by transforming to a linear layer [20]; in video\nclassi\ufb01cation with 3D convolutions [60, 6], the presence of\nspatial-temporal features introduces a trade-off between the\ntemporal length and batch size. The usage of BN often re-\nquires these systems to compromise between the model de-\nsign and batch sizes.\n2In the context of this paper, we use \u201cbatch size\u201d to refer to the number\nof samples per worker (e.g., GPU). BN\u2019s statistics are computed for each\nworker, but notbroadcast across workers, as is standard in many libraries.\n1arXiv:1803.08494v3  [cs.CV]  11 Jun 2018This paper presents Group Normalization (GN) as a sim-\nple alternative to BN. We notice that many classical features\nlike SIFT [39] and HOG [9] are group-wise features and in-\nvolve group-wise normalization . For example, a HOG vec-\ntor is the outcome of several spatial cells where each cell is\nrepresented by a normalized orientation histogram. Analo-\ngously, we propose GN as a layer that divides channels into\ngroups and normalizes the features within each group (Fig-\nure 2). GN does not exploit the batch dimension, and its\ncomputation is independent of batch sizes.\nGN behaves very stably over a wide range of batch sizes\n(Figure 1). With a batch size of 2 samples, GN has 10.6%\nlower error than its BN counterpart for ResNet-50 [20] in\nImageNet [50]. With a regular batch size, GN is comparably\ngood as BN (with a gap of \u00180.5%) and outperforms other\nnormalization variants [3, 61, 51]. Moreover, although the\nbatch size may change, GN can naturally transfer from pre-\ntraining to \ufb01ne-tuning. GN shows improved", "Abstract\nWhile it is nearly effortless for humans to quickly assess\nthe perceptual similarity between two images, the under-\nlying processes are thought to be quite complex. Despite\nthis, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such\nas PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail\nto account for many nuances of human perception. Re-\ncently, the deep learning community has found that features\nof the VGG network trained on ImageNet classi\ufb01cation has\nbeen remarkably useful as a training loss for image syn-\nthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \u201cpercep-\ntual losses\u201d? What elements are critical for their success?\nTo answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of\nhuman perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically\nevaluate deep features across different architectures and\ntasks and compare them with classic metrics. We \ufb01nd that\ndeep features outperform all previous metrics by large mar-\ngins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not re-\nstricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across\ndifferent deep architectures and levels of supervision (su-\npervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our re-\nsults suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent prop-\nerty shared across deep visual representations.\n1. Motivation\nThe ability to compare data items is perhaps the most\nfundamental operation underlying all of computing. Inmany areas of computer science it does not pose much dif-\n\ufb01culty: one can use Hamming distance to compare binary\npatterns, edit distance to compare text \ufb01les, Euclidean dis-\ntance to compare vectors, etc. The unique challenge of com-\nputer vision is that even this seemingly simple task of com-\nparing visual patterns remains a wide-open problem. Not\nonly are visual patterns very high-dimensional and highly\ncorrelated, but, the very notion of visual similarity is often\nsubjective, aiming to mimic human visual perception. For\ninstance, in image compression, the goal is for the com-\npressed image to be indistinguishable from the original by\na human observer, irrespective of the fact that their pixel\nrepresentations might be very different.\nClassic per-pixel measures, such as `2Euclidean dis-\ntance, commonly used for regression problems, or the re-\nlated Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), are insuf\ufb01cient\nfor assessing structured outputs such as images, as they as-\nsume pixel-wise independence. A well-known example is\nthat blurring causes large perceptual but small `2change.\nWhat we would really like is a \u201cperceptual distance,\u201d\nwhich measures how similar are two images in a way\nthat coincides with human judgment. This problem has\nbeen a longstanding goal, and there have been numerous\nperceptually motivated distance metrics proposed, such as\nSSIM [58], MSSIM [60], FSIM [62], and HDR-VDP [34].\nHowever, constructing a perceptual metric is challeng-\ning, because human judgments of similarity (1) depend on\nhigh-order image structure [58], (2) are context-dependent\n1arXiv:1801.03924v2  [cs.CV]  10 Apr 2018OriginalPerturbed Patches\n(a)Traditional\nOriginalPerturbed Patches (b)CNN-based\nFigure 2: Example distortions.

At the same time, challenging\ntasks such as few-shot learning [ 34], domain adaptation [ 17], or reinforcement learning [ 35] heavily\nrely on learnt representations from raw data, but the usefulness of generic representations trained in\nan unsupervised fashion is still far from being the dominant approach.\nMaximum likelihood and reconstruction error are two common objectives used to train unsupervised\nmodels in the pixel domain, however their usefulness depends on the particular application the\nfeatures are used in. Our goal is to achieve a model that conserves the important features of the\ndata in its latent space while optimising for maximum likelihood. As the work in [ 7] suggests, the\nbest generative models (as measured by log-likelihood) will be those without latents but a powerful\ndecoder (such as PixelCNN). However, in this paper, we argue for learning discrete and useful latent\nvariables, which we demonstrate on a variety of domains.\nLearning representations with continuous features have been the focus of many previous work\n[16,39,6,9] however we concentrate on discrete representations [ 27,33,8,28] which are potentially\na more natural \ufb01t for many of the modalities we are interested in. Language is inherently discrete,\nsimilarly speech is typically represented as a sequence of symbols. Images can often be described\nconcisely by language [ 40]. Furthermore, discrete representations are a natural \ufb01t for complex\nreasoning, planning and predictive learning (e.g., if it rains, I will use an umbrella). While using\ndiscrete latent variables in deep learning has proven challenging, powerful autoregressive models\nhave been developed for modelling distributions over discrete variables [37].\nIn our work, we introduce a new family of generative models succesfully combining the variational\nautoencoder (V AE) framework with discrete latent representations through a novel parameterisation\nof the posterior distribution of (discrete) latents given an observation. Our model, which relies on\nvector quantization (VQ), is simple to train, does not suffer from large variance, and avoids the\n31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.arXiv:1711.00937v2  [cs.LG]  30 May 2018\u201cposterior collapse\u201d issue which has been problematic with many V AE models that have a powerful\ndecoder, often caused by latents being ignored. Additionally, it is the \ufb01rst discrete latent V AE model\nthat get similar performance as its continuous counterparts, while offering the \ufb02exibility of discrete\ndistributions. We term our model the VQ-V AE.\nSince VQ-V AE can make effective use of the latent space, it can successfully model important\nfeatures that usually span many dimensions in data space (for example objects span many pixels in\nimages, phonemes in speech, the message in a text fragment, etc.) as opposed to focusing or spending\ncapacity on noise and imperceptible details which are often local.\nLastly, once a good discrete latent structure of a modality is discovered by the VQ-V AE, we train\na powerful prior over these discrete random variables, yielding interesting samples and useful\napplications. For instance, when trained on speech we discover the latent structure of language\nwithout any supervision or prior knowledge about phonemes or words. Furthermore, we can equip\nour decoder with the speaker identity, which allows for speaker conversion, i.e., transferring the\nvoice from", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript\u210e\ud835\udc61h_{t}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121subscript\u210e\ud835\udc611h_{t-1}italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the input for position t\ud835\udc61titalic_t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n \n\n2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\u00a03.2.\n\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned", "ABSTRACT\nRestart techniques are common in gradient-free optimization to deal with multi-\nmodal functions.

Thus,\nthis dataset is substantially", " Introduction\nGenerative adversarial networks [1] (GANs) are a class of Related work\nSeveral recent papers focus on improving the stability of training and the resulting perceptual quality\nof GAN samples [2, 3, 5, 6]. We build on some of these techniques in this work. For instance, we\nuse some of the \u201cDCGAN\u201d architectural innovations proposed in Radford et al. [3], as discussed\nbelow.\nOne of our proposed techniques, feature matching , discussed in Sec. 3.1, is similar in spirit to\napproaches that use maximum mean discrepancy [7, 8, 9] to train generator networks [10, 11].\nAnother of our proposed techniques, minibatch features , is based in part on ideas used for batch\nnormalization [12], while our proposed virtual batch normalization is a direct extension of batch\nnormalization.\nOne of the primary goals of this work is to improve the effectiveness of generative adversarial\nnetworks for semi-supervised learning (improving the performance of a supervised task, in this case,\nclassi\ufb01cation, by learning on additional unlabeled examples). Like many deep generative models,\nGANs have previously been applied to semi-supervised learning [13, 14], and our work can be seen\nas a continuation and re\ufb01nement of this effort.\n3 Toward Convergent GAN Training\nTraining GANs consists in \ufb01nding a Nash equilibrium to a two-player non-cooperative game.\nEach player wishes to minimize its own cost function, J(D)(\u0012(D);\u0012(G))for the discriminator and\nJ(G)(\u0012(D);\u0012(G))for the generator. A Nash equilibirum is a point (\u0012(D);\u0012(G))such thatJ(D)is at a\nminimum with respect to \u0012(D)andJ(G)is at a minimum with respect to \u0012(G). Unfortunately, \ufb01nd-\ning Nash equilibria is a very dif\ufb01cult problem. Algorithms exist for specialized cases, but we are not\naware of any that are feasible to apply to the GAN game, where the cost functions are non-convex,\nthe parameters are continuous, and the parameter space is extremely high-dimensional.\nThe idea that a Nash equilibrium occurs when each player has minimal cost seems to intuitively mo-\ntivate the idea of using traditional gradient-based minimization techniques to minimize each player\u2019s\ncost simultaneously. Unfortunately, a modi\ufb01cation to \u0012(D)that reduces J(D)can increase J(G), and\na modi\ufb01cation to \u0012(G)that reduces J(G)can increase J(D). Gradient descent thus fails to converge\nfor many games. For example, when one player minimizes xywith respect to xand another player\nminimizes\u0000xywith respect to y, gradient descent enters a stable orbit, rather than converging to\nx=y= 0, the desired equilibrium point [15]. Previous approaches to GAN training have thus\napplied gradient descent on each player\u2019s cost simultaneously, despite the lack of guarantee that this\nprocedure will converge. We introduce the following techniques that are heuristically motivated to\nencourage convergence:\n3.1 Feature matching\nFeature matching addresses the instability of GANs by specifying a new objective for the generator\nthat prevents it from overtraining on the current discriminator. Instead of directly maximizing the\noutput of the discriminator, the new objective requires the generator to generate data that matches\nthe statistics of the real data, where we use the discriminator only to specify the statistics that we\nthink are worth matching. Speci\ufb01cally, we train the generator to match the expected value of the\nfeatures on an intermediate layer of the discriminator. This is a natural choice of statistics for the\ngenerator to match, since by training the discriminator we ask it to \ufb01nd those features that are most\ndiscriminative of real data versus data generated by the current model.\nLetting", " Introduction\nMany classic problems can be framed as image transformation tasks, where a\nsystem receives some input image and transforms it into an output image. Exam-\nples from image processing include denoising, super-resolution, and colorization,\nwhere the input is a degraded image (noisy, low-resolution, or grayscale) and the\noutput is a high-quality color image. Examples from computer vision include se-\nmantic segmentation and depth estimation, where the input is a color image and\nthe output image encodes semantic or geometric information about the scene.\nOne approach for solving image transformation tasks is to train a feed-\nforward convolutional neural network in a supervised manner, using a per-pixel\nloss function to measure the di\u000berence between output and ground-truth images.\nThis approach has been used for example by Dong et al for super-resolution [1],\nby Cheng et al for colorization [2], by Long et al for segmentation [3], and by\nEigen et al for depth and surface normal prediction [4,5]. Such approaches are\ne\u000ecient at test-time, requiring only a forward pass through the trained network.\nHowever, the per-pixel losses used by these Related Work\nFeed-forward image transformation. In recent years, a wide variety of feed-\nforward image transformation tasks have been solved by training deep convolu-\ntional neural networks with per-pixel loss functions.\nSemantic segmentation experiments is not to achieve state-of-the-art PSNR or SSIM Experiments\nWe perform Results for\u00028 super-resolution are shown in Figure 9. Again we see that our\n`featmodel does a good job at edges and \fne details compared to other models,\nsuch as the horse's legs and hooves. The `featmodel does not sharpen edges\nindiscriminately; compared to the `pixel model, the `featmodel sharpens the\nboundary edges of the horse and rider but the background trees remain di\u000buse,\nsuggesting that the `featmodel may be more aware of image semantics.\nSince our`pixel and our`featmodels share the same architecture, data, and\ntraining procedure, all di\u000berences between them are due to the di\u000berence between\nthe`pixel and`featlosses. The `pixel loss gives fewer visual artifacts and higher\nPSNR values but the `featloss does a better job at reconstructing \fne details,\nleading to pleasing visual Conclusion\nIn this paper we have combined the bene\fts of feed-forward image transfor-\nmation tasks and optimization-based References\n1.

Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high-\nlevel features [50] and classi\ufb01ers in an end-to-end multi-\nlayer fashion, and the \u201clevels\u201d of features can be enriched\nby the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence\n[41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance,\nand the leading results (Table 14), showing a 64%\nrelative reduction of error. This result won the 1st place in\nthe ImageNet localization task in ILSVRC 2015.\n12 experiments trained\non the training set and evaluated on the test set. Our focus\nis on the behaviors of extremely deep networks, but not on\npushing the state-of-the-art Related Work\nResidual Representations. In image recognition, VLAD\n[18] is a representation that encodes by the residual vectors\nwith respect to a dictionary, and Fisher Vector [30] can be\nformulated as a probabilistic version [18] of VLAD. Both\nof them are powerful shallow representations for image re-\ntrieval and classi\ufb01cation [4, 48]. For vector quantization,\nencoding residual vectors [17] is shown to be more effec-\ntive than encoding original vectors.\nIn low-level vision and computer graphics, for solv-\ning Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the widely used\nMultigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subprob-\nlems at multiple scales, where each subproblem is respon-\nsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a \ufb01ner\nscale. An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis pre-\nconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that repre-\nsent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown\n[3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than stan-\ndard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the\nsolutions. These methods.\nports a center-crop error of 33.1% (Table 13) using ground\ntruth classes.

The degradation problem suggests that the solvers\nmight have dif\ufb01culties in approximating identity mappings\nby multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning re-\nformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers\nmay simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear lay-\ners toward zero to approach identity mappings.\nIn real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are op-\ntimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the\nproblem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity\nmapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the\nsolver to \ufb01nd the perturbations with reference to an identity\nmapping, than to learn the function as a new one.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28]. However, the encoder", " INTRODUCTION\nAnomalous sound detection (ASD) [1\u20137] is the task of identify-\ning whether the sound emitted from a target machine is normal or\nanomalous. Automatic detection of mechanical failure is essential\nfor the artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013based factory automation. Use of\nmachine sounds for promptly detecting machine anomalies is useful\nfor monitoring a machine\u2019s condition.\nOne fundamental challenge regarding the application of ASD\nsystems is that anomalous samples for training can be insufficient\nboth in number and type. In 2020, we organized the first ASD\ntask in Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Event\n(DCASE) Challenge 2020 Task 2 [8]; \u201c unsupervised ASD \u201d that was\nintended to detect unknown anomalous sounds using only normal\nsound samples as the training data [1\u20137].\nFor the wide-spread application of ASD systems, advanced\ntasks such as handling of domain shifts should be tackled [9]. Do-\nmain shifts are differences between the source and target domaindata caused by a machine\u2019s operational conditions or environmen-\ntal noise. Since results of top 10 teams in the ranking.

Oversampling for imbalance compensation\nBecause the number of samples in the datasets is imbalanced\nacross domains and attributes, compensating for these class imbal-\nances can improve the detection performance. The 6th team [14]\nduplicated samples from classes with fewer samples, while the\n1st and 2nd teams [15, 16] oversampled target-domain data using\nSMOTE [17]. These approaches are only seen among top-rankers,\nand can be one of the key factors for outperforming the baselines.\nb. Synthetic data generation for robust detection\nSynthetic data can be utilized to accurately model the dis-\ntribution of normal data and enhance the robustness of the\ndetection model. The 1st, 4th, 5th, 10th, and 19th teams employed\nMixup [18] including its variants [15, 19\u201322], and obtained higher\nsource-domain AUCs. Other papers used other data augmentationtechniques such as speed perturbation, noise injection, and pitch\nshift [14, 16, 23]. The treatment of generated synthetic data varies\namong teams. While the 4th team [19] treated them as anomalous\nsamples that belong to a new class, the 1st and 5th teams [15, 20]\ntreated them as normal samples. Mixup can be one of the key fac-\ntors for outperforming the baselines, as this technique was used by\nseveral top-rankers and teams that achieved higher source-domain\nAUCs.\nc.

For the outlier detector, k-\nnearest neighbors algorithm (kNN) was used by most of the teams.\nPre-trained models are used [16, 24, 26] for attribute classi-\nfiers or machine type classifiers.

It has the potential in acoustic scene mon-\nitoring [3], quality assurance [8], and arti\ufb01cial intelligence-\nbased factory automation [5]. Due to the unavailability of\nanomalous sounds, the audio feature acquisition and repre-\nsentation of normal sounds is key to distinguishing the normal\nand unknown anomalous sounds [9, 10].\nTo learn the audio representation, early EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n3.1. Experimental Setup\nDataset Following [9], our CLP-SCF method is evaluated on\nthe DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 development and addi-\ntional datasets, which include four machine types (i.e., Fan,Pump, Slider and Valve) from the MIMII dataset [16] and\ntwo machine types (i.e., ToyCar and ToyConveyor) from the\nToyADMOS dataset [17]. Each machine type has seven dif-\nferent machines, except for ToyConveyor, which only has six\ndifferent machines. Therefore, we have audio signals from\n41 different machines (41 ID labels), where each audio signal\nis around 10 seconds. The training data of the development\ndataset and the additional dataset are combined as the training\nset, and our model is trained for all machine IDs. The normal\nand anomalous sound from the test data of the development\ndataset is adopted for model evaluation.\nNote that in our experiments.\nImplementation Details In the pretraining stage, we ran-\ndomly select 6 machine sounds from each ID to construct the\nset of input audio signals with the batch size of 246 ( 41\u00026),\nwhich is used to build the contrast for the signals from all ID\nlabels. Adam optimizer [18] with a learning rate of 0.0005 is\nused for model optimization, and the model is pretrained with\n100 epochs. The temperature score \u001cin Eq. (2) is empirically\nselected as 0.05 following [12].\nIn the \ufb01ne-tuning stage, the batch size is converted to 128,\nthe learning rate is set as 0.0001, and our model is \ufb01ne-tuned\nwith 300 epochs. For the self-supervised classi\ufb01cation, the\nmargin and scale hyper-parameters of the ArcFace loss are\nset as 1.0 and 30, respectively. Note that, the cosine annealing\nstrategy is adopted as the learning rate decay schedule in both\nstages [19].\nPerformance Metrics Following [1\u20134,9], we employ the area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and\nthe partial-AUC (pAUC) for performance evaluation. Here,\npAUC denotes the AUC value over a low false-positive rate\nrange [0;p], wherepis set as 0.1 following [1,9]. Meanwhile,\nminimum AUC (mAUC) is also adopted for detection stability\nevaluation, which re\ufb02ects the worst detection performance of\nthe machines from the same machine type [4, 9].\n3.2.

Recent years saw more and more effort\ndevoted to anomaly detection via image or sensor signal.\nHowever, audio-based anomaly detection remains challeng-\ning for both conventional models and deep learning based\nmodels. There are the following dif\ufb01culties to be overcome:\n(1)Paradox in feature representation: non-intuitive or\nhigh dimensional. It is well-known that audio car-\nries message in a time-frequency coupling form, whose\nraw waveform does even make sense for humans. To\npresent it in an intuitive form, spectrogram is calcu-\nlated on the time series, yielding a high dimensional\n*Corresponding Author\nThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Develop-\nment Program of China (Grant NO.2021YFA1000504) and the National Nat-\nural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 62276153.representation which exceeds the detection capacity of\nconventional algorithms, including k-nearest neighbor\n(KNN) [1] and local outlier factor (LOF) [2].\n(2)Indirect and Unreliable Supervision. Deep learning\nhas demonstrated its capability of handling high dimen-\nsional input in the past few years. However, concerning\nanomaly detection, challenges remain since deep learn-\ning based models must learn to dig out hidden patterns\nthrough the enormous input without direct supervision.\nClassi\ufb01cation model [3], averts this restriction by train-\ning on auxiliary labels, yet there is no guarantee that\nthis yields a good feature extractor.\n(3)Variational Working Conditions. The variation of\nworking conditions leads to distinct feature represen-\ntation, making it harder for models to identify between\nanomalous clips and normal clips from rare working\nconditions, especially when similar patches can be seen\nin both normal and anomalous distributions.\nConsidering these problems, GAN [4] may be a potential\nbreakthrough for audio anomaly detection, not only because\nit can be trained without utilizing auxiliary labels, but also\nbecause of its great potential of learning huge manifold and\ngeneralizing on multiple domains. Recent advances has man-\nifested GAN\u2019s effectiveness on image anomaly detection, in-\ncluding AnoGAN [5] which searches the optimal latent vari-\nable and GANomaly [6] where the generator is modi\ufb01ed as\nan autoencoder. However, it is believed that AnoGAN is not\nsuitable for audio anomaly detection, since the normal and\nanomalous distributions of spectrogram have minor differ-\nences, which contradicts its basic assumption. Reconstruction\nseems to be a more feasible approach, as reconstruction mod-\nels have already been proposed in DCASE Challenge. Typical\nreconstruction models [7, 8] are trained to reconstruct spec-\ntrogram and the reconstruction error is utilized as an indicator\nof anomaly. Ordinary explanation is that the reconstruction\nerror is expected to be bigger for anomaly since the model is\nonly trained on normal samples.\nHowever, we argue that reconstruction model only learns\nhow to denoise properly when the normal and anomalous\ndistributions are mostly overlapped, rather than learningarXiv:2303.17949v1  [cs.SD]  31 Mar 2023(a)\n (b)\nFig. 1 .

Although generative models tackle the more\nchallenging task of accurately modeling the underlying data\ndistribution, they can create a more complete representation\nof the world that can be utilized for various downstream\nCorrespondence to: Alexander Li <alexanderli@cmu.edu >tasks. As a result, a plethora of implicit and explicit gen-\nerative modeling approaches [26, 42, 46, 21, 77, 70, 79]\nhave been proposed over the last decade. However, the\nprimary focus of these works has been content creation\n[18, 8, 39, 40, 76, 34] rather than their ability to perform dis-\ncriminative tasks. In this paper, we revisit this classic gen-\nerative vs. discriminative debate in the context of diffusion\nmodels, the current state-of-the-art generative model fam-\nily. In particular, we examine how diffusion models com-\npare against the state-of-the-art discriminative models on\nthe task of image classification.\nDiffusion models are a recent class of likelihood-based\ngenerative models that model the data distribution via an\niterative noising and denoising procedure [70, 35]. They\nhave recently achieved state-of-the-art performance [20]\non several text-based content creation and editing tasks\n[24, 67, 34, 66, 59]. Diffusion models operate by per-\nforming two iterative processes\u2014the fixed forward process ,\nwhich destroys structure in the data by iteratively adding\nnoise, and the learned backward process , which attempts to\nrecover the structure in the noised data. These models are\ntrained via a variational objective, which maximizes an evi-\ndence lower bound (ELBO) [5] of the log-likelihood. For\nmost diffusion models, computing the ELBO consists of\nadding noise \u03f5to a sample, using the neural network to pre-\ndict the added noise, and measuring the prediction error.\nConditional generative models like diffusion models can\nbe easily converted into classifiers [54]. Given an input x\nand a finite set of classes cthat we want to choose from,\nwe can use the model to compute class-conditional likeli-\nhoods p\u03b8(x|c). Then, by selecting an appropriate prior\ndistribution p(c)and applying Bayes\u2019 theorem, we can get\npredicted class probabilities p(c|x). For conditional diffu-\nsion models that use an auxiliary input, like a class index for\nclass-conditioned models or prompt for text-to-image mod-\nels, we can do this by leveraging the ELBO as an approxi-\nmate class-conditional log-likelihood logp(x|c). In prac-\ntice, obtaining a diffusion model classifier through Bayes\u2019\ntheorem consists of repeatedly adding noise and computing\na Monte Carlo estimate of the expected noise reconstruction\nlosses (also called \u03f5-prediction loss) for every class. We call\nthis approach Diffusion Classifier .

Those systems were \ufb01ne-tuned with oracle performance\nmetrics, such as the AUC score calculated using the normal\nand anomaly samples provided for performance assessment.\nTherefore, the information from the anomaly samples had been\nleaked into the system.\nConsidering the above, the DCASE Challenge 2023 Task 2:\nFirst-shot Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection for Ma-\nchine Condition Monitoring (DCASE2023T2) will introduce\na First-shot requirement into the anomalous sound detection\ntask. The First-shot ASD task does not allow systems to do\nany hyperparameter tuning referencing the performance met-\nrics calculated with the grand truth, especially with anomaly\nsamples provided for evaluating systems.\nTo show benchmark performance for the First-shot ASD,\nthis paper provides an anomaly sound detection system\nthat works on the domain generalization task in the\nDCASE2022T2[3] while complying with the First-shot re-\nquirements newly introduced in the DCASE2023T2.\nThe DCASE2022T2 was for Domain Generalization. How-\never, it can be interpreted as a highly data-unbalanced training\ntask. The DCASE2022T2 Domain Generalization task is a\ntask that requires an ef\ufb01cient training scheme for unsupervised\nanomaly detection with highly unbalanced training data (990\nnormal samples from the source domain and only 10 samples\nfrom the target domain are given for training) and that no\ndomain label be given for testing target samples.\nThis paper proposes a simple implementation", " \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: RINs outperform U-Nets widely used in state-of-the-art image and video diffusion models, while being more efficient and domain-agnostic. Our models are simple pixel-level denoising diffusion models without cascades as in (CDM (Ho et\u00a0al., 2022a)) or guidance (as in\nADM (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2022) and VD (Ho et\u00a0al., 2022b)). ***: uses input scaling (Chen, 2023).\n\n\n\nFigure 2:  Overview of Recurrent Interface Networks.

A stack of blocks route information between X\ud835\udc4bXitalic_X and latents Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z, avoiding quadratic pairwise interactions between tokens in X (bottom left). Note that |Z|<|X|\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4b|Z|<|X|| italic_Z | < | italic_X |, and most computation is applied to Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z, which allows for scaling to large X. The network\u2019s read attention maps reveals how tokens are favored for latent computation (right), when trained for a task like diffusion generative modeling. See Figure\u00a06 for more visualizations.\n\n\n\nThe design of effective neural network architectures has been crucial\nto the success of deep learning\u00a0(Krizhevsky et\u00a0al., 2012; He et\u00a0al., 2016; Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017).\nInfluenced by modern accelerator hardware, predominant architectures,\nsuch as convolutional neural networks \u00a0(Fukushima, 1988; LeCun et\u00a0al., 1989; He et\u00a0al., 2016) and Transformers\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017), allocate computation\nin a fixed, uniform manner over the input data (e.g., over image pixels, image patches, or token sequences).\nInformation in natural data is often distributed unevenly, or exhibits redundancy, so\nit is important to ask how to allocate computation in an adaptive manner to improve scalability.\nWhile prior work has explored more dynamic and input-decoupled computation, e.g., networks with auxiliary memory \u00a0(Dai et\u00a0al., 2019; Rae et\u00a0al., 2019) and global units \u00a0(Zaheer et\u00a0al., 2020; Burtsev et\u00a0al., 2020; Jaegle et\u00a0al., 2021b, a),\ngeneral architectures that leverage adaptive computation to effectively scale to tasks with large input and output spaces remain elusive.\n\n\nHere, we consider this\nissue\nas it manifests in high-dimensional generative modeling tasks, such as image and video generation.\nWhen generating an image with a simple background, an adaptive architecture should ideally be able to allocate\ncomputation to regions with\ncomplex objects and textures, rather than regions with little or no structure (e.g., the sky).\nWhen generating video, one should exploit temporal redundancy, allocating less computation to static regions.\nWhile such non-uniform computation becomes more crucial in higher-dimensional data, achieving it\nefficiently is challenging, especially with modern hardware that favours fixed computation graphs and dense matrix multiplication.\n\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose an architecture, dubbed Recurrent Interface Networks (RINs).\nIn RINs (Fig.\u00a02), hidden units are partitioned into the interface X\ud835\udc4bXitalic_X and latents Z\ud835\udc4dZitalic_Z.\nInterface units are locally connected to the input and grow linearly with input size.\nIn contrast, latents are decoupled from the input space, forming a more compact representation on which the bulk of computation operates.\nThe forward pass proceeds as a stack of blocks that read, compute, and write:\nin each block, information is routed from interface tokens (with cross-attention) into the latents for high-capacity global processing (with self-attention), and updates are written back to interface tokens (with cross-attention).\nAlternating computation between latents and interface allows for processing at local and global levels, accumulating context for better routing.\nAs such, RINs allocate computation more dynamically\nthan uniform models, scaling better when\ninformation is unevenly distributed across the input and output, as is", " INTRODUCTION\nAnomalous sound detection systems (ASD) are automatic inspec-\ntion systems that identify anomalous sounds emitted from machines\n[1\u20138]. Because these systems use microphones to conduct inspec-\ntions, contactless inspections of anomalies inside the machines can\nbe realized, unlike the vibration monitoring systems [9\u201311].\nFor the widespread application of ASD systems, researchers\nhave mainly tackled two types of challenges. First, in real-world\ncases, only a few anomalous samples are available or provided\nanomalous samples do not cover all possible types of anoma-\nlies. Therefore, unsupervised anomaly detection methods using domain generalization techniques. The dataset con-\nsists of \ufb01ve different machine types; fan, gearbox, bearing, slide\nrail, and valve. Each machine type includes three sections, each of\nwhich corresponds to a type of domain shift. Each section consists\nof the source domain data to be used for generalizing the model\nand the target domain data for evaluating the domain generaliza-\ntion performance. The source domain has at least two different sets\nof values that cause domain shifts to generalize the model. Also,\ndomain shifts that can only be handled with domain generalization\ntechniques are included in the dataset. The dataset is freely available\nathttps://zenodo.org/record/6529888 and is a subset\nof the dataset for Task 2 of the DCASE 2022 Challenge.arXiv:2205.13879v2  [cs.SD]  22 Nov 2022Detection and Classi\ufb01cation of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2022 3\u20134 November 2022, Nancy, France\n2. RECORDING ENVIRONMENT AND SETUP\nWe prepared \ufb01ve types of machines (fan, gearbox, bearing, slide\nrail, and valve), three types of factory noise data (factory noise A,\nB, and C), and three different domain shift scenarios for each ma-\nchine type. The types of machines and domain shift scenarios were\nchosen on the basis of our experiences building ASD systems for\nreal-world commercial solutions. Here, we identify each scenario\nof domain shifts by section IDs . The details of the type of do-\nmain shift for each section and the values of the parameters that\nshift between domains, the domain shift parameters, are described\nin Table 1.\nWe then recorded sound data of each machine to reproduce\nthe domain shift scenarios we assumed. We recorded both normal\nand anomalous sounds for each domain, where to reproduce\nanomalous sounds, we used deliberately damaged machines or\noperated machines in an incorrect manner. For recording, we used\na TAMAGO-03 microphone manufactured by System In Frontier\nInc. [19]. The recording was conducted either in a sound-proof\nroom (Fan and Valve) or in an anechoic chamber (Gearbox,\nBearing, Slide rail). Although the microphone has eight channels,\nwe only used the \ufb01rst channel for the dataset. Recorded sound clips\nare 16-bit audio with a sampling rate of 16 kHz and are 10 seconds\nlong. Examples of spectrograms for each machine type are shown\nin Figure 1. A short description and recording procedures of each\nmachine type are as follows.\nFan An industrial fan used to keep gas or air \ufb02owing in a factory.\nOperational conditions were kept the same between source and\ntarget domains, since Fan was dedicated to environmental domain\nshifts.

We\nchanged the operation", " INTRODUCTION\nRecently, several research efforts have focused on anomaly detec-\ntion. An anomaly detection task is designed to detect anomaly states\nby learning only normal condition data. Microphones have been\nused as sensors to detect anomalies, referred to as anomaly sound\ndetection (ASD) or acoustic condition monitoring [1\u20139]. This task\nsetting is different from other sound event detection tasks such as\ngunshot detection [10].\nIn general, it is very dif\ufb01cult or almost impossible to collect\nmassive anomaly data. The ToyADMOS [11] and MIMII [12]\ndatasets are the \ufb01rst ones to be used for evaluating anomaly de-\ntection systems using sound. These datasets enable us to compare\nthe performance of different systems. In 2020, a number of systems\nfrom various research organizations in academia and industry were\nsubmitted to \u201cDCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2, Unsupervised detec-\ntion of anomalous sounds for machine condition monitoring [13].\u201d\nThe submitted systems performed quite well on the task, showing\nthe great potential of applying deep-learning-based systems for un-\nsupervised anomaly detection tasks [14\u201319].\nHowever, in reality, the given application ASD scenario in the\nDCASE 2020 challenge was not ideal compared to realistic cases.\nThe task setting was too basic, and the task requirements were much\neasier than it would be for typical ones in practical applications,where for example, the same machine type but different models are\nused at different operating speeds, and the conditions are not given\nas training data. Several independent research groups have tackled\ndomain-shift or domain-adaptation related tasks [20\u201325], but few\nopen datasets that could serve this need have been made available.\nThough the previous ToyADMOS dataset has some data variations\nthat can be used for testing domain-shift conditions, we would like\nto have more variations on the test con\ufb01guration.\nWhen evaluating the performance of ASD systems, the statisti-\ncal characteristics of anomalous sound samples should be different\nfrom that of normal samples. However, if the difference is too sig-\nni\ufb01cant, the anomaly detection task might not be dif\ufb01cult enough to\nevaluate system performance. One way of controlling the dif\ufb01cultly\nof the test con\ufb01guration is to adjust the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nof the added noise level, but noise reduction techniques, such as the\nones in [15, 26], can be used to mitigate the dif\ufb01culty of the task.\nTherefore, there should be a way to control the dif\ufb01culty, without\nrelying on the SNR.\nThe dif\ufb01culty of the task under domain shifts can be con-\ntrolled by changing the statistical difference among normal samples\nacross domains and/or the statistical difference between normal and\nanomaly sound samples within a domain. In designing challenging\ntest conditions, it is nice to strike an appropriate balance between\nthese two approaches.\nTo address the application scenarios discussed above, we pro-\nvide yet another ADMOS dataset called ToyADMOS2. The Toy-\nADMOS2 dataset adds more variations on condition arrangements\ndedicated to domain shifts. Like we did for the previous ToyAD-\nMOS dataset, we collected normal and anomalous operating sounds\nof miniature machines by deliberately damaging their components.\nThe ToyADMOS2 dataset has the following characteristics:\n\u000fDesigned for two ADMOS tasks: product inspection (toy car)\nand fault diagnosis for a moving machine (toy train).\n\u000fProvides controlled domain-shift conditions on machine mod-\nels, part con\ufb01gurations, operating speeds, microphone models\nand arrangements, and environmental noise.\n\u000fEnables control of depth of damage in anomaly samples to pro-\nvide choices on signi\ufb01cance levels of statistical differences be-\ntween normal and anomalous samples.\nNote that the ToyADMOS2 dataset can be", " Introduction\nFigure 1: Selected samples from our best ImageNet 512 \u0002512 model (FID 3.85)\nOver the past few years, generative models have gained the ability to generate human-like natural\nlanguage [ 6], in\ufb01nite high-quality synthetic images [ 5,28,51] and highly diverse human speech and\nmusic [ 64,13]. These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text\nprompts [ 72,50] or learning useful feature representations [ 14,7]. While these models are already\n\u0003Equal contributionarXiv:2105.05233v4  [cs.LG]  1 Jun 2021capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond\nthe current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic\ndesign, games, music production, and countless other \ufb01elds.\nGANs [ 19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [ 5,68,28] as measured\nby sample quality metrics such as FID [ 23], Inception Score [ 54] and Precision [ 32]. However, some\nof these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity\nthan state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [ 51,43,42]. Furthermore, GANs are often dif\ufb01cult to\ntrain, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4].\nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them dif\ufb01cult to scale and apply to\nnew domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with\nlikelihood-based models [ 51,25,42,9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically\neasier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore,\nexcept for V AEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time.\nDiffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models which have recently been shown to produce\nhigh-quality images [ 56,59,25] while offering desirable properties such as distribution coverage,\na stationary training objective, and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually\nremoving noise from a signal, and their training objective can be expressed as a reweighted variational\nlower-bound [ 25]. This class of models already holds the state-of-the-art [ 60] on CIFAR-10 [ 31], but\nstill lags behind GANs on dif\ufb01cult generation datasets like LSUN and ImageNet. Nichol and Dhariwal\n[43] found that these models improve reliably with increased compute, and can produce high-quality\nsamples even on the dif\ufb01cult ImageNet 256 \u0002256 dataset using an upsampling stack. However, the\nFID of this model is still not competitive with BigGAN-deep [5], the current state-of-the-art on this\ndataset.\nWe hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors:\n\ufb01rst, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and\nre\ufb01ned; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for \ufb01delity, producing high quality samples\nbut not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these bene\ufb01ts to diffusion models, \ufb01rst by\nimproving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for \ufb01delity.\nWith these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different\nmetrics and datasets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion\nmodels based on Ho et al. [ 25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [ 43] and Song\net al. [ 57], and", " INTRODUCTION\nAs a number of companies worldwide are facing a shortage of\nskilled maintenance workers, the demand for an automatic sound-\nmonitoring system has been increasing. Unsupervised anomaly\ndetection methods to decide the hyperparameters.8. results demonstrated that our background. Hendrycks et al. [13] used auxiliary\ndatasets of outliers to improve the detection performance. However,\nthe proposed loss function can destabilize the detection performance.\nKirichenko et al. [14] proposed a loss function to distinguish the in-\ndistribution data from out-of-distribution data by means of a super-\nvised approach. The authors argued that this method cannot be used\nto detect out-of-distribution data not included in the training dataset.\nWe show that this method can be used for detecting anomalies if\nsound data of the same machine type as the target data is used for\nthe outlier data in the training dataset.\n3.2. A self-supervised approach for anomaly detection\nIn DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2, top rankers trained classi\ufb01ers to\npredict a machine ID of the data [8, 15]. This approach assumes that\nthe classi\ufb01er can output a false machine ID if the data is anomalous.\nGiri et al. [8] named this approach a self-supervised classi\ufb01cation-\nbased approach. However, we found that this approach can fail on\nsome machine IDs, and the detection performance degrades signi\ufb01-\ncantly. To stabilize the detection performance, our proposed method\nincorporates the unsupervised approach by using the NLL to distin-\nguish the target data from the outlier data.\n4. CONVENTIONAL APPROACH\nNormalizing Flows (NF) is a series of invertible transformations\nbetween an input data distribution p(x)and a known distribution\np(z). Anomaly score can be calculated by the negative log likeli-\nhood (NLL) of the input data [16, 17, 18, 19]. However, this score\nis dependent on the smoothness of the input data and fails at out-of-\ndistribution detection.\nKirichenko [14] proposed a loss function to distinguish the in-\ndistribution data from the out-of-distribution data by using a super-\nvised approach:\nL=1\nNDX\nx2DNLL(x)\n\u00001\nNOODX\nx2OODNLL(x)\u0001I[NLL(x)< c];(1)\nwhere NDis the number of the in-distribution data in each batch,\nNODD is the number of the out-of-distribution data in each batch\nthat satis\ufb01es the condition in the indicator function I[\u0001], and cis a\nthreshold value.\n5. PROPOSED APPROACH\nTo overcome the problems of NF models and the self-supervised\nclassi\ufb01cation-based approach, our method attempts to assign higher\nlikelihood to the target data and lower likelihood to the outlier data\nusing NF.\nWe train a model for each machine ID, where the data with that\nID is the target data xtand other machine sounds of the same ma-\nchine type is the outlier data xe. Assume xtandxeconsist of com-\nponents speci\ufb01c to their machine IDs ( xt0,xe0) and components\nshared across the same machine type ( xc). The likelihood of xtand\nFig. 1 . Illustration of the proposed approach.\nxecan be written as\np(xt) =p(xt0)p(xc); (2)\np(xe) =p(xe0)p(xc): (3)\nIf the model is trained to assign higher likelihood to xtand lower\nlikelihood to xe, only components speci\ufb01c to the machine ID ( xt0,\nxe0) will affect the likelihood. Therefore, we can improve the de-\ntection performance of a NF model by introducing an auxiliary task\nin which we train the NF model to discriminate the target data xt\nfrom the outlier data xeby the likelihood. When testing the model,\nthe NLL is used as the anomaly score. The anomaly score will be\nhigher when the data structure is different from the target data spe-\nci\ufb01c component xt0or close to the", " Introduction\nSohl-Dickstein et al. (2015) introduced diffusion probabilis-\ntic models, a class of generative models which match a\ndata distribution by learning to reverse a gradual, multi-step\nnoising process. More recently, Ho et al. (2020) showed\nan equivalence between denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels (DDPM) and score based generative models (Song\n& Ermon, 2019; 2020), which learn a gradient of the log-\ndensity of the data distribution using denoising score match-\ning (Hyv \u00a8arinen, 2005). It has recently been shown that this\nclass of models can produce high-quality images (Ho et al.,\n2020; Song & Ermon, 2020; Jolicoeur-Martineau et al.,\n2020) and audio (Chen et al., 2020b; Kong et al., 2020),\nbut it has yet to be shown that DDPMs can achieve log-\nlikelihoods competitive with other likelihood-based models\nsuch as autoregressive models (van den Oord et al., 2016c)\nand V AEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013). This raises various\nquestions, such as whether DDPMs are capable of capturing\nall the modes of a distribution. Furthermore, while Ho et al.\n*Equal contribution1OpenAI, San Francisco, USA.

To accelerate sam-\npling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more ef\ufb01cient\nclass of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as\nDDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is de\ufb01ned as the reverse of a particular\nMarkovian diffusion process. We generalize DDPMs via a class of non-Markovian\ndiffusion processes that lead to the same training objective. These non-Markovian\nprocesses can correspond to generative processes that are deterministic, giving rise\nto implicit models that produce high quality samples much faster. We empirically\ndemonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples 10\u0002to50\u0002faster in\nterms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation\nfor sample quality, perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly\nin the latent space, and reconstruct observations with very low error.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nDeep generative models have demonstrated the ability to produce high quality samples in many\ndomains (Karras et al., 2020; van den Oord et al., 2016a).

A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after \ufb01nite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is suf\ufb01cient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to de\ufb01ne and ef\ufb01cient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published Background\nDiffusion models [ 53] are latent variable models of the form p\u0012(x0):=R\np\u0012(x0:T)dx1:T, where\nx1;:::;xTare latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0\u0018q(x0). The joint distribution\np\u0012(x0:T)is called the reverse process , and it is de\ufb01ned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian\ntransitions starting at p(xT) =N(xT;0;I):\np\u0012(x0:T):=p(xT)TY\nt=1p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt); p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt):=N(xt\u00001;\u0016\u0012(xt;t);\u0006\u0012(xt;t)) (1)\nWhat distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate\nposteriorq(x1:Tjx0), called the forward process ordiffusion process , is \ufb01xed to a Markov chain that\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule \f1;:::;\fT:\nq(x1:Tjx0):=TY\nt=1q(xtjxt\u00001); q (xtjxt\u00001):=N(xt;p\n1\u0000\ftxt\u00001;\ftI) (2)\nTraining is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:\nE[\u0000logp\u0012(x0)]\u0014Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp\u0012(x0:T)\nq(x1:Tjx0)\u0015\n=Eq\u0014\n\u0000logp(xT)\u0000X\nt\u00151logp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt)\nq(xtjxt\u00001)\u0015\n=:L(3)\nThe forward process variances \ftcan be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as\nhyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of\nGaussian conditionals in p\u0012(xt\u00001jxt), because both processes have the same functional form when\n\ftare small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xtat an\narbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation \u000bt:= 1\u0000\ftand\u0016\u000bt:=Qt\ns=1\u000bs, we have\nq(xtjx0) =N(xt;p\u0016\u000btx0;(1\u0000\u0016\u000bt)I) (4)\n2Ef\ufb01cient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient\ndescent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as:\nEq\u0014\nDKL(q(xTjx0)kp(xT))|{z}\nLT+X\nt>1DKL(q(xt\u00001jxt;x0)kp\u0012(xt\u00001jxt))| {z }\nLt\u00001\u0000logp\u0012(x0jx1)|{z}\nL0\u0015\n(5)\n(See Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse\nimplication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational\ninference to train a Langevin-like sampler.

We replaced weight normalization [ 49] with group normalization [", " INTRODUCTION\nAnomalous sound detection (ASD) [1\u20136] is the task of identify-\ning whether the sound emitted from a target machine is normal or\nanomalous. Automatic detection of mechanical failure is an essen-\ntial technology in the fourth industrial revolution, which includes ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI)-based factory automation, and also prompt\ndetection of machine anomaly by observing its sounds may be use-\nful for machine condition monitoring. To connect the Detection\nand Classi\ufb01cation of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) chal-\nlenge tasks and real-world problems, we organize a new DCASE\nChallenge task: \u201c unsupervised ASD \u201d.\nThe main challenge of this task is to detect unknown anomalous\nsounds under the condition that only normal sound samples have\nbeen provided as training data [1\u20136]. In real-world factories, actual\nanomalous sounds rarely occur but are highly diverse. Therefore,\nexhaustive patterns of anomalous sounds are impossible to delib-\nerately make and/or collect. This means that we must detect un-\nknown anomalous sounds that were not in the given training data.\nThis point is one of the major differences in premise between ASD\nfor industrial equipment and the past supervised DCASE challenge\ntasks for detecting de\ufb01ned anomalous sounds such as gunshots or a\nbaby crying [7].\nThe importance of unsupervised ASD has been recognized for\na long time, and various approaches have been investigated [8\u201317].\nIn early studies, acoustic features for detecting anomalies were de-\nsigned on the basis of the mechanical structure of the target ma-chine [18\u201320]. Bene\ufb01ting from the development of deep learn-\ning, deep neural network (DNN)-based methods [35] and a class identi\ufb01cation to train an embed-\nding DNN [36]. We, the organizers, hope that all technical reports\nof this challenge will be read by many researchers, contributing to\nadvancements in both the academic \ufb01eld and the industrial use of\nunsupervised ASD.\n6. Results for evaluation dataset\nWe received 117 submissions from 40 teams and most teams\nachieved better performance than the baseline system (the team rank\nof the baseline system was 33rd), which indicates that the challengewas \ufb01erce. Because of space limitation, we show the average AUC\nandpAUC of the top 10 teams in the team ranking [32\u201341] in Fig. 1.\nAs indicated by the ranking rule of this task, achieving high scores\non all Machine Types was important. The top \ufb01ve teams [32\u201336]\nachieved consistently high scores in all Machine Types. On the\nother hand, some teams [37,38] achieved high scores on several ma-\nchine types, but, they dropped in the ranks owing to relatively low\nToy-conveyor scores. In the following sections, we discuss these\ntwo distinctive RESULTS\n4.1. CONCLUSIONS\nWe presented an overview of the task and analysis of the solutions\nsubmitted to the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2. The main chal-\nlenge of this task was to detect unknown anomalous sounds under\nthe condition that only normal sound samples have been provided\nas training data. Several novel approaches were developed as a re-\nsult of this challenge. We analyzed all evaluation REFERENCES\n[1] Y . Koizumi, S. Saito, H. Uematsu, and N.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally ef\ufb01cient,\nhas little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients,\nand is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters.\nThe method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with\nvery noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpre-\ntations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms,\non which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical con-\nvergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the conver-\ngence rate that is comparable to the best knownresults were achieved with small\nvalues of (1\u2212\u03b22)and bias correction; this was more apparent towards the end of optimization when\ngradients tends to become sparser as hidden units specialize to speci\ufb01c patterns. In summary, Adam\nperformed equal or better than RMSProp, regardless of hyper-parameter setting.\n7 E XTENSIONS\n7.1 A DAMAX\nIn Adam, the update rule for individual weights is to scale their gradients inversely proportional to a\n(scaled)L2norm of their individual current and past gradients. We can generalize the L2norm based\nupdate rule to a Lpnorm based update rule. Such variants become numerically unstable for large\np. However, in the special case where we let p\u2192\u221e , a surprisingly simple and stable algorithm\nemerges; see algorithm 2. We\u2019ll now derive the algorithm. Let, in case of the Lpnorm, the stepsize\nat timetbe inversely proportional to v1/p\nt, where:\nvt=\u03b2p\n2vt\u22121+ (1\u2212\u03b2p\n2)|gt|p(6)\n= (1\u2212\u03b2p\n2)t/summationdisplay\ni=1\u03b2p(t\u2212i)\n2\u00b7|gi|p(7)\n8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015\nAlgorithm 2: AdaMax , a variant of Adam based on the in\ufb01nity norm.

Also note that the magnitude of parameter updates has a simpler bound with\nAdaMax than Adam, namely: |\u2206t|\u2264\u03b1.\n7.2 T EMPORAL AVERAGING\nSince the last iterate is noisy due to stochastic approximation, better generalization performance is\noften achieved by averaging. Previously in Moulines & Bach (2011), Polyak-Ruppert averaging\n(Polyak & Juditsky, 1992; Ruppert, 1988) has been shown to improve the convergence of standard\nSGD, where \u00af\u03b8t=1\nt/summationtextn\nk=1\u03b8k. Alternatively, an exponential moving average over the parameters can\nbe used, giving higher weight to more recent parameter values. This can be trivially implemented\nby adding one line to the inner loop of algorithms 1 and 2: \u00af\u03b8t\u2190\u03b22\u00b7\u00af\u03b8t\u22121+(1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b8t, with \u00af\u03b80= 0.\nInitalization bias can again be corrected by the estimator /hatwide\u03b8t=\u00af\u03b8t/(1\u2212\u03b2t\n2).\n8 C ONCLUSION\nWe have introduced a simple and"]}
