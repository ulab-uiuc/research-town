    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intricacies of graph theory and its applications, particularly in the realm of generating structurally diverse graphs. My recent work addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding the generation of diverse graph structures, which is crucial for testing graph algorithms and their neural approximations. I delve into defining what diversity means in the context of graphs, recognizing the complexities involved in selecting appropriate diversity measures.\n\nIn my research, I have developed and compared various algorithms aimed at optimizing graph diversity, including traditional random graph models, local graph optimization techniques, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. My findings demonstrate that it is indeed possible to enhance diversity beyond what basic random graph generators can achieve. Through this work, I have gained valuable insights into the properties of graph distances and how different diversity measures can lead to graphs with distinct structural characteristics. This research not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of graph properties but also has practical implications for the development of more robust graph algorithms.",

My work primarily revolves around the construction of exceptional collections in the bounded derived category of $S_k$-equivariant coherent sheaves on projective spaces. I have successfully developed rectangular and minimal Lefschetz exceptional collections, particularly in cases involving three-dimensional settings and specific conditions on the dimensions of the projective spaces.\n\nIn functional analysis, I explore the properties of topological vector spaces of holomorphic functions, focusing on the conditions under which polynomial sets generate these spaces. My research has led to significant insights into the continuity of evaluation functionals and the structure of maximal domains, particularly in metrizable spaces.\n\nRecently, I have ventured into graph theory, addressing the challenge of generating structurally diverse graphs. I have defined measures of diversity and proposed various algorithms, including genetic and neural generative models, to optimize these measures.
