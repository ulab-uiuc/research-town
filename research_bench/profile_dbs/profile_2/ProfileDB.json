    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to the intersection of machine learning and computer network defense, with a focus on developing autonomous systems that enhance security in complex environments. My work explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to create intelligent defense agents capable of adapting to various attack strategies. I have designed an end-to-end methodology that visualizes adversarial behavior through state diagrams, allowing for informed intervention points and improved agent performance.\n\nIn addition to network defense, I am actively investigating the implications of generative large language models (LLMs) in terms of accountability and copyright issues. My recent research aims to trace the origins of fine-tuned LLMs back to their pre-trained base models, addressing concerns over model theft and harmful content generation. This work is crucial in establishing transparency within the model supply chain.\n\nFurthermore, I have explored the resilience of communication networks in disaster relief scenarios, particularly when faced with compromised drones. By leveraging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, I have developed strategies that maximize communication bandwidth despite adversarial disruptions. My findings highlight the importance of information-rich observations, expert-guided learning, and reward optimization in enhancing the performance of learning-based agents.\n\nThrough my research, I strive to contribute to the development of robust, autonomous systems that can effectively defend against evolving threats in both network security and generative technologies.",
