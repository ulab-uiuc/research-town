    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing societal issues through advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of hate speech detection, wildlife trafficking, and human activity recognition. My recent work focuses on developing robust frameworks that not only enhance detection accuracy but also ensure fairness and resilience against adversarial attacks. For instance, I designed a novel hate speech detection framework that leverages Bidirectional Quaternion-Quasi-LSTM layers, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.\n\nIn addition to hate speech, I have tackled the challenge of detecting wildlife trafficking behaviors in online social networks. By creating a scalable dataset and employing a human-in-the-loop machine learning process, I developed a practical framework that identifies suspicious wildlife selling posts, contributing to efforts in combating environmental crimes.\n\nMy research also delves into the complexities of human activity recognition, where I introduced a Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning framework. This innovative approach captures the nuances of context-aware data, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models.\n\nI am passionate about making my work accessible to the research community, sharing code and datasets to foster collaboration and further exploration. My goal is to leverage machine learning to create impactful solutions that address real-world challenges, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society.",

    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to understanding and mitigating the impact of misinformation and hate speech in online environments. My work spans various domains, including crowdfunding, social media analysis, and automated fact-checking systems. I have conducted extensive studies on the characteristics of on-time and late reward delivery in crowdfunding projects, revealing key factors that influence project success.\n\nIn the realm of misinformation, I have developed innovative models such as the Hierarchical Multi-head Attentive Network for fact-checking and a novel fact-checking URL recommendation system to enhance user engagement in combating fake news. My research also delves into the dynamics of public health crises, analyzing social media responses during outbreaks like Ebola to inform future health communication strategies.\n\nI am particularly passionate about creating robust frameworks for hate speech detection, exemplified by my SWE2 model, which effectively identifies hate speech while maintaining resilience against adversarial attacks. Additionally, I have explored the potential of large language models for data augmentation, demonstrating their ability to enhance performance across various tasks.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and social responsibility, providing tools and insights that empower users to navigate the complexities of information in the digital age. My research not only contributes to academic knowledge but also has practical implications for improving online discourse and fostering a more informed society.",
