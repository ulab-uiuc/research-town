    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to integrating large language models (LLMs) into industrial automation systems, with a focus on enhancing task automation, flexibility, and intelligent planning. My recent work explores the intersection of LLMs, digital twins, and production processes, where I have developed frameworks that enable LLM agents to interpret production-specific data and generate executable process plans. By retrofitting automation systems and creating digital twins, I empower LLMs to orchestrate complex tasks autonomously, significantly improving the adaptability of production environments.\n\nOne of my notable contributions is the design of a multi-agent system that utilizes LLMs for the parametrization of simulation models in digital twins. This framework not only enhances usability but also reduces cognitive load on users by assisting in complex decision-making. I have also tackled the challenge of semantic interoperability in digital twins, creating a system that automates the generation of Asset Administration Shells (AAS) from raw textual data, demonstrating a high success rate in translating technical information into digital models.\n\nAdditionally, I have explored decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning to address the complexities of multi-robot tasks, proposing innovative methods that achieve near-centralized performance in real-world applications. My research aims to bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and practical industrial applications, paving the way for smarter, more efficient production systems.
