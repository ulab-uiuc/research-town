    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of robotics, particularly in the areas of navigation and motion planning. My recent work focuses on the application of diffusion models to end-to-end navigation, where I explore the integration of perception and planning. I have developed a novel diffusion model that generates collision-free paths in complex 2D environments, leveraging egocentric LIDAR scans and arbitrary maps to facilitate real-time localization and planning.\n\nIn addition to my work on diffusion models, I have also created a motion planning framework tailored for multi-modal vehicle dynamics. By employing sparse factor graphs, I optimize trajectories for vehicles with varying dynamics, such as airplanes and VTOL aircraft. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of mode transitions but also streamlines the optimization process, allowing for effective trajectory planning in both simulated and real-world scenarios.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications in robotics, contributing to the development of intelligent systems capable of navigating complex environments with precision and adaptability.",
