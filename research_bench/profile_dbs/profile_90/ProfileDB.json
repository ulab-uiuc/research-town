    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to the development of intelligent agents that leverage knowledge engineering and cognitive architectures to enhance their functionality across various domains. My work emphasizes the integration of dialog act modeling within holistic systems, allowing agents to expand their ontological and lexical knowledge through lifelong learning. I have explored the discovery and representation of lexical rules, demonstrating their critical role in large-scale semi-automatic lexicon acquisition, particularly in business and finance contexts.\n\nA significant focus of my research is on the application of large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the automatic learning of new semantic entries in intelligent agents. By combining knowledge-based methods with LLMs, I have developed hybrid learning architectures that enhance the agent's ability to understand and generate natural language.\n\nI am also passionate about metacognition in artificial intelligence, proposing a framework called TRAP that addresses transparency, reasoning, adaptation, and perception in AI systems. My work on the HARMONIC framework aims to transform general-purpose robots into trusted teammates capable of complex decision-making and natural communication, emphasizing the importance of explainability in high-stakes AI applications.\n\nThrough my research, I strive to create cognitive agents that not only perform tasks but also communicate effectively and provide explanations for their actions, fostering trust and collaboration in human-robot teams. My recent projects demonstrate the potential of integrating cognitive strategies with natural language communication to enhance multi-robot planning and collaboration in real-world scenarios.",

    "bio": "As a researcher deeply invested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and human interaction, I focus on the critical need for explainability in high-stakes AI systems. My work addresses the limitations of traditional machine learning models, which often operate as black boxes, leaving users without the necessary insights to trust their decisions. I advocate for a hybrid approach that combines knowledge-based infrastructures with machine learning, enabling the development of cognitive agents that can provide meaningful explanations tailored to the needs of users in critical domains.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to redefine what it means to explain AI systems, moving beyond the constraints of the human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) movement. I believe that by creating agents that assist humans\u2014who ultimately bear responsibility for decisions\u2014we can foster a more transparent and accountable AI landscape. My recent work illustrates this potential through a demonstration system where simulated robots collaborate on tasks, showcasing how these agents can effectively communicate their reasoning and actions. My goal is to empower users with the understanding they need to confidently engage with AI technologies in their everyday lives.",
