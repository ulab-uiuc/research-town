My recent work has delved into the stability of orbits in the Earth-Mars belt, revealing a narrower region where small bodies can survive over 4.5 billion years. I have also explored the intriguing dynamics of sednoids, uncovering a primordial alignment that suggests significant events during the planet formation epoch.\n\nIn addition to my studies on TNOs, I have investigated the unique dynamics of retrograde mean-motion resonances, particularly with Jupiter and Saturn, and have identified potential candidates for retrograde co-orbital resonance with Saturn. My research employs advanced numerical simulations and analytical tools to understand the complex interactions and stability of binary planets within star clusters, contributing to our understanding of the formation and evolution of celestial systems.\n\nBeyond planetary dynamics, I have ventured into the realm of natural language processing, developing innovative techniques like MetaPT for prompt tuning in language models and Atomic Self-Consistency (ASC) to enhance the recall of relevant information in long-form responses. My interdisciplinary approach combines astrophysics and machine learning, aiming to uncover the underlying principles governing both celestial mechanics and artificial intelligence. Through my work, I strive to bridge the gap between these fields, contributing to a deeper understanding of our universe and the technologies we create.",
