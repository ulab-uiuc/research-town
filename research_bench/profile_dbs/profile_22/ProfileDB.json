    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing human-robot collaboration, particularly in the context of agile robots operating in close proximity to humans. My work addresses the safety and performance challenges that arise from this collaboration. I have developed a novel human-robot doubles table tennis scenario as a testbed to explore these dynamics. Through user studies, I have uncovered critical insights into how robot attributes, such as competency and communication, influence team dynamics, perceived safety, and trust. Notably, I found that while robot competency boosts perceived trust, vocalizing intentions can paradoxically hinder team performance and safety perceptions.\n\nIn addition to my focus on collaboration, I am also advancing robot learning methodologies. I have created a diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and capable of expressing diverse agile behaviors. My kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique effectively directs the sampling process to minimize constraint violations while maintaining trajectory fidelity. This approach has shown significant improvements in performance for time-sensitive tasks, such as simulated air hockey and real table tennis, outperforming traditional imitation learning methods.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to pave the way for safe, efficient, and trustworthy interactions between humans and agile robots, ultimately enhancing their collaborative potential in various applications.",
