    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of sound detection, speech recognition, and voice conversion through innovative machine learning techniques. My recent work includes developing Anomalous Sound Detection based on Diffusion Models (ASD-Diffusion), which effectively identifies anomalies in factory environments by reconstructing acoustic features and employing a novel post-processing filter. This method has shown a significant performance improvement in real-world applications.\n\nI am also passionate about addressing challenges in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), particularly in code-switching scenarios. My approach integrates a speech-conditioned Large Language Model (LLM) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, utilizing a unique Insertion and Deletion of Interruption Token (IDIT) mechanism to enhance text generation capabilities. This work has yielded substantial improvements over existing models.\n\nIn the realm of voice conversion, I have pioneered a Zero-Shot any-to-any Singing Voice Conversion method that leverages clustering-based phoneme representation, allowing for precise manipulation of voice characteristics. My research emphasizes the importance of sound quality and timbre accuracy, contributing to advancements in voice conversion technology.\n\nAdditionally, I have made strides in multimodal emotion recognition, achieving first place in the MER2024-SEMI challenge with my EmoVCLIP model, which enhances video-based emotion recognition through innovative prompt learning techniques. My work in cross-age speaker verification focuses on disentangled representation learning, addressing the challenges posed by aging in voice recognition systems.\n\nOverall, my research aims to push the boundaries of audio and speech technologies, making them more robust, efficient, and applicable to real-world scenarios.",

    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction and community detection.\n\nI also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, thereby enhancing their scalability and effectiveness.\n\nBeyond architectural advancements, I have delved into the design space of GNNs, systematically studying over 315,000 configurations to provide guidelines for optimal model design. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the search for effective neural architectures by leveraging prior knowledge and improving efficiency.\n\nThrough these contributions, I strive to push the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve, fostering a deeper understanding of their structure and performance across diverse applications.",
