    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of automated planning and decision-making through innovative approaches to problem decomposition and policy learning. My recent work focuses on enhancing width-based planning methods, particularly in addressing the limitations of existing algorithms like SIW when dealing with complex conjunctive goals. By introducing policy sketches\u2014a powerful language for expressing nuanced problem decompositions\u2014I have demonstrated how these sketches can facilitate efficient planning in domains previously deemed intractable.\n\nI have also explored the automatic learning of sketches, leveraging logical formulations and implementing solutions with ASP solvers like Clingo. This work has led to the development of a domain-independent planner that effectively learns and utilizes domain structure, showcasing the potential of sketches in simplifying complex planning tasks.\n\nAdditionally, I have investigated the role of state symmetries in planning, emphasizing their importance in reducing search space and enhancing learning efficiency. My research highlights the limitations of current learning architectures in distinguishing non-symmetric states, and I have proposed methods to improve symmetry detection, ultimately leading to more effective policy learning.\n\nThrough my work, I aim to create flexible and reusable planning languages that incorporate internal memory states, indexical features, and modular structures, thereby expanding the expressive power of policies and sketches. I am passionate about bridging theoretical advancements with practical applications, contributing to the evolution of intelligent planning systems.",

    "bio": "As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction and community detection.\n\nI also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction tasks. Additionally, I proposed the ROLAND framework, which facilitates the adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic graphs, addressing the challenges of evolving data structures.\n\nMy research extends beyond GNNs; I have investigated the interplay between neural network architecture and predictive performance through relational graphs, and I have systematically explored the design space of GNNs to provide guidelines for optimal architecture selection. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient and effective machine learning models. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve and fostering a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.",
