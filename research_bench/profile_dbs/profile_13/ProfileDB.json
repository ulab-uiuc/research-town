My recent publications reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.\n\nI am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a \"sweet spot\" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities during the aggregation process.\n\nAdditionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML), where I introduced methods like FALCON and AutoTransfer to improve the efficiency of model design searches by leveraging prior knowledge across tasks.\n\nOverall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, providing scalable solutions that enhance the performance of GNNs across a variety of domains. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve and contributing to the broader understanding of their design and functionality.",
