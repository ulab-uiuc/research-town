    "bio": "I am a researcher dedicated to advancing methodologies in dense pixelwise prediction and distributed optimization, with a strong focus on practical applications in computer vision and multi-agent systems. My recent work introduces the Flattening Module, which enhances Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) for high-resolution predictions without the complexity of traditional architectures. This innovation has shown promising results in human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection.\n\nIn the realm of remote sensing, I developed the Pyramid Time-Series Transformer (PTST), a novel approach that efficiently processes high-resolution satellite image time series for crop classification. This framework not only reduces GPU memory consumption but also integrates semi-supervised learning techniques to enhance performance with limited labeled data.\n\nMy research also delves into distributed algorithms for resource allocation in multi-agent systems, particularly under adversarial conditions such as false data injection attacks. I propose resilient algorithms that ensure optimal resource allocation while maintaining stability, even in the presence of malicious interference.\n\nAdditionally, I explore aggregative games over networks, focusing on Nash equilibria and the dynamics of multi-integrator agents. My work emphasizes the importance of communication efficiency, proposing discrete-time schemes that allow agents to converge to equilibrium without real-time interaction.\n\nThrough these contributions, I aim to bridge theoretical advancements with practical implementations, providing robust solutions to complex problems in machine learning and distributed systems.",
