My recent work has centered on addressing the limitations of traditional diffusion models, especially in capturing heavy-tailed distributions. By repurposing the diffusion framework with multivariate Student-t distributions, I developed t-EDM and t-Flow, which significantly enhance heavy-tail estimation and outperform standard models in generating rare events.\n\nI am also passionate about improving the efficiency of generative models. My work on Conditional Conjugate Integrators and Reduced Splitting Integrators has led to substantial reductions in sampling steps for inverse problems, achieving high-quality results with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, I have explored the integration of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) within diffusion frameworks, resulting in models like DiffuseVAE and VAEDM that combine the strengths of both approaches, offering low-dimensional latent spaces while maintaining high sample quality.\n\nBeyond generative modeling, I have ventured into trajectory inference in single-cell RNA-seq data with MARGARET, a method that leverages deep metric learning to reconstruct complex cellular dynamics. This work has not only advanced our understanding of cell fate plasticity but has also provided insights into previously uncharacterized cell types and branching events.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to push the boundaries of generative AI, making it more robust, efficient, and applicable across diverse real-world scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a Fast Diffusion Model (FDM) to significantly speed up DMs from a stochastic optimization perspective for both faster training and sampling. We first find that the diffusion process of DMs accords with the stochastic optimization process of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a stochastic time-variant problem. Then, inspired by momentum SGD that uses both gradient and an extra momentum to achieve faster and more stable convergence than SGD, we integrate momentum into the diffusion process of DMs. This comes with a unique challenge of deriving the noise perturbation kernel from the momentum-based diffusion process. To this end, we frame the process as a Damped Oscillation system whose critically damped state -- the kernel solution -- avoids oscillation and yields a faster convergence speed of the diffusion process. Empirical results show that our FDM can be applied to several popular DM frameworks, e.g., VP, VE, and EDM, and reduces their training cost by about 50% with comparable image synthesis performance on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and AFHQv2 datasets. Moreover, FDM decreases their sampling steps by about 3x to achieve similar performance under the same samplers. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/FDM.\n2th cited abstract: The immense scale of the recent large language models (LLM) allows many interesting properties, such as, instruction- and chain-of-thought-based fine-tuning, that has significantly improved zero- and few-shot performance in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Inspired by such successes, we adopt such an instruction-tuned LLM Flan-T5 as the text encoder for text-to-audio (TTA) generation -- a task where the goal is to generate an audio from its textual description. The prior works on TTA either pre-trained a joint text-audio encoder or used a non-instruction-tuned model, such as, T5. Consequently, our latent diffusion model (LDM)-based approach TANGO outperforms the state-of-the-art AudioLDM on most metrics and stays comparable on the rest on AudioCaps test set, despite training the LDM on a 63 times smaller dataset and keeping the text encoder frozen. This improvement might also be attributed to the adoption of audio pressure level-based sound mixing for training set augmentation, whereas the prior methods take a random mix.\n3th cited abstract: Despite its success in image synthesis, we observe that diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) often lack contextual reasoning ability to learn the relations among object parts in an image, leading to a slow learning process. To solve this issue, we propose a Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT) that introduces a mask latent modeling scheme to explicitly enhance the DPMs\u2019 ability to contextual relation learning among object semantic parts in an image. During training, MDT operates in the latent space to mask certain tokens. Then, an asymmetric masking diffusion transformer is designed to predict masked tokens from unmasked ones while maintaining the diffusion generation process. Our MDT can reconstruct the full information of an image from its incomplete contextual input, thus enabling it to learn the associated relations among image tokens. Experimental results show that MDT achieves superior image synthesis performance, e.g., a new SOTA FID score in the ImageNet data set, and has about 3\u00d7 faster learning speed than the previous SOTA DiT. The source code is released at https://github.com/sail-sg/MDT.\n4th cited abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the fields of image, audio, and video generation, but they depend on an iterative sampling process that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, we propose consistency models, a new family of models that generate high quality samples by directly mapping noise to data. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation. When trained in isolation, consistency models become a new family of generative models that can outperform existing one-step, non-adversarial generative models on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN 256x256.\n5th cited abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated a very promising ability in high-resolution image synthesis. However, sampling from a pre-trained DPM is time-consuming due to the multiple evaluations of the denoising network, making it more and more important to accelerate the sampling of DPMs. Despite recent progress in designing fast samplers, existing methods still cannot generate satisfying images in many applications where fewer steps (e.g., $<$10) are favored. In this paper, we develop a unified corrector (UniC) that can be applied after any existing DPM sampler to increase the order of accuracy without extra model evaluations, and derive a unified predictor (UniP) that supports arbitrary order as a byproduct. Combining UniP and UniC, we propose a unified predictor-corrector framework called UniPC for the fast sampling of DPMs, which has a unified analytical form for any order and can significantly improve the sampling quality over previous methods, especially in extremely few steps. We evaluate our methods through extensive experiments including both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. Our UniPC can achieve 3.87 FID on CIFAR10 (unconditional) and 7.51 FID on ImageNet 256$\\times$256 (conditional) with only 10 function evaluations. Code is available at https://github.com/wl-zhao/UniPC.\n6th cited abstract: Guided diffusion is a technique for conditioning the output of a diffusion model at sampling time without retraining the network for each specific task. One drawback of diffusion models, however, is their slow sampling process. Recent techniques can accelerate unguided sampling by applying high-order numerical methods to the sampling process when viewed as differential equations. On the contrary, we discover that the same techniques do not work for guided sampling, and little has been explored about its acceleration. This paper explores the culprit of this problem and provides a solution based on operator splitting methods, motivated by our key finding that classical high-order numerical methods are unsuitable for the conditional function. Our proposed method can re-utilize the high-order methods for guided sampling and can generate images with the same quality as a 250-step DDIM baseline using 32-58% less sampling time on ImageNet256. We also demonstrate usage on a wide variety of conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation, colorization, inpainting, and super-resolution.\n7th cited abstract: We explore a new class of diffusion models based on the transformer architecture. We train latent diffusion models of images, replacing the commonly-used U-Net backbone with a transformer that operates on latent patches. We analyze the scalability of our Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of forward pass complexity as measured by Gflops. We find that DiTs with higher Gflops\u2014through increased transformer depth/width or increased number of input tokens\u2014consistently have lower FID. In addition to possessing good scalability properties, our largest DiT-XL/2 models outperform all prior diffusion models on the class-conditional ImageNet 512\u00d7512 and 256\u00d7256 benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art FID of 2.27 on the latter.\n8th cited abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in high-resolution image synthesis, especially in recent large-scale text-to-image generation applications. An essential technique for improving the sample quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100 to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance, their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from instability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++ solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.\n9th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative models. A forward diffusion process slowly perturbs the data, while a deep model learns to gradually denoise. Synthesis amounts to solving a differential equation (DE) defined by the learnt model. Solving the DE requires slow iterative solvers for high-quality generation. In this work, we propose Higher-Order Denoising Diffusion Solvers (GENIE): Based on truncated Taylor methods, we derive a novel higher-order solver that significantly accelerates synthesis. Our solver relies on higher-order gradients of the perturbed data distribution, that is, higher-order score functions. In practice, only Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) are required and we propose to extract them from the first-order score network via automatic differentiation. We then distill the JVPs into a separate neural network that allows us to efficiently compute the necessary higher-order terms for our novel sampler during synthesis. We only need to train a small additional head on top of the first-order score network. We validate GENIE on multiple image generation benchmarks and demonstrate that GENIE outperforms all previous solvers. Unlike recent methods that fundamentally alter the generation process in DDMs, our GENIE solves the true generative DE and still enables applications such as encoding and guided sampling.

The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that the procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification, turns an arbitrary coupling of \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively applying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with a single Euler discretization step.\n11th cited abstract: Large text-to-image models achieved a remarkable leap in the evolution of AI, enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt. However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for \u201cpersonalization\u201d of text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the subject's key features. We also provide a new dataset and evaluation protocol for this new task of subject-driven generation. Project page: https://dreambooth.github.io/\n12th cited abstract: Text-to-image models offer unprecedented freedom to guide creation through natural language. Yet, it is unclear how such freedom can be exercised to generate images of specific unique concepts, modify their appearance, or compose them in new roles and novel scenes. In other words, we ask: how can we use language-guided models to turn our cat into a painting, or imagine a new product based on our favorite toy? Here we present a simple approach that allows such creative freedom. Using only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept, like an object or a style, we learn to represent it through new\"words\"in the embedding space of a frozen text-to-image model. These\"words\"can be composed into natural language sentences, guiding personalized creation in an intuitive way. Notably, we find evidence that a single word embedding is sufficient for capturing unique and varied concepts. We compare our approach to a wide range of baselines, and demonstrate that it can more faithfully portray the concepts across a range of applications and tasks. Our code, data and new words will be available at: https://textual-inversion.github.io\n13th cited abstract: Classifier guidance is a recently introduced method to trade off mode coverage and sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models post training, in the same spirit as low temperature sampling or truncation in other types of generative models. Classifier guidance combines the score estimate of a diffusion model with the gradient of an image classifier and thereby requires training an image classifier separate from the diffusion model. It also raises the question of whether guidance can be performed without a classifier. We show that guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a classifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier guidance.\n14th cited abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel guided diffusion purification approach to provide a strong defense against adversarial attacks. Our model achieves 89.62% robust accuracy under PGD-L_inf attack (eps = 8/255) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We first explore the essential correlations between unguided diffusion models and randomized smoothing, enabling us to apply the models to certified robustness. The empirical results show that our models outperform randomized smoothing by 5% when the certified L2 radius r is larger than 0.5.\n15th cited abstract: Our goal is to extend the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to general diffusion models~(DMs) besides isotropic diffusions. Instead of constructing a non-Markov noising process as in the original DDIM, we examine the mechanism of DDIM from a numerical perspective. We discover that the DDIM can be obtained by using some specific approximations of the score when solving the corresponding stochastic differential equation. We present an interpretation of the accelerating effects of DDIM that also explains the advantages of a deterministic sampling scheme over the stochastic one for fast sampling. Building on this insight, we extend DDIM to general DMs, coined generalized DDIM (gDDIM), with a small but delicate modification in parameterizing the score network. We validate gDDIM in two non-isotropic DMs: Blurring diffusion model (BDM) and Critically-damped Langevin diffusion model (CLD). We observe more than 20 times acceleration in BDM. In the CLD, a diffusion model by augmenting the diffusion process with velocity, our algorithm achieves an FID score of 2.26, on CIFAR10, with only 50 number of score function evaluations~(NFEs) and an FID score of 2.86 with only 27 NFEs. Code is available at https://github.com/qsh-zh/gDDIM\n16th cited abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are emerging powerful generative models. Despite their high-quality generation performance, DPMs still suffer from their slow sampling as they generally need hundreds or thousands of sequential function evaluations (steps) of large neural networks to draw a sample. Sampling from DPMs can be viewed alternatively as solving the corresponding diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this work, we propose an exact formulation of the solution of diffusion ODEs. The formulation analytically computes the linear part of the solution, rather than leaving all terms to black-box ODE solvers as adopted in previous works. By applying change-of-variable, the solution can be equivalently simplified to an exponentially weighted integral of the neural network. Based on our formulation, we propose DPM-Solver, a fast dedicated high-order solver for diffusion ODEs with the convergence order guarantee. DPM-Solver is suitable for both discrete-time and continuous-time DPMs without any further training. Experimental results show that DPM-Solver can generate high-quality samples in only 10 to 20 function evaluations on various datasets. We achieve 4.70 FID in 10 function evaluations and 2.87 FID in 20 function evaluations on the CIFAR10 dataset, and a $4\\sim 16\\times$ speedup compared with previous state-of-the-art training-free samplers on various datasets.\n17th cited abstract: We argue that the theory and practice of diffusion-based generative models are currently unnecessarily convoluted and seek to remedy the situation by presenting a design space that clearly separates the concrete design choices. This lets us identify several changes to both the sampling and training processes, as well as preconditioning of the score networks. Together, our improvements yield new state-of-the-art FID of 1.79 for CIFAR-10 in a class-conditional setting and 1.97 in an unconditional setting, with much faster sampling (35 network evaluations per image) than prior designs. To further demonstrate their modular nature, we show that our design changes dramatically improve both the efficiency and quality obtainable with pre-trained score networks from previous work, including improving the FID of a previously trained ImageNet-64 model from 2.07 to near-SOTA 1.55, and after re-training with our proposed improvements to a new SOTA of 1.36.\n18th cited abstract: With wider application of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various algorithms and frameworks, security threats have become one of the concerns. Adversarial attacks disturb DNN-based image classifiers, in which attackers can intentionally add imperceptible adversarial perturbations on input images to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel purification approach, referred to as guided diffusion model for purification (GDMP), to help protect classifiers from adversarial attacks. The core of our approach is to embed purification into the diffusion denoising process of a Denoised Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), so that its diffusion process could submerge the adversarial perturbations with gradually added Gaussian noises, and both of these noises can be simultaneously removed following a guided denoising process. On our comprehensive experiments across various datasets, the proposed GDMP is shown to reduce the perturbations raised by adversarial attacks to a shallow range, thereby significantly improving the correctness of classification. GDMP improves the robust accuracy by 5%, obtaining 90.1% under PGD attack on the CIFAR10 dataset. Moreover, GDMP achieves 70.94% robustness on the challenging ImageNet dataset.\n19th cited abstract: The past few years have witnessed the great success of Diffusion models~(DMs) in generating high-fidelity samples in generative modeling tasks. A major limitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally requires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned diffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast sampling method for DMs with a much less number of steps while retaining high sample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure in DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the method of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned diffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler~(DEIS). It is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages a semilinear structure of the learned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed method can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as few as 10 steps. In our experiments, it takes about 3 minutes on one A6000 GPU to generate $50k$ images from CIFAR10. Moreover, by directly using pre-trained DMs, we achieve the state-of-art sampling performance when the number of score function evaluation~(NFE) is limited, e.g., 4.17 FID with 10 NFEs, 3.37 FID, and 9.74 IS with only 15 NFEs on CIFAR10. Code is available at https://github.com/qsh-zh/deis\n20th cited abstract: Common image-to-image translation methods rely on joint training over data from both source and target domains. The training process requires concurrent access to both datasets, which hinders data separation and privacy protection; and existing models cannot be easily adapted for translation of new domain pairs. We present Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIBs), an image translation method based on diffusion models, that circumvents training on domain pairs. Image translation with DDIBs relies on two diffusion models trained independently on each domain, and is a two-step process: DDIBs first obtain latent encodings for source images with the source diffusion model, and then decode such encodings using the target model to construct target images. Both steps are defined via ordinary differential equations (ODEs), thus the process is cycle consistent only up to discretization errors of the ODE solvers. Theoretically, we interpret DDIBs as concatenation of source to latent, and latent to target Schrodinger Bridges, a form of entropy-regularized optimal transport, to explain the efficacy of the method. Experimentally, we apply DDIBs on synthetic and high-resolution image datasets, to demonstrate their utility in a wide variety of translation tasks and their inherent optimal transport properties.\n21th cited abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high-quality samples such as image and audio samples. However, DDPMs require hundreds to thousands of iterations to produce final samples. Several prior works have successfully accelerated DDPMs through adjusting the variance schedule (e.g., Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) or the denoising equation (e.g., Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs)). However, these acceleration methods cannot maintain the quality of samples and even introduce new noise at a high speedup rate, which limit their practicability. To accelerate the inference process while keeping the sample quality, we provide a fresh perspective that DDPMs should be treated as solving differential equations on manifolds. Under such a perspective, we propose pseudo numerical methods for diffusion models (PNDMs). Specifically, we figure out how to solve differential equations on manifolds and show that DDIMs are simple cases of pseudo numerical methods. We change several classical numerical methods to corresponding pseudo numerical methods and find that the pseudo linear multi-step method is the best in most situations. According to our experiments, by directly using pre-trained models on Cifar10, CelebA and LSUN, PNDMs can generate higher quality synthetic images with only 50 steps compared with 1000-step DDIMs (20x speedup), significantly outperform DDIMs with 250 steps (by around 0.4 in FID) and have good generalization on different variance schedules. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/luping-liu/PNDM.\n22th cited abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as an expressive family of generative models rivaling GANs in sample quality and autoregressive models in likelihood scores. Standard diffusion models typically require hundreds of forward passes through the model to generate a single high-fidelity sample. We introduce Differentiable Diffusion Sampler Search (DDSS): a method that optimizes fast samplers for any pre-trained diffusion model by differentiating through sample quality scores. We also present Generalized Gaussian Diffusion Models (GGDM), a family of flexible non-Markovian samplers for diffusion models. We show that optimizing the degrees of freedom of GGDM samplers by maximizing sample quality scores via gradient descent leads to improved sample quality. Our optimization procedure backpropagates through the sampling process using the reparametrization trick and gradient rematerialization. DDSS achieves strong results on unconditional image generation across various datasets (e.g., FID scores on LSUN church 128x128 of 11.6 with only 10 inference steps, and 4.82 with 20 steps, compared to 51.1 and 14.9 with strongest DDPM/DDIM baselines). Our method is compatible with any pre-trained diffusion model without fine-tuning or re-training required.\n23th cited abstract: By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.\n24th cited abstract: Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.\n25th cited abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise. The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered \u201cvelocities\u201d that are coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data, an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new sampling scheme for ef\ufb01cient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We \ufb01nd that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel sampler for CLD signi\ufb01cantly outperforms solvers such as Euler\u2013Maruyama. Our framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. VPSDE. We leave the study of CLD with maximum likelihood training for high-dimensional (image) datasets to future work.\n26th cited abstract: We propose heavy ball neural ordinary differential equations (HBNODEs), leveraging the continuous limit of the classical momentum accelerated gradient descent, to improve neural ODEs (NODEs) training and inference. HBNODEs have two properties that imply practical advantages over NODEs: (i) The adjoint state of an HBNODE also satisfies an HBNODE, accelerating both forward and backward ODE solvers, thus significantly reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) and improving the utility of the trained models. (ii) The spectrum of HBNODEs is well structured, enabling effective learning of long-term dependencies from complex sequential data. We verify the advantages of HBNODEs over NODEs on benchmark tasks, including image classification, learning complex dynamics, and sequential modeling. Our method requires remarkably fewer forward and backward NFEs, is more accurate, and learns long-term dependencies more effectively than the other ODE-based neural network models. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/hedixia/HeavyBallNODE}.\n27th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have shown remarkable performance in unconditional image generation. However, due to the stochasticity of the generative process in DDPM, it is challenging to generate images with the desired semantics. In this work, we propose Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to generate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The controllability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any additional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from various downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image, and editing with scribbles.\n28th cited abstract: An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n29th cited abstract: Recently, numerous facial editing techniques have been proposed that leverage the generative power of a pretrained StyleGAN. To successfully edit an image this way, one must first project (or invert) the image into the pretrained generator\u2019s domain. As it turns out, StyleGAN\u2019s latent space induces an inherent tradeoff between distortion and editability, i.e., between maintaining the original appearance and convincingly altering its attributes. Hence, it remains challenging to apply ID-preserving edits to real facial images. In this article, we present an approach to bridge this gap. The idea is Pivotal Tuning\u2014a brief training process that preserves editing quality, while surgically changing the portrayed identity and appearance. In Pivotal Tuning Inversion, an initial inverted latent code serves as a pivot, around which the generator is fine-tuned. At the same time, a regularization term keeps nearby identities intact, to locally contain the effect. We further show that Pivotal Tuning also applies to accommodating for a multitude of faces, while introducing negligible distortion on the rest of the domain. We validate our technique through inversion and editing metrics and show preferable scores to state-of-the-art methods. Last, we present successful editing for harder cases, including elaborate make-up or headwear.\n30th cited abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as a powerful family of generative models that can yield high-fidelity samples and competitive log-likelihoods across a range of domains, including image and speech synthesis. Key advantages of DDPMs include ease of training, in contrast to generative adversarial networks, and speed of generation, in contrast to autoregressive models. However, DDPMs typically require hundreds-to-thousands of steps to generate a high fidelity sample, making them prohibitively expensive for high dimensional problems. Fortunately, DDPMs allow trading generation speed for sample quality through adjusting the number of refinement steps as a post process. Prior work has been successful in improving generation speed through handcrafting the time schedule by trial and error. We instead view the selection of the inference time schedules as an optimization problem, and introduce an exact dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal discrete time schedules for any pre-trained DDPM. Our method exploits the fact that ELBO can be decomposed into separate KL terms, and given any computation budget, discovers the time schedule that maximizes the training ELBO exactly. Our method is efficient, has no hyper-parameters of its own, and can be applied to any pre-trained DDPM with no retraining. We discover inference time schedules requiring as few as 32 refinement steps, while sacrificing less than 0.1 bits per dimension compared to the default 4,000 steps used on ImageNet 64x64 [Ho et al., 2020; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021].\n31th cited abstract: Progressively applying Gaussian noise transforms complex data distributions to approximately Gaussian. Reversing this dynamic defines a generative model. When the forward noising process is given by a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), Song et al. (2021) demonstrate how the time inhomogeneous drift of the associated reverse-time SDE may be estimated using score-matching. A limitation of this approach is that the forward-time SDE must be run for a sufficiently long time for the final distribution to be approximately Gaussian. In contrast, solving the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge problem (SB), i.e. an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem on path spaces, yields diffusions which generate samples from the data distribution in finite time. We present Diffusion SB (DSB), an original approximation of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to solve the SB problem, and provide theoretical analysis along with generative modeling experiments. The first DSB iteration recovers the methodology proposed by Song et al. (2021), with the flexibility of using shorter time intervals, as subsequent DSB iterations reduce the discrepancy between the final-time marginal of the forward (resp. backward) SDE with respect to the prior (resp. data) distribution. Beyond generative modeling, DSB offers a widely applicable computational optimal transport tool as the continuous state-space analogue of the popular Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi, 2013).\n32th cited abstract: We show that diffusion models can achieve image sample quality superior to the current state-of-the-art generative models. We achieve this on unconditional image synthesis by finding a better architecture through a series of ablations. For conditional image synthesis, we further improve sample quality with classifier guidance: a simple, compute-efficient method for trading off diversity for fidelity using gradients from a classifier. We achieve an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet 128$\\times$128, 4.59 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256, and 7.72 on ImageNet 512$\\times$512, and we match BigGAN-deep even with as few as 25 forward passes per sample, all while maintaining better coverage of the distribution. Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256 and 3.85 on ImageNet 512$\\times$512. We release our code at https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion\n33th cited abstract: We propose a novel unpaired image-to-image translation method that uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models without requiring adversarial training. Our method, UNpaired Image Translation with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (UNIT-DDPM), trains a generative model to infer the joint distribution of images over both domains as a Markov chain by minimising a denoising score matching objective conditioned on the other domain. In particular, we update both domain translation models simultaneously, and we generate target domain images by a denoising Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach that is conditioned on the input source domain images, based on Langevin dynamics. Our approach provides stable model training for image-to-image translation and generates high-quality image outputs. This enables state-of-the-art Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) performance on several public datasets, including both colour and multispectral imagery, significantly outperforming the contemporary adversarial image-to-image translation methods.\n34th cited abstract: State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.\n35th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution. Finally, we show that the sample quality and likelihood of these models scale smoothly with model capacity and training compute, making them easily scalable. We release our code at https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion\n36th cited abstract: Iterative generative models, such as noise conditional score networks and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, produce high quality samples by gradually denoising an initial noise vector. However, their denoising process has many steps, making them 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than other generative models such as GANs and VAEs. In this paper, we establish a novel connection between knowledge distillation and image generation with a technique that distills a multi-step denoising process into a single step, resulting in a sampling speed similar to other single-step generative models. Our Denoising Student generates high quality samples comparable to GANs on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets, without adversarial training. We demonstrate that our method scales to higher resolutions through experiments on 256 x 256 LSUN. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tcl9876/Denoising_Student\n37th cited abstract: Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\\aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.\n38th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved high quality image generation without adversarial training, yet they require simulating a Markov chain for many steps to produce a sample. To accelerate sampling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more efficient class of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as DDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is defined as the reverse of a Markovian diffusion process. We construct a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that lead to the same training objective, but whose reverse process can be much faster to sample from. We empirically demonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples $10 \\times$ to $50 \\times$ faster in terms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation for sample quality, and can perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly in the latent space.\n39th cited abstract: We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN. Our implementation is available at this https URL\n40th cited abstract: Score-based generative models can produce high quality image samples comparable to GANs, without requiring adversarial optimization. However, existing training procedures are limited to images of low resolution (typically below 32x32), and can be unstable under some settings. We provide a new theoretical analysis of learning and sampling from score models in high dimensional spaces, explaining existing failure modes and motivating new solutions that generalize across datasets. To enhance stability, we also propose to maintain an exponential moving average of model weights. With these improvements, we can effortlessly scale score-based generative models to images with unprecedented resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 256x256. Our score-based models can generate high-fidelity samples that rival best-in-class GANs on various image datasets, including CelebA, FFHQ, and multiple LSUN categories.\n41th cited abstract: Designing deep neural networks is an art that often involves an expensive search over candidate architectures. To overcome this for recurrent neural nets (RNNs), we establish a connection between the hidden state dynamics in an RNN and gradient descent (GD). We then integrate momentum into this framework and propose a new family of RNNs, called {\\em MomentumRNNs}. We theoretically prove and numerically demonstrate that MomentumRNNs alleviate the vanishing gradient issue in training RNNs. We study the momentum long-short term memory (MomentumLSTM) and verify its advantages in convergence speed and accuracy over its LSTM counterpart across a variety of benchmarks, with little compromise in computational or memory efficiency. We also demonstrate that MomentumRNN is applicable to many types of recurrent cells, including those in the state-of-the-art orthogonal RNNs. Finally, we show that other advanced momentum-based optimization methods, such as Adam and Nesterov accelerated gradients with a restart, can be easily incorporated into the MomentumRNN framework for designing new recurrent cells with even better performance.

We present an evaluation metric that can separately and reliably measure both of these aspects in image generation tasks by forming explicit, non-parametric representations of the manifolds of real and generated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metric in StyleGAN and BigGAN by providing several illustrative examples where existing metrics yield uninformative or contradictory results. Furthermore, we analyze multiple design variants of StyleGAN to better understand the relationships between the model architecture, training methods, and the properties of the resulting sample distribution. In the process, we identify new variants that improve the state-of-the-art. We also perform the first principled analysis of truncation methods and identify an improved method. Finally, we extend our metric to estimate the perceptual quality of individual samples, and use this to study latent space interpolations.\n43th cited abstract: \n44th cited abstract: Deep neural networks have been one of the dominant machine learning approaches in recent years. Several new network structures are proposed and have better performance than the traditional feedforward neural network structure. Representative ones include the skip connection structure in ResNet and the dense connection structure in DenseNet. However, it still lacks a unified guidance for the neural network structure design. In this paper, we propose the hypothesis that the neural network structure design can be inspired by optimization algorithms and a faster optimization algorithm may lead to a better neural network structure. Specifically, we prove that the propagation in the feedforward neural network with the same linear transformation in different layers is equivalent to minimizing some function using the gradient descent algorithm. Based on this observation, we replace the gradient descent algorithm with the heavy ball algorithm and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent algorithm, which are faster and inspire us to design new and better network structures. ResNet and DenseNet can be considered as two special cases of our framework. Numerical experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet verify the advantage of our optimization algorithm inspired structures over ResNet and DenseNet.\n45th cited abstract: Momentum is a simple and widely used trick which allows gradient-based optimizers to pick up speed along low curvature directions. Its performance depends crucially on a damping coefficient $\\beta$. Large $\\beta$ values can potentially deliver much larger speedups, but are prone to oscillations and instability; hence one typically resorts to small values such as 0.5 or 0.9. We propose Aggregated Momentum (AggMo), a variant of momentum which combines multiple velocity vectors with different $\\beta$ parameters. AggMo is trivial to implement, but significantly dampens oscillations, enabling it to remain stable even for aggressive $\\beta$ values such as 0.999. We reinterpret Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent as a special case of AggMo and analyze rates of convergence for quadratic objectives. Empirically, we find that AggMo is a suitable drop-in replacement for other momentum methods, and frequently delivers faster convergence.\n46th cited abstract: While it is nearly effortless for humans to quickly assess the perceptual similarity between two images, the underlying processes are thought to be quite complex. Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual losses\"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.\n47th cited abstract: Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed in Gregor and Le Cun (2010), which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately. \nIn this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.\n48th cited abstract: Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders a content image in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer. However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color & spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.\n49th cited abstract: We investigate the long time behavior of solutions to the differential equation $\\ddot{x}(t)+\\frac{c}{\\left( t+1\\right) ^{\\alpha}}\\dot{x}(t)+\\nabla \\Phi\\left( x(t)\\right) =g(t),~t\\geq0, $ where $c$ is nonnegative constant, $\\alpha\\in\\lbrack0,1[,$ $\\Phi$ is a $C^{1}$ convex function on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ and $g\\in L^{1} (0,+\\infty;\\mathcal{H}).$ We obtain sufficient conditions on the source term $g(t)$ ensuring the weak or the strong convergence of any trajectory $x(t)$ as $t\\rightarrow+\\infty$ to a minimizer of the function $\\Phi$ if one exists.\n50th cited abstract: Plain gradient descent (2:1) Stepsize and step direction as core issues (2:2) Stepsize adaptation (2:4) Backtracking (2:5) Line search (2:5) Wolfe conditions (2:7) Gradient descent convergence (2:8) Steepest descent direction (2:11) Covariant gradient descent (2:13) Newton direction (2:14) Newton method (2:15) Gauss-Newton method (2:20) Quasi-Newton methods (2:23) Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) (2:25) Conjugate gradient (2:28) Rprop (2:35)\n51th cited abstract: We propose a new method for unconstrained optimization of a smooth and strongly convex function, which attains the optimal rate of convergence of Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient descent. The new algorithm has a simple geometric interpretation, loosely inspired by the ellipsoid method. We provide some numerical evidence that the new method can be superior to Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient descent.\n52th cited abstract: We derive a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is the limit of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. This ODE exhibits approximate equivalence to Nesterov's scheme and thus can serve as a tool for analysis. We show that the continuous time ODE allows for a better understanding of Nesterov's scheme. As a byproduct, we obtain a family of schemes with similar convergence rates. The ODE interpretation also suggests restarting Nesterov's scheme leading to an algorithm, which can be rigorously proven to converge at a linear rate whenever the objective is strongly convex.\n53th cited abstract: \n54th cited abstract: This manuscript develops a new framework to analyze and design iterative optimization algorithms built on the notion of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC) from robust control theory. IQCs provide sufficient conditions for the stability of complicated interconnected systems, and these conditions can be checked by semidefinite programming. We discuss how to adapt IQC theory to study optimization algorithms, proving new inequalities about convex functions and providing a version of IQC theory adapted for use by optimization researchers. Using these inequalities, we derive numerical upper bounds on convergence rates for the gradient method, the heavy-ball method, Nesterov's accelerated method, and related variants by solving small, simple semidefinite programming problems. We also briefly show how these techniques can be used to search for optimization algorithms with desired performance characteristics, establishing a new methodology for algorithm design.\n55th cited abstract: First-order methods play a central role in large-scale machine learning. Even though many variations exist, each suited to a particular problem, almost all such methods fundamentally rely on two types of algorithmic steps: gradient descent, which yields primal progress, and mirror descent, which yields dual progress. \nWe observe that the performances of gradient and mirror descent are complementary, so that faster algorithms can be designed by LINEARLY COUPLING the two. We show how to reconstruct Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods using linear coupling, which gives a cleaner interpretation than Nesterov's original proofs. We also discuss the power of linear coupling by extending it to many other settings that Nesterov's methods cannot apply to.\n56th cited abstract: \n57th cited abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) utilizes the sparsity of magnetic resonance (MR) images to enable accurate reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. Recent CS methods have employed analytical sparsifying transforms such as wavelets, curvelets, and finite differences. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the sparsifying transform (dictionary), and reconstructing the image simultaneously from highly undersampled k-space data. The sparsity in this framework is enforced on overlapping image patches emphasizing local structure. Moreover, the dictionary is adapted to the particular image instance thereby favoring better sparsities and consequently much higher undersampling rates. The proposed alternating reconstruction algorithm learns the sparsifying dictionary, and uses it to remove aliasing and noise in one step, and subsequently restores and fills-in the k-space data in the other step. Numerical experiments are conducted on MR images and on real MR data of several anatomies with a variety of sampling schemes. The results demonstrate dramatic improvements on the order of 4-18 dB in reconstruction error and doubling of the acceptable undersampling factor using the proposed adaptive dictionary as compared to previous CS methods. These improvements persist over a wide range of practical data signal-to-noise ratios, without any parameter tuning.\n58th cited abstract: \n59th cited abstract: \n60th cited abstract: Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu//spl sim/lcv/ssim/.\n61th cited abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior at infinity of solutions of a second order evolution equation with linear damping and convex potential. The differential system is defined in a real Hilbert space. It is proved that if the potential is bounded from below, then the solution trajectories are minimizing for it and converge weakly towards a minimizer of $\\Phi$ if one exists; this convergence is strong when $\\Phi$ is even or when the optimal set has a nonempty interior. We introduce a second order proximal-like iterative algorithm for the minimization of a convex function. It is defined by an implicit discretization of the continuous evolution problem and is valid for any closed proper convex function. We find conditions on some parameters of the algorithm in order to have a convergence result similar to the continuous case.\n62th cited abstract: Let H be a real Hilbert space and \u03a6:H \u21a6 R a continuously differentiable function, whose gradient is Lipschitz continuous on bounded sets. We study the nonlinear dissipative dynamical system: ${\\ddot x}(t)+\\lambda{\\dot x}(t)+\\nabla\\Phi(x(t))=0, \\lambda>0, plus Cauchy data, mainly in view of the unconstrained minimization of the function \u03a6. New results concerning the convergence of a solution to a critical point are given in various situations, including when \u03a6 is convex (possibly with multiple minima) or is a Morse function (the critical point being then generically a local minimum); a counterexample shows that, without peculiar assumptions, a trajectory may not converge. By following the trajectories, we obtain a method for exploring local minima of \u03a6. A singular perturbation analysis links our results with those concerning gradient systems.\n63th cited abstract: \n64th cited abstract: We propose the Nesterov neural ordinary differential equations (NesterovNODEs), whose layers solve the second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) limit of Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient (NAG) method, and a generalization called GNesterovNODEs. Taking the advantage of the convergence rate O (1 /k 2 ) of the NAG scheme, GNesterovNODEs speed up training and inference by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) needed to solve the ODEs. We also prove that the adjoint state of a GNesterovNODEs also satisfies a GNesterovNODEs, thus accelerating both forward and backward ODE solvers and allowing the model to be scaled up for large-scale tasks. We empirically corroborate the advantage of GNesterovNODEs on a wide range of practical applications, including point cloud separation, image classification, and sequence modeling. Compared to NODEs, GNesterovNODEs require a significantly smaller number of NFEs while achieving better accuracy across our experiments.\n65th cited abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been attracting attention recently as a new challenger to popular deep neural generative models including GAN, VAE, etc. However, DDPMs have a disadvantage that they often require a huge number of re\ufb01nement steps during the synthesis. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new DDPM sampler based on a second-order numerical scheme for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), while the conventional sampler is based on a \ufb01rst-order numerical scheme. In general, it is not easy to compute the derivatives that are required in higher-order numerical schemes. However, in the case of DDPM, this dif\ufb01culty is alleviated by the trick which the authors call \u201c ideal derivative substitution \u201d. The newly derived higher-order sampler was applied to both image and speech generation tasks, and it is experimentally observed that the proposed sampler could synthesize plausible images and audio signals in relatively smaller number of re\ufb01nement steps.\n66th cited abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) is a challenging task due to the need for an individual\u2019s potential outcomes to be learned from biased data and without having access to the counterfactuals. We propose a novel method for inferring ITE based on the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) framework. Our method, termed Generative Adversarial Nets for inference of Individualized Treatment Effects (GANITE), is motivated by the possibility that we can capture the uncertainty in the counterfactual distributions by attempting to learn them using a GAN. We generate proxies of the counterfactual outcomes using a counterfactual generator, G, and then pass these proxies to an ITE generator, I, in order to train it. By modeling both of these using the GAN framework, we are able to infer based on the factual data, while still accounting for the unseen counterfactuals. We test our method on three real-world datasets (with both binary and multiple treatments) and show that GANITE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n67th cited abstract: \n68th cited abstract: \n69th cited abstract: \n70th cited abstract: \n71th cited abstract: \n\n\nPlease evaluate the submission based on the following criteria:\n\nClarity: Is the writing clear, structured, and terms defined?\nBaselines: Are baseline comparisons relevant, sufficient, and not excessive?\nNovelty: Is the approach innovative or distinct from prior work?\nResults: Are improvements significant, well-supported, and statistically robust?\nLimitations: Are weaknesses acknowledged and future work discussed?\nRelated Work: Are key references cited and connections made?\nTechnical: Are methods detailed enough for replication?\n\nPlease combine both the ideas and the experiments in the submission when evaluating it.\nWhen commenting on the experiments, refer to the exact numbers from the experiments.\n\nWrite the strength in 200 words.\n\nPlease begin writing the strength of the submission.

In this paper, we propose a Fast Diffusion Model (FDM) to significantly speed up DMs from a stochastic optimization perspective for both faster training and sampling. We first find that the diffusion process of DMs accords with the stochastic optimization process of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a stochastic time-variant problem. Then, inspired by momentum SGD that uses both gradient and an extra momentum to achieve faster and more stable convergence than SGD, we integrate momentum into the diffusion process of DMs. This comes with a unique challenge of deriving the noise perturbation kernel from the momentum-based diffusion process. To this end, we frame the process as a Damped Oscillation system whose critically damped state -- the kernel solution -- avoids oscillation and yields a faster convergence speed of the diffusion process. Empirical results show that our FDM can be applied to several popular DM frameworks, e.g., VP, VE, and EDM, and reduces their training cost by about 50% with comparable image synthesis performance on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and AFHQv2 datasets. Moreover, FDM decreases their sampling steps by about 3x to achieve similar performance under the same samplers. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/FDM.\n2th cited abstract: The immense scale of the recent large language models (LLM) allows many interesting properties, such as, instruction- and chain-of-thought-based fine-tuning, that has significantly improved zero- and few-shot performance in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Inspired by such successes, we adopt such an instruction-tuned LLM Flan-T5 as the text encoder for text-to-audio (TTA) generation -- a task where the goal is to generate an audio from its textual description. The prior works on TTA either pre-trained a joint text-audio encoder or used a non-instruction-tuned model, such as, T5. Consequently, our latent diffusion model (LDM)-based approach TANGO outperforms the state-of-the-art AudioLDM on most metrics and stays comparable on the rest on AudioCaps test set, despite training the LDM on a 63 times smaller dataset and keeping the text encoder frozen. This improvement might also be attributed to the adoption of audio pressure level-based sound mixing for training set augmentation, whereas the prior methods take a random mix.\n3th cited abstract: Despite its success in image synthesis, we observe that diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) often lack contextual reasoning ability to learn the relations among object parts in an image, leading to a slow learning process. To solve this issue, we propose a Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT) that introduces a mask latent modeling scheme to explicitly enhance the DPMs\u2019 ability to contextual relation learning among object semantic parts in an image. During training, MDT operates in the latent space to mask certain tokens. Then, an asymmetric masking diffusion transformer is designed to predict masked tokens from unmasked ones while maintaining the diffusion generation process. Our MDT can reconstruct the full information of an image from its incomplete contextual input, thus enabling it to learn the associated relations among image tokens. Experimental results show that MDT achieves superior image synthesis performance, e.g., a new SOTA FID score in the ImageNet data set, and has about 3\u00d7 faster learning speed than the previous SOTA DiT. The source code is released at https://github.com/sail-sg/MDT.\n4th cited abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the fields of image, audio, and video generation, but they depend on an iterative sampling process that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, we propose consistency models, a new family of models that generate high quality samples by directly mapping noise to data. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation. When trained in isolation, consistency models become a new family of generative models that can outperform existing one-step, non-adversarial generative models on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN 256x256.\n5th cited abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated a very promising ability in high-resolution image synthesis. However, sampling from a pre-trained DPM is time-consuming due to the multiple evaluations of the denoising network, making it more and more important to accelerate the sampling of DPMs. Despite recent progress in designing fast samplers, existing methods still cannot generate satisfying images in many applications where fewer steps (e.g., $<$10) are favored. In this paper, we develop a unified corrector (UniC) that can be applied after any existing DPM sampler to increase the order of accuracy without extra model evaluations, and derive a unified predictor (UniP) that supports arbitrary order as a byproduct. Combining UniP and UniC, we propose a unified predictor-corrector framework called UniPC for the fast sampling of DPMs, which has a unified analytical form for any order and can significantly improve the sampling quality over previous methods, especially in extremely few steps. We evaluate our methods through extensive experiments including both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. Our UniPC can achieve 3.87 FID on CIFAR10 (unconditional) and 7.51 FID on ImageNet 256$\\times$256 (conditional) with only 10 function evaluations. Code is available at https://github.com/wl-zhao/UniPC.\n6th cited abstract: Guided diffusion is a technique for conditioning the output of a diffusion model at sampling time without retraining the network for each specific task. One drawback of diffusion models, however, is their slow sampling process. Recent techniques can accelerate unguided sampling by applying high-order numerical methods to the sampling process when viewed as differential equations. On the contrary, we discover that the same techniques do not work for guided sampling, and little has been explored about its acceleration. This paper explores the culprit of this problem and provides a solution based on operator splitting methods, motivated by our key finding that classical high-order numerical methods are unsuitable for the conditional function. Our proposed method can re-utilize the high-order methods for guided sampling and can generate images with the same quality as a 250-step DDIM baseline using 32-58% less sampling time on ImageNet256. We also demonstrate usage on a wide variety of conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation, colorization, inpainting, and super-resolution.\n7th cited abstract: We explore a new class of diffusion models based on the transformer architecture. We train latent diffusion models of images, replacing the commonly-used U-Net backbone with a transformer that operates on latent patches. We analyze the scalability of our Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of forward pass complexity as measured by Gflops. We find that DiTs with higher Gflops\u2014through increased transformer depth/width or increased number of input tokens\u2014consistently have lower FID. In addition to possessing good scalability properties, our largest DiT-XL/2 models outperform all prior diffusion models on the class-conditional ImageNet 512\u00d7512 and 256\u00d7256 benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art FID of 2.27 on the latter.\n8th cited abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in high-resolution image synthesis, especially in recent large-scale text-to-image generation applications. An essential technique for improving the sample quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100 to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance, their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from instability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++ solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.\n9th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative models. A forward diffusion process slowly perturbs the data, while a deep model learns to gradually denoise. Synthesis amounts to solving a differential equation (DE) defined by the learnt model. Solving the DE requires slow iterative solvers for high-quality generation. In this work, we propose Higher-Order Denoising Diffusion Solvers (GENIE): Based on truncated Taylor methods, we derive a novel higher-order solver that significantly accelerates synthesis. Our solver relies on higher-order gradients of the perturbed data distribution, that is, higher-order score functions. In practice, only Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) are required and we propose to extract them from the first-order score network via automatic differentiation. We then distill the JVPs into a separate neural network that allows us to efficiently compute the necessary higher-order terms for our novel sampler during synthesis. We only need to train a small additional head on top of the first-order score network. We validate GENIE on multiple image generation benchmarks and demonstrate that GENIE outperforms all previous solvers. Unlike recent methods that fundamentally alter the generation process in DDMs, our GENIE solves the true generative DE and still enables applications such as encoding and guided sampling. Project page and code: https://nv-tlabs.github.io/GENIE.\n10th cited abstract: We present rectified flow, a surprisingly simple approach to learning (neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two empirically observed distributions \\pi_0 and \\pi_1, hence providing a unified solution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks involving distribution transport. The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that the procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification, turns an arbitrary coupling of \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively applying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with a single Euler discretization step.\n11th cited abstract: Large text-to-image models achieved a remarkable leap in the evolution of AI, enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt. However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for \u201cpersonalization\u201d of text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the subject's key features. We also provide a new dataset and evaluation protocol for this new task of subject-driven generation. Project page: https://dreambooth.github.io/\n12th cited abstract: Text-to-image models offer unprecedented freedom to guide creation through natural language. Yet, it is unclear how such freedom can be exercised to generate images of specific unique concepts, modify their appearance, or compose them in new roles and novel scenes. In other words, we ask: how can we use language-guided models to turn our cat into a painting, or imagine a new product based on our favorite toy? Here we present a simple approach that allows such creative freedom. Using only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept, like an object or a style, we learn to represent it through new\"words\"in the embedding space of a frozen text-to-image model. These\"words\"can be composed into natural language sentences, guiding personalized creation in an intuitive way. Notably, we find evidence that a single word embedding is sufficient for capturing unique and varied concepts. We compare our approach to a wide range of baselines, and demonstrate that it can more faithfully portray the concepts across a range of applications and tasks. Our code, data and new words will be available at: https://textual-inversion.github.io\n13th cited abstract: Classifier guidance is a recently introduced method to trade off mode coverage and sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models post training, in the same spirit as low temperature sampling or truncation in other types of generative models. Classifier guidance combines the score estimate of a diffusion model with the gradient of an image classifier and thereby requires training an image classifier separate from the diffusion model. It also raises the question of whether guidance can be performed without a classifier. We show that guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a classifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier guidance.\n14th cited abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel guided diffusion purification approach to provide a strong defense against adversarial attacks. Our model achieves 89.62% robust accuracy under PGD-L_inf attack (eps = 8/255) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We first explore the essential correlations between unguided diffusion models and randomized smoothing, enabling us to apply the models to certified robustness. The empirical results show that our models outperform randomized smoothing by 5% when the certified L2 radius r is larger than 0.5.\n15th cited abstract: Our goal is to extend the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to general diffusion models~(DMs) besides isotropic diffusions. Instead of constructing a non-Markov noising process as in the original DDIM, we examine the mechanism of DDIM from a numerical perspective. We discover that the DDIM can be obtained by using some specific approximations of the score when solving the corresponding stochastic differential equation. We present an interpretation of the accelerating effects of DDIM that also explains the advantages of a deterministic sampling scheme over the stochastic one for fast sampling. Building on this insight, we extend DDIM to general DMs, coined generalized DDIM (gDDIM), with a small but delicate modification in parameterizing the score network. We validate gDDIM in two non-isotropic DMs: Blurring diffusion model (BDM) and Critically-damped Langevin diffusion model (CLD). We observe more than 20 times acceleration in BDM. In the CLD, a diffusion model by augmenting the diffusion process with velocity, our algorithm achieves an FID score of 2.26, on CIFAR10, with only 50 number of score function evaluations~(NFEs) and an FID score of 2.86 with only 27 NFEs. Code is available at https://github.com/qsh-zh/gDDIM\n16th cited abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are emerging powerful generative models. Despite their high-quality generation performance, DPMs still suffer from their slow sampling as they generally need hundreds or thousands of sequential function evaluations (steps) of large neural networks to draw a sample. Sampling from DPMs can be viewed alternatively as solving the corresponding diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this work, we propose an exact formulation of the solution of diffusion ODEs. The formulation analytically computes the linear part of the solution, rather than leaving all terms to black-box ODE solvers as adopted in previous works. By applying change-of-variable, the solution can be equivalently simplified to an exponentially weighted integral of the neural network. Based on our formulation, we propose DPM-Solver, a fast dedicated high-order solver for diffusion ODEs with the convergence order guarantee. DPM-Solver is suitable for both discrete-time and continuous-time DPMs without any further training. Experimental results show that DPM-Solver can generate high-quality samples in only 10 to 20 function evaluations on various datasets. We achieve 4.70 FID in 10 function evaluations and 2.87 FID in 20 function evaluations on the CIFAR10 dataset, and a $4\\sim 16\\times$ speedup compared with previous state-of-the-art training-free samplers on various datasets.\n17th cited abstract: We argue that the theory and practice of diffusion-based generative models are currently unnecessarily convoluted and seek to remedy the situation by presenting a design space that clearly separates the concrete design choices. This lets us identify several changes to both the sampling and training processes, as well as preconditioning of the score networks. Together, our improvements yield new state-of-the-art FID of 1.79 for CIFAR-10 in a class-conditional setting and 1.97 in an unconditional setting, with much faster sampling (35 network evaluations per image) than prior designs. To further demonstrate their modular nature, we show that our design changes dramatically improve both the efficiency and quality obtainable with pre-trained score networks from previous work, including improving the FID of a previously trained ImageNet-64 model from 2.07 to near-SOTA 1.55, and after re-training with our proposed improvements to a new SOTA of 1.36.\n18th cited abstract: With wider application of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various algorithms and frameworks, security threats have become one of the concerns. Adversarial attacks disturb DNN-based image classifiers, in which attackers can intentionally add imperceptible adversarial perturbations on input images to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel purification approach, referred to as guided diffusion model for purification (GDMP), to help protect classifiers from adversarial attacks. The core of our approach is to embed purification into the diffusion denoising process of a Denoised Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), so that its diffusion process could submerge the adversarial perturbations with gradually added Gaussian noises, and both of these noises can be simultaneously removed following a guided denoising process. On our comprehensive experiments across various datasets, the proposed GDMP is shown to reduce the perturbations raised by adversarial attacks to a shallow range, thereby significantly improving the correctness of classification. GDMP improves the robust accuracy by 5%, obtaining 90.1% under PGD attack on the CIFAR10 dataset. Moreover, GDMP achieves 70.94% robustness on the challenging ImageNet dataset.\n19th cited abstract: The past few years have witnessed the great success of Diffusion models~(DMs) in generating high-fidelity samples in generative modeling tasks. A major limitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally requires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned diffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast sampling method for DMs with a much less number of steps while retaining high sample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure in DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the method of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned diffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler~(DEIS). It is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages a semilinear structure of the learned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed method can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as few as 10 steps. In our experiments, it takes about 3 minutes on one A6000 GPU to generate $50k$ images from CIFAR10. Moreover, by directly using pre-trained DMs, we achieve the state-of-art sampling performance when the number of score function evaluation~(NFE) is limited, e.g., 4.17 FID with 10 NFEs, 3.37 FID, and 9.74 IS with only 15 NFEs on CIFAR10. Code is available at https://github.com/qsh-zh/deis\n20th cited abstract: Common image-to-image translation methods rely on joint training over data from both source and target domains. The training process requires concurrent access to both datasets, which hinders data separation and privacy protection; and existing models cannot be easily adapted for translation of new domain pairs. We present Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIBs), an image translation method based on diffusion models, that circumvents training on domain pairs. Image translation with DDIBs relies on two diffusion models trained independently on each domain, and is a two-step process: DDIBs first obtain latent encodings for source images with the source diffusion model, and then decode such encodings using the target model to construct target images. Both steps are defined via ordinary differential equations (ODEs), thus the process is cycle consistent only up to discretization errors of the ODE solvers. Theoretically, we interpret DDIBs as concatenation of source to latent, and latent to target Schrodinger Bridges, a form of entropy-regularized optimal transport, to explain the efficacy of the method. Experimentally, we apply DDIBs on synthetic and high-resolution image datasets, to demonstrate their utility in a wide variety of translation tasks and their inherent optimal transport properties.\n21th cited abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high-quality samples such as image and audio samples. However, DDPMs require hundreds to thousands of iterations to produce final samples. Several prior works have successfully accelerated DDPMs through adjusting the variance schedule (e.g., Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) or the denoising equation (e.g., Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs)). However, these acceleration methods cannot maintain the quality of samples and even introduce new noise at a high speedup rate, which limit their practicability. To accelerate the inference process while keeping the sample quality, we provide a fresh perspective that DDPMs should be treated as solving differential equations on manifolds. Under such a perspective, we propose pseudo numerical methods for diffusion models (PNDMs). Specifically, we figure out how to solve differential equations on manifolds and show that DDIMs are simple cases of pseudo numerical methods. We change several classical numerical methods to corresponding pseudo numerical methods and find that the pseudo linear multi-step method is the best in most situations. According to our experiments, by directly using pre-trained models on Cifar10, CelebA and LSUN, PNDMs can generate higher quality synthetic images with only 50 steps compared with 1000-step DDIMs (20x speedup), significantly outperform DDIMs with 250 steps (by around 0.4 in FID) and have good generalization on different variance schedules. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/luping-liu/PNDM.\n22th cited abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as an expressive family of generative models rivaling GANs in sample quality and autoregressive models in likelihood scores. Standard diffusion models typically require hundreds of forward passes through the model to generate a single high-fidelity sample. We introduce Differentiable Diffusion Sampler Search (DDSS): a method that optimizes fast samplers for any pre-trained diffusion model by differentiating through sample quality scores. We also present Generalized Gaussian Diffusion Models (GGDM), a family of flexible non-Markovian samplers for diffusion models. We show that optimizing the degrees of freedom of GGDM samplers by maximizing sample quality scores via gradient descent leads to improved sample quality. Our optimization procedure backpropagates through the sampling process using the reparametrization trick and gradient rematerialization. DDSS achieves strong results on unconditional image generation across various datasets (e.g., FID scores on LSUN church 128x128 of 11.6 with only 10 inference steps, and 4.82 with 20 steps, compared to 51.1 and 14.9 with strongest DDPM/DDIM baselines). Our method is compatible with any pre-trained diffusion model without fine-tuning or re-training required.\n23th cited abstract: By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.\n24th cited abstract: Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.\n25th cited abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise. The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered \u201cvelocities\u201d that are coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data, an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new sampling scheme for ef\ufb01cient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We \ufb01nd that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel sampler for CLD signi\ufb01cantly outperforms solvers such as Euler\u2013Maruyama. Our framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. VPSDE. We leave the study of CLD with maximum likelihood training for high-dimensional (image) datasets to future work.\n26th cited abstract: We propose heavy ball neural ordinary differential equations (HBNODEs), leveraging the continuous limit of the classical momentum accelerated gradient descent, to improve neural ODEs (NODEs) training and inference. HBNODEs have two properties that imply practical advantages over NODEs: (i) The adjoint state of an HBNODE also satisfies an HBNODE, accelerating both forward and backward ODE solvers, thus significantly reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) and improving the utility of the trained models. (ii) The spectrum of HBNODEs is well structured, enabling effective learning of long-term dependencies from complex sequential data. We verify the advantages of HBNODEs over NODEs on benchmark tasks, including image classification, learning complex dynamics, and sequential modeling. Our method requires remarkably fewer forward and backward NFEs, is more accurate, and learns long-term dependencies more effectively than the other ODE-based neural network models. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/hedixia/HeavyBallNODE}.\n27th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have shown remarkable performance in unconditional image generation. However, due to the stochasticity of the generative process in DDPM, it is challenging to generate images with the desired semantics. In this work, we propose Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to generate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The controllability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any additional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from various downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image, and editing with scribbles.\n28th cited abstract: An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n29th cited abstract: Recently, numerous facial editing techniques have been proposed that leverage the generative power of a pretrained StyleGAN. To successfully edit an image this way, one must first project (or invert) the image into the pretrained generator\u2019s domain. As it turns out, StyleGAN\u2019s latent space induces an inherent tradeoff between distortion and editability, i.e., between maintaining the original appearance and convincingly altering its attributes. Hence, it remains challenging to apply ID-preserving edits to real facial images. In this article, we present an approach to bridge this gap. The idea is Pivotal Tuning\u2014a brief training process that preserves editing quality, while surgically changing the portrayed identity and appearance. In Pivotal Tuning Inversion, an initial inverted latent code serves as a pivot, around which the generator is fine-tuned. At the same time, a regularization term keeps nearby identities intact, to locally contain the effect. We further show that Pivotal Tuning also applies to accommodating for a multitude of faces, while introducing negligible distortion on the rest of the domain. We validate our technique through inversion and editing metrics and show preferable scores to state-of-the-art methods. Last, we present successful editing for harder cases, including elaborate make-up or headwear.\n30th cited abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as a powerful family of generative models that can yield high-fidelity samples and competitive log-likelihoods across a range of domains, including image and speech synthesis. Key advantages of DDPMs include ease of training, in contrast to generative adversarial networks, and speed of generation, in contrast to autoregressive models. However, DDPMs typically require hundreds-to-thousands of steps to generate a high fidelity sample, making them prohibitively expensive for high dimensional problems. Fortunately, DDPMs allow trading generation speed for sample quality through adjusting the number of refinement steps as a post process. Prior work has been successful in improving generation speed through handcrafting the time schedule by trial and error. We instead view the selection of the inference time schedules as an optimization problem, and introduce an exact dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal discrete time schedules for any pre-trained DDPM. Our method exploits the fact that ELBO can be decomposed into separate KL terms, and given any computation budget, discovers the time schedule that maximizes the training ELBO exactly. Our method is efficient, has no hyper-parameters of its own, and can be applied to any pre-trained DDPM with no retraining. We discover inference time schedules requiring as few as 32 refinement steps, while sacrificing less than 0.1 bits per dimension compared to the default 4,000 steps used on ImageNet 64x64 [Ho et al., 2020; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021].\n31th cited abstract: Progressively applying Gaussian noise transforms complex data distributions to approximately Gaussian. Reversing this dynamic defines a generative model. When the forward noising process is given by a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), Song et al. (2021) demonstrate how the time inhomogeneous drift of the associated reverse-time SDE may be estimated using score-matching. A limitation of this approach is that the forward-time SDE must be run for a sufficiently long time for the final distribution to be approximately Gaussian. In contrast, solving the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge problem (SB), i.e. an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem on path spaces, yields diffusions which generate samples from the data distribution in finite time. We present Diffusion SB (DSB), an original approximation of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to solve the SB problem, and provide theoretical analysis along with generative modeling experiments. The first DSB iteration recovers the methodology proposed by Song et al. (2021), with the flexibility of using shorter time intervals, as subsequent DSB iterations reduce the discrepancy between the final-time marginal of the forward (resp. backward) SDE with respect to the prior (resp. data) distribution. Beyond generative modeling, DSB offers a widely applicable computational optimal transport tool as the continuous state-space analogue of the popular Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi, 2013).\n32th cited abstract: We show that diffusion models can achieve image sample quality superior to the current state-of-the-art generative models. We achieve this on unconditional image synthesis by finding a better architecture through a series of ablations. For conditional image synthesis, we further improve sample quality with classifier guidance: a simple, compute-efficient method for trading off diversity for fidelity using gradients from a classifier. We achieve an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet 128$\\times$128, 4.59 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256, and 7.72 on ImageNet 512$\\times$512, and we match BigGAN-deep even with as few as 25 forward passes per sample, all while maintaining better coverage of the distribution. Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256 and 3.85 on ImageNet 512$\\times$512. We release our code at https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion\n33th cited abstract: We propose a novel unpaired image-to-image translation method that uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models without requiring adversarial training. Our method, UNpaired Image Translation with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (UNIT-DDPM), trains a generative model to infer the joint distribution of images over both domains as a Markov chain by minimising a denoising score matching objective conditioned on the other domain. In particular, we update both domain translation models simultaneously, and we generate target domain images by a denoising Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach that is conditioned on the input source domain images, based on Langevin dynamics. Our approach provides stable model training for image-to-image translation and generates high-quality image outputs. This enables state-of-the-art Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) performance on several public datasets, including both colour and multispectral imagery, significantly outperforming the contemporary adversarial image-to-image translation methods.\n34th cited abstract: State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.\n35th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution. Finally, we show that the sample quality and likelihood of these models scale smoothly with model capacity and training compute, making them easily scalable. We release our code at https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion\n36th cited abstract: Iterative generative models, such as noise conditional score networks and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, produce high quality samples by gradually denoising an initial noise vector. However, their denoising process has many steps, making them 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than other generative models such as GANs and VAEs. In this paper, we establish a novel connection between knowledge distillation and image generation with a technique that distills a multi-step denoising process into a single step, resulting in a sampling speed similar to other single-step generative models. Our Denoising Student generates high quality samples comparable to GANs on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets, without adversarial training. We demonstrate that our method scales to higher resolutions through experiments on 256 x 256 LSUN. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tcl9876/Denoising_Student\n37th cited abstract: Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\\aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.\n38th cited abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved high quality image generation without adversarial training, yet they require simulating a Markov chain for many steps to produce a sample. To accelerate sampling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more efficient class of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as DDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is defined as the reverse of a Markovian diffusion process. We construct a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that lead to the same training objective, but whose reverse process can be much faster to sample from. We empirically demonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples $10 \\times$ to $50 \\times$ faster in terms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation for sample quality, and can perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly in the latent space.\n39th cited abstract: We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN. Our implementation is available at this https URL\n40th cited abstract: Score-based generative models can produce high quality image samples comparable to GANs, without requiring adversarial optimization. However, existing training procedures are limited to images of low resolution (typically below 32x32), and can be unstable under some settings. We provide a new theoretical analysis of learning and sampling from score models in high dimensional spaces, explaining existing failure modes and motivating new solutions that generalize across datasets. To enhance stability, we also propose to maintain an exponential moving average of model weights. With these improvements, we can effortlessly scale score-based generative models to images with unprecedented resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 256x256. Our score-based models can generate high-fidelity samples that rival best-in-class GANs on various image datasets, including CelebA, FFHQ, and multiple LSUN categories.\n41th cited abstract: Designing deep neural networks is an art that often involves an expensive search over candidate architectures. To overcome this for recurrent neural nets (RNNs), we establish a connection between the hidden state dynamics in an RNN and gradient descent (GD). We then integrate momentum into this framework and propose a new family of RNNs, called {\\em MomentumRNNs}. We theoretically prove and numerically demonstrate that MomentumRNNs alleviate the vanishing gradient issue in training RNNs. We study the momentum long-short term memory (MomentumLSTM) and verify its advantages in convergence speed and accuracy over its LSTM counterpart across a variety of benchmarks, with little compromise in computational or memory efficiency. We also demonstrate that MomentumRNN is applicable to many types of recurrent cells, including those in the state-of-the-art orthogonal RNNs. Finally, we show that other advanced momentum-based optimization methods, such as Adam and Nesterov accelerated gradients with a restart, can be easily incorporated into the MomentumRNN framework for designing new recurrent cells with even better performance. The code is available at \\url{this https URL}.\n42th cited abstract: The ability to automatically estimate the quality and coverage of the samples produced by a generative model is a vital requirement for driving algorithm research. We present an evaluation metric that can separately and reliably measure both of these aspects in image generation tasks by forming explicit, non-parametric representations of the manifolds of real and generated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metric in StyleGAN and BigGAN by providing several illustrative examples where existing metrics yield uninformative or contradictory results. Furthermore, we analyze multiple design variants of StyleGAN to better understand the relationships between the model architecture, training methods, and the properties of the resulting sample distribution. In the process, we identify new variants that improve the state-of-the-art. We also perform the first principled analysis of truncation methods and identify an improved method. Finally, we extend our metric to estimate the perceptual quality of individual samples, and use this to study latent space interpolations.\n43th cited abstract: \n44th cited abstract: Deep neural networks have been one of the dominant machine learning approaches in recent years. Several new network structures are proposed and have better performance than the traditional feedforward neural network structure. Representative ones include the skip connection structure in ResNet and the dense connection structure in DenseNet. However, it still lacks a unified guidance for the neural network structure design. In this paper, we propose the hypothesis that the neural network structure design can be inspired by optimization algorithms and a faster optimization algorithm may lead to a better neural network structure. Specifically, we prove that the propagation in the feedforward neural network with the same linear transformation in different layers is equivalent to minimizing some function using the gradient descent algorithm. Based on this observation, we replace the gradient descent algorithm with the heavy ball algorithm and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent algorithm, which are faster and inspire us to design new and better network structures. ResNet and DenseNet can be considered as two special cases of our framework. Numerical experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet verify the advantage of our optimization algorithm inspired structures over ResNet and DenseNet.\n45th cited abstract: Momentum is a simple and widely used trick which allows gradient-based optimizers to pick up speed along low curvature directions. Its performance depends crucially on a damping coefficient $\\beta$. Large $\\beta$ values can potentially deliver much larger speedups, but are prone to oscillations and instability; hence one typically resorts to small values such as 0.5 or 0.9. We propose Aggregated Momentum (AggMo), a variant of momentum which combines multiple velocity vectors with different $\\beta$ parameters. AggMo is trivial to implement, but significantly dampens oscillations, enabling it to remain stable even for aggressive $\\beta$ values such as 0.999. We reinterpret Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent as a special case of AggMo and analyze rates of convergence for quadratic objectives. Empirically, we find that AggMo is a suitable drop-in replacement for other momentum methods, and frequently delivers faster convergence.\n46th cited abstract: While it is nearly effortless for humans to quickly assess the perceptual similarity between two images, the underlying processes are thought to be quite complex. Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual losses\"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.\n47th cited abstract: Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed in Gregor and Le Cun (2010), which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately. \nIn this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.\n48th cited abstract: Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders a content image in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer. However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color & spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.\n49th cited abstract: We investigate the long time behavior of solutions to the differential equation $\\ddot{x}(t)+\\frac{c}{\\left( t+1\\right) ^{\\alpha}}\\dot{x}(t)+\\nabla \\Phi\\left( x(t)\\right) =g(t),~t\\geq0, $ where $c$ is nonnegative constant, $\\alpha\\in\\lbrack0,1[,$ $\\Phi$ is a $C^{1}$ convex function on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ and $g\\in L^{1} (0,+\\infty;\\mathcal{H}).$ We obtain sufficient conditions on the source term $g(t)$ ensuring the weak or the strong convergence of any trajectory $x(t)$ as $t\\rightarrow+\\infty$ to a minimizer of the function $\\Phi$ if one exists.\n50th cited abstract: Plain gradient descent (2:1) Stepsize and step direction as core issues (2:2) Stepsize adaptation (2:4) Backtracking (2:5) Line search (2:5) Wolfe conditions (2:7) Gradient descent convergence (2:8) Steepest descent direction (2:11) Covariant gradient descent (2:13) Newton direction (2:14) Newton method (2:15) Gauss-Newton method (2:20) Quasi-Newton methods (2:23) Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) (2:25) Conjugate gradient (2:28) Rprop (2:35)\n51th cited abstract: We propose a new method for unconstrained optimization of a smooth and strongly convex function, which attains the optimal rate of convergence of Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient descent. The new algorithm has a simple geometric interpretation, loosely inspired by the ellipsoid method. We provide some numerical evidence that the new method can be superior to Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient descent.\n52th cited abstract: We derive a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is the limit of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. This ODE exhibits approximate equivalence to Nesterov's scheme and thus can serve as a tool for analysis. We show that the continuous time ODE allows for a better understanding of Nesterov's scheme. As a byproduct, we obtain a family of schemes with similar convergence rates. The ODE interpretation also suggests restarting Nesterov's scheme leading to an algorithm, which can be rigorously proven to converge at a linear rate whenever the objective is strongly convex.\n53th cited abstract: \n54th cited abstract: This manuscript develops a new framework to analyze and design iterative optimization algorithms built on the notion of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC) from robust control theory. IQCs provide sufficient conditions for the stability of complicated interconnected systems, and these conditions can be checked by semidefinite programming. We discuss how to adapt IQC theory to study optimization algorithms, proving new inequalities about convex functions and providing a version of IQC theory adapted for use by optimization researchers. Using these inequalities, we derive numerical upper bounds on convergence rates for the gradient method, the heavy-ball method, Nesterov's accelerated method, and related variants by solving small, simple semidefinite programming problems. We also briefly show how these techniques can be used to search for optimization algorithms with desired performance characteristics, establishing a new methodology for algorithm design.\n55th cited abstract: First-order methods play a central role in large-scale machine learning. Even though many variations exist, each suited to a particular problem, almost all such methods fundamentally rely on two types of algorithmic steps: gradient descent, which yields primal progress, and mirror descent, which yields dual progress. \nWe observe that the performances of gradient and mirror descent are complementary, so that faster algorithms can be designed by LINEARLY COUPLING the two. We show how to reconstruct Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods using linear coupling, which gives a cleaner interpretation than Nesterov's original proofs. We also discuss the power of linear coupling by extending it to many other settings that Nesterov's methods cannot apply to.\n56th cited abstract: \n57th cited abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) utilizes the sparsity of magnetic resonance (MR) images to enable accurate reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. Recent CS methods have employed analytical sparsifying transforms such as wavelets, curvelets, and finite differences. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the sparsifying transform (dictionary), and reconstructing the image simultaneously from highly undersampled k-space data. The sparsity in this framework is enforced on overlapping image patches emphasizing local structure. Moreover, the dictionary is adapted to the particular image instance thereby favoring better sparsities and consequently much higher undersampling rates. The proposed alternating reconstruction algorithm learns the sparsifying dictionary, and uses it to remove aliasing and noise in one step, and subsequently restores and fills-in the k-space data in the other step. Numerical experiments are conducted on MR images and on real MR data of several anatomies with a variety of sampling schemes. The results demonstrate dramatic improvements on the order of 4-18 dB in reconstruction error and doubling of the acceptable undersampling factor using the proposed adaptive dictionary as compared to previous CS methods. These improvements persist over a wide range of practical data signal-to-noise ratios, without any parameter tuning.\n58th cited abstract: \n59th cited abstract: \n60th cited abstract: Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu//spl sim/lcv/ssim/.\n61th cited abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior at infinity of solutions of a second order evolution equation with linear damping and convex potential. The differential system is defined in a real Hilbert space. It is proved that if the potential is bounded from below, then the solution trajectories are minimizing for it and converge weakly towards a minimizer of $\\Phi$ if one exists; this convergence is strong when $\\Phi$ is even or when the optimal set has a nonempty interior. We introduce a second order proximal-like iterative algorithm for the minimization of a convex function. It is defined by an implicit discretization of the continuous evolution problem and is valid for any closed proper convex function. We find conditions on some parameters of the algorithm in order to have a convergence result similar to the continuous case.\n62th cited abstract: Let H be a real Hilbert space and \u03a6:H \u21a6 R a continuously differentiable function, whose gradient is Lipschitz continuous on bounded sets. We study the nonlinear dissipative dynamical system: ${\\ddot x}(t)+\\lambda{\\dot x}(t)+\\nabla\\Phi(x(t))=0, \\lambda>0, plus Cauchy data, mainly in view of the unconstrained minimization of the function \u03a6. New results concerning the convergence of a solution to a critical point are given in various situations, including when \u03a6 is convex (possibly with multiple minima) or is a Morse function (the critical point being then generically a local minimum); a counterexample shows that, without peculiar assumptions, a trajectory may not converge. By following the trajectories, we obtain a method for exploring local minima of \u03a6. A singular perturbation analysis links our results with those concerning gradient systems.\n63th cited abstract: \n64th cited abstract: We propose the Nesterov neural ordinary differential equations (NesterovNODEs), whose layers solve the second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) limit of Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient (NAG) method, and a generalization called GNesterovNODEs. Taking the advantage of the convergence rate O (1 /k 2 ) of the NAG scheme, GNesterovNODEs speed up training and inference by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) needed to solve the ODEs. We also prove that the adjoint state of a GNesterovNODEs also satisfies a GNesterovNODEs, thus accelerating both forward and backward ODE solvers and allowing the model to be scaled up for large-scale tasks. We empirically corroborate the advantage of GNesterovNODEs on a wide range of practical applications, including point cloud separation, image classification, and sequence modeling. Compared to NODEs, GNesterovNODEs require a significantly smaller number of NFEs while achieving better accuracy across our experiments.\n65th cited abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been attracting attention recently as a new challenger to popular deep neural generative models including GAN, VAE, etc. However, DDPMs have a disadvantage that they often require a huge number of re\ufb01nement steps during the synthesis. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new DDPM sampler based on a second-order numerical scheme for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), while the conventional sampler is based on a \ufb01rst-order numerical scheme. In general, it is not easy to compute the derivatives that are required in higher-order numerical schemes. However, in the case of DDPM, this dif\ufb01culty is alleviated by the trick which the authors call \u201c ideal derivative substitution \u201d. The newly derived higher-order sampler was applied to both image and speech generation tasks, and it is experimentally observed that the proposed sampler could synthesize plausible images and audio signals in relatively smaller number of re\ufb01nement steps.\n66th cited abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) is a challenging task due to the need for an individual\u2019s potential outcomes to be learned from biased data and without having access to the counterfactuals. We propose a novel method for inferring ITE based on the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) framework. Our method, termed Generative Adversarial Nets for inference of Individualized Treatment Effects (GANITE), is motivated by the possibility that we can capture the uncertainty in the counterfactual distributions by attempting to learn them using a GAN. We generate proxies of the counterfactual outcomes using a counterfactual generator, G, and then pass these proxies to an ITE generator, I, in order to train it. By modeling both of these using the GAN framework, we are able to infer based on the factual data, while still accounting for the unseen counterfactuals. We test our method on three real-world datasets (with both binary and multiple treatments) and show that GANITE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n67th cited abstract: \n68th cited abstract: \n69th cited abstract: \n70th cited abstract: \n71th cited abstract: \n\n\nPlease evaluate the submission based on the following criteria:\n\nClarity: Is the writing clear, structured, and terms defined?\nBaselines: Are baseline comparisons relevant, sufficient, and not excessive?\nNovelty: Is the approach innovative or distinct from prior work?\nResults: Are improvements significant, well-supported, and statistically robust?\nLimitations: Are weaknesses acknowledged and future work discussed?\nRelated Work: Are key references cited and connections made?\nTechnical: Are methods detailed enough for replication?\n\nPlease combine both the ideas and the experiments in the submission when evaluating it.\nWhen commenting on the experiments, refer to the exact numbers from the experiments.\n\nWrite the weakness in 200 words.\n\nPlease begin writing the weakness of the submission.
