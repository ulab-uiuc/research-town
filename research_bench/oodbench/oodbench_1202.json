            "abstract": "We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.",
            "introduction": " Introduction The promise of deep learning is to discover rich, hierarchical models [2] that represent probability distributions over the kinds of data encountered in artiﬁcial intelligence applications, such as natural images, audio waveforms containing speech, and symbols in natural language corpora. So far, the most striking successes in deep learning have involved discriminative models, usually those that map a high-dimensional, rich sensory input to a class label [14, 22]. These striking successes have primarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units [19, 9, 10] which have a particularly well-behaved gradient . Deep generative models have had less of an impact, due to the difﬁculty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that arise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and due to difﬁculty of leveraging the beneﬁts of piecewise linear units in the generative context. We propose a new generative model estimation procedure that sidesteps these difﬁculties.1 In the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary: a discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the data distribution. The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives both teams to improve their methods for coordinating GandDor determining better distributions to sample zfrom during training. This paper has demonstrated the viability of the adversarial modeling framework, suggesting that these research directions could prove useful. Related work An alternative to directed graphical models with latent variables are undirected graphical models with latent variables, such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) [27, 16], deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) [26] and their numerous variants. The interactions within such models are represented as the product of unnormalized potential functions, normalized by a global summa- tion/integration over all states of the random variables. This quantity (the partition function ) and its gradient are intractable for all but the most trivial instances, although they can be estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) results of this section are done in a non- parametric setting, e.g. we represent a model with inﬁnite capacity by studying convergence in the space of probability density functions. We will show in section 4.1 that this minimax game has a global optimum for pg=pdata. We will then show in section 4.2 that Algorithm 1 optimizes Eq 1, thus obtaining the desired result. 3Algorithm 1 Minibatch stochastic gradient descent training of generative adversarial nets. The number of steps to apply to the discriminator, k, is a hyperparameter. We used k= 1, the least expensive option, in our Results are reported in Table 1. This method of estimating the likelihood has somewhat high variance and does not perform well in high dimensional spaces but it is the best method available to our knowledge. Advances in generative models that can sample but not estimate likelihood directly motivate further research into how to evaluate such models. In Figures 2 and 3 we show samples drawn from the generator net after training. While we make no claim that these samples are better than samples generated by existing experiments. 4.1 Global Optimality of pg=pdata We ﬁrst consider the optimal discriminator",

We propose a fast non-iterative approximate inference method that uses a feedforward network to implement efficient exact sampling from the variational posterior. The model and this inference network are trained jointly by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Although the naive estimator of the inference network gradient is too high-variance to be useful, we make it practical by applying several straightforward model-independent variance reduction techniques. Applying our approach to training sigmoid belief networks and deep autoregressive networks, we show that it outperforms the wake-sleep algorithm on MNIST and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Reuters RCV1 document dataset."

While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. \nFirst, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. \nSecond, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input."

Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining."

This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying data-generating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty)."

We study the following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better disentangling, can be exploited to produce Markov chains that mix faster between modes. Consequently, mixing between modes would be more efficient at higher levels of representation. To better understand this, we propose a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing between modes and interpolating between samples."

The corresponding singular values specify how much local variation is plausible in directions associated with the corresponding singular vectors, while remaining in a high-density region of the input space. This paper proposes a procedure for generating samples that are consistent with the local structure captured by a contractive auto-encoder. The associated stochastic process defines a distribution from which one can sample, and which experimentally appears to converge quickly and mix well between modes, compared to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks. The intuitions behind this procedure can also be used to train the second layer of contraction that pools lower-level features and learns to be invariant to the local directions of variation discovered in the first layer.

In that spirit, we extend FPCD using an idea borrowed from Herding in order to obtain a pure sampling algorithm, which we call the rates-FPCD sampler.

In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field."

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (≫ 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

Currently the use of generative models is limited due to the difficulty in effectively learning them.

This framework provides many interesting aspects to the literature. From the generative model side: (1) A reference distribution is used to assist the learning process, which removes the need for a sampling processes in the early stages. (2) The classification power of discriminative approaches, e.g. boosting, is directly utilized. (3) The ability to select/explore features from a large candidate pool allows us to make nearly no assumptions about the training data. From the discriminative model side: (1) This framework improves the modeling capability of discriminative models. (2) It can start with source training data only and gradually \"invent\" negative samples. (3) We show how sampling schemes can be introduced to discriminative models. (4) The learning procedure helps to tighten the decision boundaries for classification, and therefore, improves robustness. In this paper, we show a variety of applications including texture modeling and classification, non-photorealistic rendering, learning image statistics/denoising, and face modeling.

After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms.

Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data."

The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each representational unit there is an adaptive predictor, which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to filter \"abstract concepts\" out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those on which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle that aim at finding binary factorial codes (Barlow et al. 1989), i.e., codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, and (3) novelty detection. Methods for finding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for finding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also nonlinear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible. The final part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential for learning unique representations of extended input sequences."

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."

Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes.

Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks.

We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model.

We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories.

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights.

To learn a DNN with small number of hidden nodes, we minimize the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the small-size DNN and a standard large-size DNN by utilizing a large number of un-transcribed data.

We often do not know whether the search for a simpler model will be worthwhile, and thus we do not go to the trouble of searching for one. In this work, we ask an important practical question: can accurate-yet-simple models be proven to exist, or shown likely to exist, before explicitly searching for them? We hypothesize that there is an important reason that simple-yet-accurate models often do exist. This hypothesis is that the size of the Rashomon set is often large, where the Rashomon set is the set of almost-equally-accurate models from a function class. If the Rashomon set is large, it contains numerous accurate models, and perhaps at least one of them is the simple model we desire. In this work, we formally present the Rashomon ratio as a new gauge of simplicity for a learning problem, depending on a function class and a data set. The Rashomon ratio is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space, and it is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory. Insight from studying the Rashomon ratio provides an easy way to check whether a simpler model might exist for a problem before finding it, namely whether several different machine learning methods achieve similar performance on the data. In that sense, the Rashomon ratio is a powerful tool for understanding why and when an accurate-yet-simple model might exist. If, as we hypothesize in this work, many real-world data sets admit large Rashomon sets, the implications are vast: it means that simple or interpretable models may often be used for high-stakes decisions without losing accuracy.",
            "introduction": " Introduction Following the principle of Occam’s Razor, one should use the simplest model that explains the data well. However, ﬁnding the simplest model, let alone any simple-yet-accurate model, is hard. As soon as simplicity constraints such as sparsity are introduced, the optimization problem for ﬁnding a simpler model typically becomes NP-hard. Thus, practitioners – who have no assurance of ﬁnding a simpler model that achieves the performance level of a black box – may not see a reason to attempt such potentially diﬃcult optimization problems. Thus, sadly, what was once the holy grail of ﬁnding simpler models, has been, for the most part, abandoned in modern machine learning. In this work, we ask a question that is essential, and potentially game-changing, for this discussion: what if we knew, before attempting a computationally expensive search for a simpler-yet-accurate model, that one was likely to exist? Perhaps knowing this would allow us to justify the time and expense of searching for such a model. If it is true that many data sets have large enough Rashomon sets to admit simple models, then there are important implications for society – it means we may be able to use simpler or interpretable models for many high-stakes problems without losing accuracy. Proving the existence of simpler models before aiming to ﬁnd them diﬀers from the current approach to machine learning in practice. We generally do not think about going from more complicated spaces to simpler ones; in fact, the reverse is true, where typical statistical learning theory and algorithms allowed us to maintain generalization when handling more complicated model classes (e.g., large margins for support 1arXiv:1908.01755v4  [cs.LG]  12 May 2022vector machines with complex kernels or large margins for boosted trees) Cortes and Vapnik (1995); Schapire et al. (1998). We even build neural networks that are so complex that they can achieve zero training error, and try afterwards to determine why they generalize Belkin et al. (2019); Nakkiran et al. (2021). However, because simple models are essential for many high-stakes decisions (Rudin, 2019), perhaps we should return to the goal of aiming directly for simpler models. We will need new ideas in order to do this. Decades of study about generalization in machine learning have provided many diﬀerent mathematical theories. Many of them measure the complexity of classes of functions without considering the data (e.g., VC theory, Vapnik, 1995), or measure properties of speciﬁc algorithms (e.g., algorithmic stability, see Bousquet and Elisseeﬀ, 2002). However, none of these theories seems to capture directly a phenomenon that occurs throughout practical machine learning. In particular, there are a vast number of data sets for which many standard machine learning algorithms perform similarly . In these cases, the machine learning models tend to generalize well . Furthermore, in these same cases, there is often a simpler model that performs similarly and also generalizes well . We hypothesize that these three observations can all be explained by the same phenomenon: the “Rashomon eﬀect,” which is the existence of many almost-equally-accurate models (Breiman et al., 2001). Firstly, following a key argument in our work, if there is a large Rashomon set of almost-equally-accurate models, a simple model may also be contained in it. Secondly, if the Rashomon set is large, many diﬀerent machine learning algorithms",

An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results show the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain."

We unify the above phenomena by defining a new complexity measure we call the effective model complexity and conjecture a generalized double descent with respect to this measure.

We compute this approximation by estimating the norm of the component of a test point's gradient that aligns with the low-curvature directions of the Hessian, and provide a tractable method for estimating this quantity.

In machine learning, Leo Breiman used this term to characterize problems where many accurate-but-different models exist to describe the same data. In this work, we study how the Rashomon effect can be useful for understanding the relationship between training and test performance, and the possibility that simple-yet-accurate models exist for many problems. We consider the Rashomon set - the set of almost-equally-accurate models for a given problem - and study its properties and the types of models it could contain. We present the Rashomon ratio as a new measure related to simplicity of model classes, which is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space; the Rashomon ratio is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory. For a hierarchy of hypothesis spaces, the Rashomon ratio can help modelers to navigate the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. In particular, we find empirically that a plot of empirical risk vs. Rashomon ratio forms a characteristic $\\Gamma$-shaped Rashomon curve, whose elbow seems to be a reliable model selection criterion. When the Rashomon set is large, models that are accurate - but that also have various other useful properties - can often be obtained. These models might obey various constraints such as interpretability, fairness, or monotonicity."

                    "abstract": "Significance While breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms. Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias–variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias–variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This “double-descent” curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias–variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning."

There has been substantial discussion about whether these algorithms are unfair to groups of individuals. While noble, this pursuit is complex and ultimately stagnating because there is no clear definition of fairness and competing definitions are largely incompatible. We argue that the focus on the question of fairness is misplaced, as these algorithms fail to meet a more important and yet readily obtainable goal: transparency. As a result, creators of secret algorithms can provide incomplete or misleading descriptions about how their models work, and various other kinds of errors can easily go unnoticed. By partially reverse engineering the COMPAS algorithm -- a recidivism-risk scoring algorithm used throughout the criminal justice system -- we show that it does not seem to depend linearly on the defendant's age, despite statements to the contrary by the algorithm's creator. Furthermore, by subtracting from COMPAS its (hypothesized) nonlinear age component, we show that COMPAS does not necessarily depend on race, contradicting ProPublica's analysis, which assumed linearity in age. In other words, faulty assumptions about a proprietary algorithm lead to faulty conclusions that go unchecked without careful reverse engineering. Were the algorithm transparent in the first place, this would likely not have occurred. The most important result in this work is that we find that there are many defendants with low risk score but long criminal histories, suggesting that data inconsistencies occur frequently in criminal justice databases. We argue that transparency satisfies a different notion of procedural fairness by providing both the defendants and the public with the opportunity to scrutinize the methodology and calculations behind risk scores for recidivism."

Any one theory of inference is neither right nor wrong but merely an axiom that may or may not be useful. Each of the many diverse theories of inference can be valuable for certain applications. However, no existing theory of inference addresses the tendency to choose, from the range of plausible data analysis specifications consistent with prior evidence, those that inadvertently favor one’s own hypotheses. Because the biases from these choices are a growing concern across scientific fields, and in a sense the reason the scientific community was invented in the first place, we introduce a new theory of inference designed to address this critical problem. We introduce hacking intervals, which are the range of a summary statistic one may obtain given a class of possible endogenous manipulations of the data. Hacking intervals require no appeal to hypothetical data sets drawn from imaginary superpopulations. A scientific result with a small hacking interval is more robust to researcher manipulation than one with a larger interval and is often easier to interpret than a classical confidence interval. Some versions of hacking intervals turn out to be equivalent to classical confidence intervals, which means they may also provide a more intuitive and potentially more useful interpretation of classical confidence intervals.

However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model f (x) = x T β with a fixed coefficient vector β) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models."

(2017), is that the flatness of minima of the loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization. Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Furthermore, if we allow to reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically without affecting its generalization properties."

We leverage upon this observation to construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. Conceptually, our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD where we use Langevin dynamics in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights. We show that the new objective has a smoother energy landscape and show improved generalization over SGD using uniform stability, under certain assumptions.

It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation.

We develop a method for estimating a priori the impact that additional experiments would have on the prediction deviation, allowing the experimenter to design a set of experiments that would most reduce uncertainty. We use prediction deviation to assess uncertainty in a model of interferon-alpha inhibition of viral infection, and to select a sequence of experiments that reduces this uncertainty. Finally, we prove a theoretical result which shows that prediction deviation provides bounds on the trajectories of the underlying true model.

Each case might have an objective other than classification accuracy, such as a desired true positive rate TPR or false positive rate FPR. Each (TPR, FPR) pair is a point on the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. We use popular machine learning methods to create models along the full ROC curve on a wide range of recidivism prediction problems. We show that many methods (support vector machines, stochastic gradient boosting and ridge regression) produce equally accurate models along the full ROC curve. However, methods that are designed for interpretability (classification and regression trees and C5.0) cannot be tuned to produce models that are accurate and/or interpretable. To handle this shortcoming, we use a recent method called supersparse linear integer models to produce accurate, transparent and interpretable scoring systems along the full ROC curve. These scoring systems can be used for decision making for many different use cases, since they are just as accurate as the most powerful black box machine learning models for many applications, but completely transparent, and highly interpretable."

Moreover, random label noise is class-conditional— the flip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisfies a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efficient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classification with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence — methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88% accuracy even when 40% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets."

The method allows us to explore the range of operational costs associated with the set of reasonable statistical models, so as to provide a useful way for practitioners to understand uncertainty. To do this, the operational cost is cast as a regularization term in a learning algorithm's objective function, allowing either an optimistic or pessimistic view of possible costs, depending on the regularization parameter. From another perspective, if we have prior knowledge about the operational cost, for instance that it should be low, this knowledge can help to restrict the hypothesis space, and can help with generalization. We provide a theoretical generalization bound for this scenario. We also show that learning with operational costs is related to robust optimization."

We assume that there is an unobservable training set that is noise free. The actual training set given to the learning algorithm is obtained from this ideal data set by corrupting the class label of each example. The probability that the class label of an example is corrupted is a function of the feature vector of the example. This would account for most kinds of noisy data one encounters in practice. We say that a learning method is noise tolerant if the classifiers learnt with noise-free data and with noisy data, both have the same classification accuracy on the noise-free data. In this paper, we analyze the noise-tolerance properties of risk minimization (under different loss functions). We show that risk minimization under 0-1 loss function has impressive noise-tolerance properties and that under squared error loss is tolerant only to uniform noise; risk minimization under other loss functions is not noise tolerant. We conclude this paper with some discussion on the implications of these theoretical results."

This derivation provides simplified proofs of a number of corollaries including: risk bounds for linear prediction (including settings where the weight vectors are constrained by either L2 or L1 constraints), margin bounds (including both L2 and L1 margins, along with more general notions based on relative entropy), a proof of the PAC-Bayes theorem, and upper bounds on L2 covering numbers (with Lp norm constraints and relative entropy constraints). In addition to providing a unified analysis, the results herein provide some of the sharpest risk and margin bounds.

We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data."

The penalties are novel since those considered in the literature are typically based on the entire model class. Oracle inequalities using these penalties are established, and the advantage of the new penalties over those based on the complexity of the whole model class is demonstrated. 1. Introduction. In this article, we propose a new complexity-penalized model selection method based on data-dependent penalties. We consider the binary classification problem where, given a random observation X ∈ R d , one has to predict Y ∈ {0,1}. A classifier or classification rule is a function f : R d → {0,1}, with loss"

We give estimates for this covering number by means of the regularity of the Mercer kernel K. For convolution type kernels K(x, t) = k(x - t) on [0, 1]n, we provide estimates depending on the decay of k, the Fourier transform of k. In particular, when k decays exponentially, our estimate for this covering number is better than all the previous results and covers many important Mercer kernels. A counter example is presented to show that the eigenfunctions of the Hilbert-Schmidt operator LK associated with a Mercer kernel K may not be uniformly bounded. Hence some previous methods used for estimating the covering number in Learning Theory are not valid. We also provide an example of a Mercer kernel to show that LK½ may not be generated by a Mercer kernel."

They are based on the methods of the theory of Gaussian and empirical processes (comparison inequalities, symmetrization method, concentration inequalities) and they improve previous results of Bartlett (1998) on bounding the generalization error of neural networks in terms of 1 -norms of the weights of neurons and of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee (1998) on bounding the generalization error of boosting.

This commit- ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob- lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theoryand practice, has developed rapidlyin fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move awayfrom exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools."

Nonlinear approximation means that the approximants do not come from linear spaces but rather from nonlinear manifolds. The central question to be studied is what, if any, are the advantages of nonlinear approximation over the simpler, more established, linear methods. This question is answered by studying the rate of approximation which is the decrease in error versus the number of parameters in the approximant. The number of parameters usually correlates well with computational effort. It is shown that in many settings the rate of nonlinear approximation can be characterized by certain smoothness conditions which are significantly weaker than required in the linear theory. Emphasis in the survey will be placed on approximation by piecewise polynomials and wavelets as well as their numerical implementation. Results on highly nonlinear methods such as optimal basis selection and greedy algorithms (adaptive pursuit) are also given. Applications to image processing, statistical estimation, regularity for PDEs, and adaptive algorithms are discussed."

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance"

The name sanity check refers to the fact that although we often expect the leave-one-out estimate to perform considerably better than the training error estimate, we are here only seeking assurance that its performance will not be considerably worse. Perhaps surprisingly, such assurance has been given only for limited cases in the prior literature on cross-validation. Any nontrivial bound on the error of leave-one-out must rely on some notion of algorithmic stability. Previous bounds relied on the rather strong notion of hypothesis stability, whose application was primarily limited to nearest-neighbor and other local algorithms. Here we introduce the new and weaker notion of error stability and apply it to obtain sanity-check bounds for leave-one-out for other classes of learning algorithms, including training error minimization procedures and Bayesian algorithms. We also provide lower bounds demonstrating the necessity of some form of error stability for proving bounds on the error of the leave-one-out estimate, and the fact that for training error minimization algorithms, in the worst case such bounds must still depend on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the hypothesis class."

If the things are found to be concentrated in a small area of the region of each class in the measurement space then the deviations will be small, and with reference to the average class properties most of the information about a thing is given by naming the class to which it belongs. In this case the information may be recorded much more briefly than if a classification had not been used. We suggest that the best classification is that which results in the briefest recording of all the attribute information. In this context, we will regard the measurements of each thing as being a message about that thing. Shannon (1948) showed that where messages may be regarded as each nominating the occurrence of a particular event among a universe of possible events, the information needed to record a series of such messages is minimised if the messages are encoded so that the length of each message is proportional to minus the logarithm of the relative frequency of occurrence of the event which it nominates. The information required is greatest when all frequencies are equal. The messages here nominate the positions in measurement space of the 5 1 points representing the attributes of the things. If the expected density of points in the measurement space is everywhere uniform, the positions of the points cannot be encoded more briefly than by a simple list of the measured values. However, if the expected density is markedly non-uniform, application"

The argument is based on a Gibbs algorithm variant and a novel way of splitting generalization error into underfitting and overfitting error. Unlike many previous approaches, ours does not require gaussian assumptions and does not depend on a good weight prior. Instead we have a prior over input output functions, thus taking into account net architecture and training set. Although our algorithm requires the computation of second-order derivatives, it has backpropagation's order of complexity. Automatically, it effectively prunes units, weights, and input lines. Various experiments with feedforward and recurrent nets are described. In an application to stock market prediction, flat minimum search outperforms conventional backprop, weight decay, and optimal brain surgeon/optimal brain damage."

                    "Inference is the process of using facts we know to learn about facts we do not know. A theory of inference gives assumptions necessary to get from the former to the latter, along with a definition for and summary of the resulting uncertainty. Any one theory of inference is neither right nor wrong but merely an axiom that may or may not be useful. Each of the many diverse theories of inference can be valuable for certain applications. However, no existing theory of inference addresses the tendency to choose, from the range of plausible data analysis specifications consistent with prior evidence, those that inadvertently favor one’s own hypotheses. Because the biases from these choices are a growing concern across scientific fields, and in a sense the reason the scientific community was invented in the first place, we introduce a new theory of inference designed to address this critical problem. We introduce hacking intervals, which are the range of a summary statistic one may obtain given a class of possible endogenous manipulations of the data. Hacking intervals require no appeal to hypothetical data sets drawn from imaginary superpopulations. A scientific result with a small hacking interval is more robust to researcher manipulation than one with a larger interval and is often easier to interpret than a classical confidence interval. Some versions of hacking intervals turn out to be equivalent to classical confidence intervals, which means they may also provide a more intuitive and potentially more useful interpretation of classical confidence intervals.

                    "When we are faced with challenging image classification tasks, we often explain our reasoning by dissecting the image, and pointing out prototypical aspects of one class or another. The mounting evidence for each of the classes helps us make our final decision. In this work, we introduce a deep network architecture that reasons in a similar way: the network dissects the image by finding prototypical parts, and combines evidence from the prototypes to make a final classification. The model thus reasons in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way ornithologists, physicians, geologists, architects, and others would explain to people on how to solve challenging image classification tasks. The network uses only image-level labels for training, meaning that there are no labels for parts of images. We demonstrate our method on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and the CBIS-DDSM dataset. Our experiments show that our interpretable network can achieve comparable accuracy with its analogous standard non-interpretable counterpart as well as other interpretable deep models.",

To overcome the problem that both treatment and control outcomes for the same unit are required for supervised learning, we propose surrogate loss functions that incorporate both treatment and control data. The new surrogates yield tighter bounds than the sum of losses for treatment and control groups. A specific choice of loss function, namely a type of hinge loss, yields a minimax support vector machine formulation. The resulting optimization problem requires the solution to only a single convex optimization problem, incorporating both treatment and control units, and it enables the kernel trick to be used to handle nonlinear (also non-parametric) estimation. Statistical learning bounds are also presented for the framework, and experimental results.",

                    "There are serious drawbacks to many current variable importance (VI) methods, in that they tend to not be comparable across model types, can obscure implicit assumptions about the data generating distribution, or can give seemingly incoherent results when multiple prediction models fit the data well. In this paper we propose a framework of VI measures for describing how much any model class (e.g. all linear models of dimension p), any model-fitting algorithm (e.g. Ridge regression with fixed regularization parameter), or any individual prediction model (e.g. a single linear model with fixed coefficient vector), relies on covariate(s) of interest. The building block of our approach, Model Reliance (MR), compares a prediction model's expected loss with that model's expected loss on a pair observations in which the value of the covariate of interest has been switched. Expanding on MR, we propose Model Class Reliance (MCR) as the upper and lower bounds on the degree to which any well-performing prediction model within a class may rely on a variable of interest, or set of variables of interest. Thus, MCR describes reliance on a variable while accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. We give probabilistic bounds for MR and MCR, leveraging existing results for U-statistics. We also illustrate connections between MR, conditional causal effects, and linear regression coefficients. We outline implementations of our approaches for regularized linear regression, and to regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We then apply MR & MCR to study the behavior of recidivism prediction models, using a public dataset of Broward County criminal records.",
                    "In our current society, secret algorithms make important decisions about individuals. There has been substantial discussion about whether these algorithms are unfair to groups of individuals. While noble, this pursuit is complex and ultimately stagnating because there is no clear definition of fairness and competing definitions are largely incompatible. We argue that the focus on the question of fairness is misplaced, as these algorithms fail to meet a more important and yet readily obtainable goal: transparency. As a result, creators of secret algorithms can provide incomplete or misleading descriptions about how their models work, and various other kinds of errors can easily go unnoticed. By partially reverse engineering the COMPAS algorithm -- a recidivism-risk scoring algorithm used throughout the criminal justice system -- we show that it does not seem to depend linearly on the defendant's age, despite statements to the contrary by the algorithm's creator. Furthermore, by subtracting from COMPAS its (hypothesized) nonlinear age component, we show that COMPAS does not necessarily depend on race, contradicting ProPublica's analysis, which assumed linearity in age. In other words, faulty assumptions about a proprietary algorithm lead to faulty conclusions that go unchecked without careful reverse engineering. Were the algorithm transparent in the first place, this would likely not have occurred. The most important result in this work is that we find that there are many defendants with low risk score but long criminal histories, suggesting that data inconsistencies occur frequently in criminal justice databases. We argue that transparency satisfies a different notion of procedural fairness by providing both the defendants and the public with the opportunity to scrutinize the methodology and calculations behind risk scores for recidivism.",

                    "Variable importance (VI) tools describe how much covariates contribute to a prediction model's accuracy. However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model f (x) = x T β with a fixed coefficient vector β) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.",

                    "Unquantified sources of uncertainty in observational causal analyses can break the integrity of the results. One would never want another analyst to repeat a calculation with the same data set, using a seemingly identical procedure, only to find a different conclusion. However, as we show in this work, there is a typical source of uncertainty that is essentially never considered in observational causal studies: the choice of match assignment for matched groups—that is, which unit is matched to which other unit before a hypothesis test is conducted. The choice of match assignment is anything but innocuous and can have a surprisingly large influence on the causal conclusions. Given that a vast number of causal inference studies test hypotheses on treatment effects after treatment cases are matched with similar control cases, we should find a way to quantify how much this extra source of uncertainty impacts results. What we would really like to be able to report is that no matter which match assignment is made, as long as the match is sufficiently good, then the hypothesis test results are still informative. In this paper, we provide methodology based on discrete optimization to create robust tests that explicitly account for this possibility. We formulate robust tests for binary and continuous data based on common test statistics as integer linear programs solvable with common methodologies. We study the finite-sample behavior of our test statistic in the discrete-data case. We apply our methods to simulated and real-world data sets and show that they can produce useful results in practical applied settings.",
                    "Objective: To use seizure risk factors from continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) to create a simple scoring system for predicting the probability of electrographic seizures in patients with acute illness. Background: cEEG use has expanded, motivated by the high incidence of subclinical seizures in hospitalized encephalopathic patients. EEG features reported as predictors of seizures include epileptiform discharges and periodic discharges. However, no study has examined how these predictors affect seizure risk jointly. Here we propose a simple scoring system for seizure risk that we refer to as the 2HELPS2B score. Design/Methods: We used a prospective database to derive a dataset containing 24 clinical and electrographic variables for 5427 >24hr cEEG sessions. Using this dataset, we created a scoring system model to estimate seizure risk in patients undergoing cEEG. The model was built using a new machine learning method (RiskSLIM) that is designed to produce accurate, risk-calibrated, scoring systems with a limited number of variables and small integer weights. We validated the predictive accuracy and risk-calibration of our model using cross-validation, and compared its performance to models built with state-of-the-art logistic regression methods. Results: Our final model (2HELPS2B) has an AUC of 0.821 and average calibration error of 2.7%. It includes 6 variables with the following point assignments: (i) brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges (B(I)RDs) (2 points); (ii) presence of LPD, LRDA, or BIPDs (1 point); (iii) prior seizure (1 point); (iv) sporadic epileptiform discharges (1 point); (v) frequency >2.0Hz for any periodic or rhythmic pattern (1 point); (vi) presence of “plus” features (superimposed, rhythmic, sharp, or fast activity) (1 point). The predicted seizure risk of each score is: 0: 5%, 1: 12%, 2: 27%, 3: 50%, 4: 73%, 5: 88%, 6–7: >95%. Conclusions: The 2HELPS2B score allows accurate prediction of seizures by adding points for 6 readily available variables from the patient history and initial EEG.

                    "We introduce a flexible framework that produces high-quality almost-exact matches for causal inference. Most prior work in matching uses ad-hoc distance metrics, often leading to poor quality matches, particularly when there are irrelevant covariates. In this work, we learn an interpretable distance metric for matching, which leads to substantially higher quality matches. The learned distance metric stretches the covariates according to their contribution to outcome prediction. The framework is flexible in that the user can choose the form of the distance metric and the type of optimization algorithm. Our ability to learn flexible distance metrics leads to matches that are interpretable and useful for the estimation of conditional average treatment effects.",

                    "With ever-increasing advancements in technology, neuroscientists are able to collect data in greater volumes and with finer resolution. The bottleneck in understanding how the brain works is consequently shifting away from the amount and type of data we can collect and toward what we actually do with the data. There has been a growing interest in leveraging this vast volume of data across levels of analysis, measurement techniques, and experimental paradigms to gain more insight into brain function. Such efforts are visible at an international scale, with the emergence of big data neuroscience initiatives, such as the BRAIN initiative (Bargmann et al., 2014), the Human Brain Project, the Human Connectome Project, and the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative. With these large-scale projects, much thought has been given to data-sharing across groups (Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014; Sejnowski et al., 2014); however, even with such data-sharing initiatives, funding mechanisms, and infrastructure, there still exists the challenge of how to cohesively integrate all the data. At multiple stages and levels of neuroscience investigation, machine learning holds great promise as an addition to the arsenal of analysis tools for discovering how the brain works."

If we can establish that simpler models are likely to exist for many datasets, it would encourage researchers and practitioners to invest time in finding these models, potentially leading to advancements in interpretability and trust in machine learning systems. This could also open new avenues for practical applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where understanding model decisions is essential.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of the optimization problem when introducing simplicity constraints, such as sparsity, which can make the search for simpler models NP-hard. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate relationships within the data that could lead to simpler representations. Additionally, there are theoretical obstacles in proving the existence of simpler models within the vast space of potential solutions, as well as practical difficulties in designing algorithms that can efficiently navigate this space.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has largely focused on complex models that achieve high accuracy without considering the potential for simpler alternatives. There has been a lack of theoretical frameworks that directly address the existence of simpler models in the context of the Rashomon effect. Barriers include the prevailing mindset in machine learning that prioritizes model complexity for performance, as well as insufficient exploration of the relationship between model simplicity and generalization. Our approach differs by explicitly investigating the conditions under which simpler models can exist and be effective, thereby providing a new perspective on model selection.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves analyzing datasets to identify the presence of large Rashomon sets and their implications for model simplicity. We will utilize a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation on benchmark datasets, measuring model performance using metrics such as accuracy and interpretability. The expected outcome is to demonstrate that for many datasets, simpler models not only exist but also perform comparably to more complex models, thereby providing a foundation for future research into model selection and interpretability in machine learning."

            "introduction": " Introduction One of the ﬁrst things a scientist in a data-intensive ﬁeld hears about statistics is that there are two different approaches: frequentism and Bayesianism. Despite their importance, many researchers never have opportunity to learn the distinctions between them and the different practical approaches that result. This paper seeks to synthesize the philosophical and prag- matic aspects of this debate, so that scientists who use these approaches might be better prepared to understand the tools available to them. Along the way we will explore the funda- mental philosophical disagreement between frequentism and Bayesianism, explore the practical aspects of how this dis- agreement affects data analysis, and discuss the ways that these practices may affect the interpretation of scientiﬁc results. introduction can be found in [Gelman2004]. Below, we will propose a straightforward model and compare a standard frequentist approach with three MCMC implementations available in Python. Application: A Simple Linear Model As an example of a more realistic data-driven analysis, let’s consider a simple three-parameter linear model which ﬁts a straight-line to data with unknown errors. The parameters will be the the y-intercept a, the slope b, and the (unknown) normal scatter sabout the line. For data D=fxi;yig, the model is ˆy(xija;b) =a+bxi; and the likelihood is the product of the Gaussian distribution for each point: L(Dja;b;s) = ( 2ps2)\u0000N=2N Õ i=1exp\u0014\u0000[yi\u0000ˆy(xija;b)]2 2s2\u0015 : We will evaluate this model on the following data set: import numpy as np np.random.seed(42) # for repeatability theta_true = (25, 0.5) xdata = 100 *np.random.random(20) ydata = theta_true[0] + theta_true[1] *xdata ydata = np.random.normal(ydata, 10) # add error Below we will consider a frequentist solution to this problem computed with the statsmodels package6, as well as a Bayesian solution computed with several MCMC implementations in Python: emcee7, PyMC8, and PyStan9. A full experiments, but this is not fundamental. The probability is a statement of the researcher’s knowledge of what the true ﬂux is. For Bayesians, probabilities are fundamentally related to their own knowledge about an event . This means, for example, that in a Bayesian view, we can meaningfully talk about the probability that the true ﬂux of a star lies in a given range. That probability codiﬁes our knowledge of the value based on prior information and available data. The surprising thing is that this arguably subtle difference in philosophy can lead, in practice, to vastly different approaches to the statistical analysis of data. Below we will explore a few examples chosen to illustrate the differences in approach, along with associated Python code to demonstrate the practical aspects of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches. A Simple Example: Photon Flux Measurements First we will compare the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to the solution of an extremely simple problem. Imagine thatarXiv:1411.5018v1  [astro-ph.IM]  18 Nov 20142 PROC. OF THE 13th PYTHON IN SCIENCE CONF. (SCIPY 2014) we point a telescope to the sky, and observe the light coming from a single star. For simplicity, we will assume that the star’s true photon ﬂux is constant with time, i.e. that is it has a ﬁxed value F; we will also ignore effects like sky background systematic errors. We will assume that a series ofNmeasurements are performed, where the ithmeasurement reports the observed ﬂux Fiand error ei.2The question is, given this set of measurements D=fFi;eig, what is our best estimate of the true ﬂux F? First we will use Python to generate some toy data to demonstrate the two approaches to the problem. We will draw 50 samples Fiwith a",

These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\\epsilon} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs.

For a statistician, an inverse problem is an inference or estimation problem. The data are finite in number and contain errors, as they do in classical estimation or inference problems, and the unknown typically is infinite dimensional, as it is in nonparametric regression. The additional complication in an inverse problem is that the data are only indirectly related to the unknown. Canonical abstract formulations of statistical estimation problems subsume this complication by allowing probability distributions to be indexed in more-or-less arbitrary ways by parameters, which can be infinite dimensional. Standard statistical concepts, questions and considerations such as bias, variance, mean-squared error, identifiability, consistency, efficiency and various forms of optimality apply to inverse problems. This paper discusses inverse problems as statistical estimation and inference problems, and points to the literature for a variety of techniques and results. It shows how statistical measures of performance apply to techniques used in practical inverse problems, such as regularization, maximum penalized likelihood, Bayes estimation and the Backus–Gilbert method. The paper generalizes results of Backus and Gilbert characterizing parameters in inverse problems that can be estimated with finite bias. It also establishes general conditions under which parameters in inverse problems can be estimated consistently."

By addressing this problem, the research community can enhance the rigor and transparency of data analysis, leading to more reliable scientific conclusions. This synthesis of philosophical and pragmatic aspects can guide future research methodologies, improve statistical literacy among scientists, and foster better communication of results across disciplines.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge lies in the deep-rooted philosophical differences between the two approaches, which can lead to fundamentally different interpretations of the same data. Naive approaches may fail because they overlook these philosophical distinctions, leading to inappropriate application of statistical methods. Additionally, the technical complexities of implementing Bayesian methods, such as MCMC, require a solid understanding of both the underlying mathematics and computational techniques, which can be a barrier for many researchers.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research often focused on either frequentist or Bayesian methods in isolation, neglecting a comprehensive comparison that includes both philosophical and practical dimensions. Barriers include a lack of interdisciplinary communication and the dominance of frequentist methods in many scientific fields. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a clear comparison and practical examples that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, thus improving upon prior work that has not synthesized these perspectives.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nThe proposed methodology involves a comparative analysis of a simple three-parameter linear model using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning.

Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed.

Specifically, the proposed autoencoder transforms an input face image such that the transformed image can be successfully used for face recognition but not for gender classification. In order to train this autoencoder, we propose a novel training scheme, referred to as semi-adversarial training in this work. The training is facilitated by attaching a semi-adversarial module consisting of an auxiliary gender classifier and an auxiliary face matcher to the autoencoder. The objective function utilized for training this network has three terms: one to ensure that the perturbed image is a realistic face image; another to ensure that the gender attributes of the face are confounded; and a third to ensure that biometric recognition performance due to the perturbed image is not impacted. Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed architecture in extending gender privacy to face images.",

                    "Understanding the physical attributes of protein‐ligand interfaces, the source of most biological activity, is a fundamental problem in biophysics. Knowing the characteristic features of interfaces also enables the design of molecules with potent and selective interactions. Prediction of native protein‐ligand interactions has traditionally focused on the development of physics‐based potential energy functions, empirical scoring functions that are fit to binding data, and knowledge‐based potentials that assess the likelihood of pairwise interactions. Here we explore a new approach, testing the hypothesis that protein‐ligand binding results in computationally detectable rigidification of the protein‐ligand interface. Our SiteInterlock approach uses rigidity theory to efficiently measure the relative interfacial rigidity of a series of small‐molecule ligand orientations and conformations for a number of protein complexes. In the majority of cases, SiteInterlock detects a near‐native binding mode as being the most rigid, with particularly robust performance relative to other methods when the ligand‐free conformation of the protein is provided. The interfacial rigidification of both the protein and ligand prove to be important characteristics of the native binding mode. This measure of rigidity is also sensitive to the spatial coupling of interactions and bond‐rotational degrees of freedom in the interface. While the predictive performance of SiteInterlock is competitive with the best of the five other scoring functions tested, its measure of rigidity encompasses cooperative rather than just additive binding interactions, providing novel information for detecting native‐like complexes. SiteInterlock shows special strength in enhancing the prediction of native complexes by ruling out inaccurate poses. Proteins 2016; 84:1888–1901. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

            "abstract": "Several variants of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ($\\approx 15$ years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.",
            "introduction": " introduction of full BPTT training, Gers et al. [27] utilized a training method based on Extended Kalman Filtering which enabled the LSTM to be trained on some pathological cases at the cost of high computational complexity. Schmidhuber et al. [28] proposed using a hybrid evolution-based method instead of BPTT for training but retained the vanilla LSTM architecture. Bayer et al. [29] evolved different LSTM block architectures that maximize ﬁtness on context-sensitive grammars. A largerstudy of this kind was later done by Jozefowicz et al. [30]. Sak et al. [9]introduced a linear projection layer that projects the output of the LSTM layer down before recurrent and forward connections in order to reduce the amount of parameters for LSTM networks with many blocks. By introducing a trainable scaling parameter for the slope of the gate activation functions, Doetsch et al. [5]were able to improve the performance of LSTM on an ofﬂine handwriting recognition dataset. In what they call Dynamic Cortex Memory , Otte et al. [31] improved convergence speed of LSTM by adding recurrent connections between the gates of a single block (but not between the blocks). Cho et al. [32] proposed a simpliﬁed variant of the LSTM architecture called Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). They used neither peephole connections nor output activation functions, and coupled the input and the forget gate into an update gate . Finally, their output gate (called reset gate ) only gates the recurrent connections to the block input ( Wz). Chung et al. [33] performed an initial comparison between GRU and Vanilla LSTM and reported mixed conclusions we restrict our further analysis to the top 10% performing trials for each combination of dataset and variant (see bottom half of Figure 3). This way our ﬁndings will be less dependent on the chosen search space and will be representative for the case of “reasonable hyperparameter tuning efforts.”9 The ﬁrst important observation based on Figure 3 is that removing the output activation function (NOAF) or the forget gate (NFG) signiﬁcantly hurt performance on all three datasets. Apart from the CEC, the ability to forget old information and the squashing of the cell state appear to be critical for the LSTM architecture. Indeed, without the output activation function, the block output can in principle grow unbounded. Coupling the input and the forget gate avoids this problem and might render the use of an output non-linearity less important, which could explain why GRU performs well without it. 9How much effort is “reasonable” will still depend on the search space. If the ranges are chosen much larger, the search will take much longer to ﬁnd good hyperparameters.Input and forget gate coupling (CIFG) did not signiﬁcantly change mean performance on any of the datasets, although the best performance improved slightly on music modeling. Similarly, removing peephole connections (NP) also did not lead to signiﬁcant changes, but the best performance improved slightly for handwriting recognition. Both of these variants simplify LSTMs and reduce the computational complexity, so it might be worthwhile to incorporate these changes into the architecture. Adding full gate recurrence (FGR) did not signiﬁcantly change performance on TIMIT or IAM Online, but led to worse background presents the average number of parameters for the top 10% performers of every variant. speciﬁc to our choice of search ranges. We have tried to chose reasonable ranges for the hyperparameters that include the best settings for each variant and are still small enough to allow for",

We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions, including many different parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time.",

The common trait among these functions is that they implement local competition between small groups of computational units within a layer, so that only part of the network is activated for any given input pattern. In this paper, we attempt to visualize and understand this self-modularization, and suggest a unified explanation for the beneficial properties of such networks. We also show how our insights can be directly useful for efficiently performing retrieval over large datasets using neural networks.",

                    "Design optimization in the absence of complete information about uncertain quantities has been recently gaining consideration, as expensive repetitive computation tasks are becoming tractable due to the invention of faster and parallel computers. This work uses Bayesian inference to quantify design reliability when only sample measurements of the uncertain quantities are available. A generalized Bayesian reliability based design optimization algorithm has been proposed and implemented for numerical as well as engineering design problems. The approach uses an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to obtain a trade-off front between design objectives and reliability. The Bayesian approach provides a well-defined link between the amount of available information and the reliability through a confidence measure, and the EA acts as an efficient optimizer for a discrete and multi-dimensional objective space. Additionally, a GPU-based parallelization study shows computational speed-up of close to 100 times in a simulated scenario wherein the constraint qualification checks may be time consuming and could render a sequential implementation that can be impractical for large sample sets. These results show promise for the use of a parallel implementation of EAs in handling design optimization problems under uncertainties.",

To acquire problem solving prowess through playing, POWERPLAY-based artificial explorers by design continually come up with the fastest to find, initially novel, but eventually solvable problems. They also continually simplify or speed up solutions to previous problems. We report on results of first experiments with POWERPLAY. A self-delimiting recurrent neural network (SLIM RNN) is used as a general computational architecture to implement the system's solver. Its weights can encode arbitrary, self-delimiting, halting or non-halting programs affecting both environment (through effectors) and internal states encoding abstractions of event sequences. In open-ended fashion, our POWERPLAY-driven RNNs learn to become increasingly general problem solvers, continually adding new problem solving procedures to the growing repertoire, exhibiting interesting developmental stages.",

Neuroevolution (NE), used for continuous RL problems, has to either reduce the problem dimensionality by (1) compressing the representation of the neural network controllers or (2) employing a pre-processor (compressor) that transforms the high-dimensional raw inputs into low-dimensional features. In this paper, we are able to evolve extremely small recurrent neural network (RNN) controllers for a task that previously required networks with over a million weights. The high-dimensional visual input, which the controller would normally receive, is first transformed into a compact feature vector through a deep, max-pooling convolutional neural network (MPCNN).

                    "Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies between temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the simple RNN (SRN) architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of SRN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving three tasks: audio signal generation, TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both SRN and LSTM networks, and online handwriting recognition, where it outperforms SRNs.",

Evolving such large nets is made possible by representing them in the frequency domain as a set of coefficients that are transformed into weight matrices via an inverse Fourier-type transform. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to tackle TORCS using vision, and successfully evolve a neural network controllers of this size.",

However, as RL tasks become more challenging, the networks required become larger, as do their genomes. But, scaling NE to large nets (i.e. tens of thousands of weights) is infeasible using direct encodings that map genes one-to-one to network components. In this paper, we scale-up our compressed network encoding where network weight matrices are represented indirectly as a set of Fourier-type coefficients, to tasks that require very-large networks due to the high-dimensionality of their input space. The approach is demonstrated successfully on two reinforcement learning tasks in which the control networks receive visual input: (1) a vision-based version of the octopus control task requiring networks with over 3 thousand weights, and (2) a version of the TORCS driving game where networks with over 1 million weights are evolved to drive a car around a track using video images from the driver's perspective.",

CNCS maintains a probability distribution over complexity classes that it uses to select which class to optimize. Class probabilities are adapted based on their expected fitness, starting with a prior biased toward the simplest networks. Experiments on a challenging non-linear version of the helicopter hovering task, show that the method consistently finds simple solutions.",

Networks with many inputs (e.g. raw video) imply a very high dimensional search space if encoded directly. Indirect methods use a more compact genotype representation that is transformed into networks of potentially arbitrary size. In this paper, we present an indirect method where networks are encoded by a set of Fourier coefficients which are transformed into network weight matrices via an inverse Fourier-type transform. Because there often exist network solutions whose weight matrices contain regularity (i.e. adjacent weights are correlated), the number of coefficients required to represent these networks in the frequency domain is much smaller than the number of weights (in the same way that natural images can be compressed by ignore high-frequency components). This \"compressed\" encoding is compared to the direct approach where search is conducted in the weight space on the high-dimensional octopus arm task. The results show that representing networks in the frequency domain can reduce the search-space dimensionality by as much as two orders of magnitude, both accelerating convergence and yielding more general solutions.",
                    "The principle of minimum description length suggests looking for the simplest network that works well on the training examples, where simplicity is measured by network description size based on a reasonable programming language for encoding networks. Previous work used an assembler-like universal network encoding language (NEL) and Speed Priorbased search (related to Levin’s Universal Search) to quickly find low-complexity nets with excellent generalization performance. Here we define a more natural and often more practical NEL whose instructions are frequency domain coefficients. Frequency coefficients may get encoded by few bits, hence huge weight matrices may just be low-complexity superpositions of patterns computed by programs with few elementary instructions. On various benchmarks this weight matrix encoding greatly accelerates the search. The scheme was tested on pole-balancing, long-term dependency T-maze, and ball throwing. Some of the solutions turn out to be unexpectedly simple as they are computable by fairly short bit",

This scheme exploits spatial regularities in the matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the representation by ignoring high-frequency coefficients, as is done in lossy image compression. We compare the efficiency of searching in this \"compressed\" network space to searching in the space of directly encoded networks, using the CoSyNE neuroevolution algorithm on three benchmark problems: pole-balancing, ball throwing and octopus arm control. The results show that this encoding can dramatically reduce the search space dimensionality such that solutions can be found in significantly fewer evaluations",

However, it has tunable difficulty, and at the lowest difficulty setting decent score can be achieved using rudimentary strategies and a small fraction of the input space. To investigate the properties of the benchmark, we evolve neural network-based controllers using different network architectures and input spaces. We show that it is relatively easy to learn basic strategies capable of clearing individual levels of low difficulty, but that these controllers have problems with generalization to unseen levels and with taking larger parts of the input space into account. A number of directions worth exploring for learning betterperforming strategies are discussed.",

This would allow to use camera as an input for neural network controller used in real robot. The robots were simulated using software simulation environment. In the experiments the robots were trained to drive with imaximum average speed. Such fitness forces them to learn how to drive on roads and avoid collisions.

Humans learn how to use language in a society of language users, which is probably the most effective way to learn a language from the ground up. Principles that might allow an artificial agents to learn language this way are not known at present. Here we present a framework which begins to address this challenge. Our auto-catalytic, endogenous, reflective architecture (AERA) supports the creation of agents that can learn natural language by observation. We present results from two experiments where our S1 agent learns human communication by observing two humans interacting in a realtime mock television interview, using gesture and situated language. Results show that S1 can learn multimodal complex language and multimodal communicative acts, using a vocabulary of 100 words with numerous sentence formats, by observing unscripted interaction between the humans, with no grammar being provided to it a priori, and only high-level information about the format of the human interaction in the form of high-level goals of the interviewer and interviewee and a small ontology. The agent learns both the pragmatics, semantics, and syntax of complex sentences spoken by the human subjects on the topic of recycling of objects such as aluminum cans, glass bottles, plastic, and wood, as well as use of manual deictic reference and anaphora.",
                    "An important part of human intelligence, both historically and operationally, is our ability to communicate. We learn how to communicate, and maintain our communicative skills, in a society of communicators – a highly effective way to reach and maintain proficiency in this complex skill. Principles that might allow artificial agents to learn language this way are in completely known at present – the multi-dimensional nature of socio-communicative skills are beyond every machine learning framework so far proposed. Our work begins to address the challenge of proposing a way for observation-based machine learning of natural language and communication. Our framework can learn complex communicative skills with minimal up-front knowledge. The system learns by incrementally producing predictive models of causal relationships in observed data, guided by goal-inference and reasoning using forward-inverse models. We present results from two experiments where our S1 agent learns human communication by observing two humans interacting in a realtime TV-style interview, using multimodal communicative gesture and situated language to talk about recycling of various materials and objects. S1 can learn multimodal complex language and multimodal communicative acts, a vocabulary of 100 words forming natural sentences with relatively complex sentence structure, including manual deictic reference and anaphora. S1 is seeded only with high-level information about goals of the interviewer and interviewee, and a small ontology; no grammar or other information is provided to S1 a priori. The agent learns the pragmatics, semantics, and syntax of complex utterances spoken and gestures from scratch, by observing the humans compare and contrast the cost and pollution related to recycling aluminum cans, glass bottles, newspaper, plastic, and wood. After 20 hours of observation S1 can perform an unscripted TV interview with a human, in the same style, without making mistakes.",
                    "While the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science (CogSci) both originated from a deep interest in the same phenomenon – intelligence – and both setting themselves high aims in their early days, each has since greatly narrowed its focus, and all but abandoned their core subject for a more limited version of the phenomenon. The many non-obvious causes for this change over the decades are perhaps understandable, but they have significantly reduced the potential of both fields to impact our understanding of the fundamentals of intelligence – in the wild and in the laboratory. This position paper argues that researchers in the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI) should carefully posit their research objectives and methodology to avoid repeating the same mistakes. 1 The Big Picture of Intelligence and Cognition Roughly speaking, artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science (CogSci) come from the same observation and imagination, namely that in a certain sense, the human mind and the electronic computer are – or can become – similar to each other. The similarities (and differences) have been suggested by many people, including Wiener [26], Turing [16], von Neumann [9], McCulloch and Pitt [7], though each from a different perspective. Initiated in this atmosphere, AI and CogSci can be seen as two sides of the same coin: while the former attempts to build a mind-like machine [11], the latter tries to study the mind as a machine [1]. Their relation is like that between engineering and science in general, that is, there is a strong mutual dependence. It is obvious that, to build an intelligent system, one has to have a clear idea about how intelligence works, and most of our knowledge on that topic comes from the study of the human mind. On the other hand, to evaluate the correctness of a theory of cognition, a straightforward way is to model it in an artifact to see if it produces the expected results. Given this relation, it is natural for AI to get inspiration from CogSci, as well as for CogSci to use AI models. Various theories have been proposed both to explain the phenomena observed in human cognition and to guide the design of machine intelligence (cf. [8, 10]). However, as the difficulties in this research became more and more clear, the mainstream in both fields gradually departed from the original objective to",
                    "We have designed a machine that becomes increasingly better at behaving in underspecified circumstances, in a goal-directed way, on the job, by modeling itself and its environment as experience accumulates. Based on principles of autocatalysis, endogeny, and reflectivity, the work provides an architectural blueprint for constructing systems with high levels of operational autonomy in underspecified circumstances, starting from a small seed. Through value-driven dynamic priority scheduling controlling the parallel execution of a vast number of reasoning threads, the system achieves recursive self-improvement after it leaves the lab, within the boundaries imposed by its designers. A prototype system has been implemented and demonstrated to learn a complex real-world task, real-time multimodal dialogue with humans, by on-line observation. Our work presents solutions to several challenges that must be solved for achieving artificial general intelligence.",
                    "Pure scientists do not only invent new methods to solve given problems. They also invent new problems. The recent POWERPLAY framework formalizes this type of curiosity and creativity in a new, general, yet practical way. To acquire problem solving prowess through playing, POWERPLAY-based artificial explorers by design continually come up with the fastest to find, initially novel, but eventually solvable problems. They also continually simplify or speed up solutions to previous problems. We report on results of first experiments with POWERPLAY. A self-delimiting recurrent neural network (SLIM RNN) is used as a general computational architecture to implement the system's solver. Its weights can encode arbitrary, self-delimiting, halting or non-halting programs affecting both environment (through effectors) and internal states encoding abstractions of event sequences. In open-ended fashion, our POWERPLAY-driven RNNs learn to become increasingly general problem solvers, continually adding new problem solving procedures to the growing repertoire, exhibiting interesting developmental stages.",
                    "Recently, interest has been revived in self-reflective systems in the context of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI system should be intelligent enough to be able to reason about its own program code, and make modifications where it sees fit, improving on the initial code written by human programmers. A pertinent example is the GA¶del Machine, which employs a proof searcherâ€”in parallel to its regular problem solves dutiesâ€”to find a self-rewrite of which it can prove that it will be beneficial.",
                    "The execution of an artificial agent is usually implemented with a sense--reason--act cycle. This cycle includes tasks such as event processing, generating and revising plans, and selecting actions to execute. However, there are typically many choices in the design of such a cycle, which are often hard-coded in the cycle in an ad hoc way. The question of this paper is how one decides, in a principled way, how often and which reasoning rules to apply, how to interleave the execution of plans, or when to start replanning. This paper proposes and formalizes the eliciting conditions of hope, fear, joy, and distress according to a well-known psychological model of human emotion. These conditions are then used to reduce the choices an agent can make in each state. They formalize the idea that emotions focus an agent's attention on what is important in each state.",
                    "Even though emotions sometimes lead us astray, there is mounting evidence from psychology and neurology that emotions have---on the whole---a positive effect on intelligent decision making and acting. Emotions help both overtly and covertly by focusing a person's attention to what is important and pruning unpromising directions of reasoning. Like humans, artificial agents---such as robots and virtual characters---have to act intelligently under resource constraints. A deep understanding of how human emotions function as innate and learned heuristics can help us in designing more effective artificial agents. Even if one does not want artificial agents to behave emotionally, it will still be useful to make these agents have knowledge of human emotions, so that they can take these into account when interacting or cooperating with humans. In order to incorporate emotions in artificial agents, a bridge must be built from psychological models of human emotions to computer science. This is done in this dissertation by capturing an emotion theory in a formal agent specification language. This formalization both serves as a foundation for the implementation of emotions in artificial agents, and enables us to formally analyze properties of the psychological model, leading to a more precise understanding of the workings of human emotions",
                    "This paper proposes a module-based vision for designing BDI-based multi-agent programming languages. The introduced concept of modules enables common programming techniques such as encapsulation and information hiding for BDI-based programs, and facilitates the implementation of agent roles and profiles. This vision is applied to a BDI-based agent programming language to which specific programming constructs are added to allow the implementation of modules. The syntax and intuitive semantics of module based programming constructs are explained. An example is presented to illustrate how modules can be used to implement BDI-based multi-agent systems.",
                    "Although popular among computer scientists, the OCC model of emotions contains a number of ambiguities that stand in the way of a truthful formalization or implementation. This paper aims to identify and clarify several of these ambiguities. Furthermore, a new inheritance-based view of the logical structure of emotions of the OCC model is proposed and discussed.",
                    "When constructing a formal model of emotions for intelligent agents, two types of aspects have to be taken into account. First, qualitative aspects pertain to the conditions that elicit emotions. Second, quantitative aspects pertain to the actual experience and intensity of elicited emotions. In this presentation, we show how the qualitative aspects of a well-known psychological model of human emotions can be formalized in an agent specification language and how its quantitative aspects can be integrated into this model. Furthermore, we discuss several unspecified details and implicit assumptions in the psychological model that are explicated by this effort."

Recently, we have introduced reinforcement learning in this framework, which allows an agent to learn goal-directed sequences of behaviours based on a reward signal, perceived at the end of a sequence. Although stability of the dynamic neural fields and behavioural organisation allowed to demonstrate autonomous learning in the robotic system, learning of longer sequences was taking prohibitedly long time. Here, we combine the neural dynamic reinforcement learning with shaping, which consists in providing intermediate rewards and accelerates learning.We have implemented the new learning algorithm on a simulated Kuka YouBot robot and evaluated robustness and efficacy of learning in a pick-and-place task.",

A machine learning technique called Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is used to create these models based on a series of images. Our research investigates how manipulation actions might allow for the development of better visual models and therefore better robot vision. This paper describes how visual object representations can be learned and improved by performing object manipulation actions, such as, poke, push and pick-up with a humanoid robot. The improvement can be measured and allows for the robot to select and perform the `right' action, i.e. the action with the best possible improvement of the detector.",
                    "Dealing with high-dimensional input spaces, like visual input, is a challenging task for reinforcement learning (RL). Neuroevolution (NE), used for continuous RL problems, has to either reduce the problem dimensionality by (1) compressing the representation of the neural network controllers or (2) employing a pre-processor (compressor) that transforms the high-dimensional raw inputs into low-dimensional features. In this paper, we are able to evolve extremely small recurrent neural network (RNN) controllers for a task that previously required networks with over a million weights. The high-dimensional visual input, which the controller would normally receive, is first transformed into a compact feature vector through a deep, max-pooling convolutional neural network (MPCNN). Both the MPCNN preprocessor and the RNN controller are evolved successfully to control a car in the TORCS racing simulator using only visual input.

Humans learn how to use language in a society of language users, which is probably the most effective way to learn a language from the ground up. Principles that might allow an artificial agents to learn language this way are not known at present. Here we present a framework which begins to address this challenge. Our auto-catalytic, endogenous, reflective architecture (AERA) supports the creation of agents that can learn natural language by observation. We present results from two experiments where our S1 agent learns human communication by observing two humans interacting in a realtime mock television interview, using gesture and situated language. Results show that S1 can learn multimodal complex language and multimodal communicative acts, using a vocabulary of 100 words with numerous sentence formats, by observing unscripted interaction between the humans, with no grammar being provided to it a priori, and only high-level information about the format of the human interaction in the form of high-level goals of the interviewer and interviewee and a small ontology. The agent learns both the pragmatics, semantics, and syntax of complex sentences spoken by the human subjects on the topic of recycling of objects such as aluminum cans, glass bottles, plastic, and wood, as well as use of manual deictic reference and anaphora.",
                    "In recent years, deep artificial neural networks (including recurrent ones) have won numerous contests in pattern recognition and machine learning. This historical survey compactly summarises relevant work, much of it from the previous millennium. Shallow and deep learners are distinguished by the depth of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning & evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.

One of its goals is to assign credit to those who contributed to the present state of the art. I acknowledge the limitations of attempting to achieve this goal. The DL research community itself may be viewed as a continually evolving, deep network of scientists who have influenced each other in complex ways. Starting from recent DL results, I tried to trace back the origins of relevant ideas through the past half century and beyond, sometimes using “local search” to follow citations of citations backwards in time. Since not all DL publications properly acknowledge earlier relevant work, additional global search strategies were employed, aided by consulting numerous neural network experts. As a result, the present draft mostly consists of references (about 800 entries so far). Nevertheless, through an expert selection bias I may have missed important work. A related bias was surely introduced by my special familiarity with the work of my own DL research group in the past quarter-century. For these reasons, the present draft should be viewed as merely a snapshot of an ongoing credit assignment process.

                    "Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies between temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the simple RNN (SRN) architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of SRN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving three tasks: audio signal generation, TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both SRN and LSTM networks, and online handwriting recognition, where it outperforms SRNs.",

They neither change their parameters during evaluation nor use feedback from higher to lower layers. Real brains, however, do. So does our Deep Attention Selective Network (dasNet) architecture. DasNets feedback structure can dynamically alter its convolutional filter sensitivities during classification. It harnesses the power of sequential processing to improve classification performance, by allowing the network to iteratively focus its internal attention on some of its convolutional filters. Feedback is trained through direct policy search in a huge million-dimensional parameter space, through scalable natural evolution strategies (SNES). On the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, dasNet outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model.",
                    "An important part of human intelligence, both historically and operationally, is our ability to communicate. We learn how to communicate, and maintain our communicative skills, in a society of communicators – a highly effective way to reach and maintain proficiency in this complex skill. Principles that might allow artificial agents to learn language this way are in completely known at present – the multi-dimensional nature of socio-communicative skills are beyond every machine learning framework so far proposed. Our work begins to address the challenge of proposing a way for observation-based machine learning of natural language and communication. Our framework can learn complex communicative skills with minimal up-front knowledge. The system learns by incrementally producing predictive models of causal relationships in observed data, guided by goal-inference and reasoning using forward-inverse models. We present results from two experiments where our S1 agent learns human communication by observing two humans interacting in a realtime TV-style interview, using multimodal communicative gesture and situated language to talk about recycling of various materials and objects. S1 can learn multimodal complex language and multimodal communicative acts, a vocabulary of 100 words forming natural sentences with relatively complex sentence structure, including manual deictic reference and anaphora. S1 is seeded only with high-level information about goals of the interviewer and interviewee, and a small ontology; no grammar or other information is provided to S1 a priori. The agent learns the pragmatics, semantics, and syntax of complex utterances spoken and gestures from scratch, by observing the humans compare and contrast the cost and pollution related to recycling aluminum cans, glass bottles, newspaper, plastic, and wood. After 20 hours of observation S1 can perform an unscripted TV interview with a human, in the same style, without making mistakes.",

The common trait among these functions is that they implement local competition between small groups of computational units within a layer, so that only part of the network is activated for any given input pattern. In this paper, we attempt to visualize and understand this self-modularization, and suggest a unified explanation for the beneficial properties of such networks. We also show how our insights can be directly useful for efficiently performing retrieval over large datasets using neural networks.",

Its functionality is showcased by having our iCub humanoid robot pick-up objects from a table in front of it. An important feature is that the system can avoid obstacles - other objects detected in the visual stream - while reaching for the intended target object. Our integration also allows for non-static environments, i.e. the reaching is adapted on-the-fly from the visual feedback received, e.g. when an obstacle is moved into the trajectory. Furthermore we show that this system can be used both in autonomous and tele-operation scenarios.",

Experimental results are generally limited to toy scenarios, such as navigation in a simulated maze, or control of a simple mechanical system with one or two degrees of freedom. To study AC in a more realistic setting, we embody a curious agent in the complex iCub humanoid robot. Our novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework consists of a state-of-the-art, low-level, reactive control layer, which controls the iCub while respecting constraints, and a high-level curious agent, which explores the iCub's state-action space through information gain maximization, learning a world model from experience, controlling the actual iCub hardware in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever embodied, curious agent for real-time motion planning on a humanoid. We demonstrate that it can learn compact Markov models to represent large regions of the iCub's configuration space, and that the iCub explores intelligently, showing interest in its physical constraints as well as in objects it finds in its environment.",

We investigate whether the performance of state-of-the-art detection algorithms is comparable to the performance of humans, when they are compared under fair conditions: our test subjects were not previously exposed to the task, and were required to learn their own classification criteria solely by studying the same training set available to algorithms. We designed and implemented a standardized web-based test based on the publicly-available MITOS dataset, and compared results with the performance of the 6 top-scoring algorithms in the ICPR 2012 Mitosis Detection Contest.

The best individual (accuracy = 0.859 ± 0.012), is outperformed by the most accurate algorithm (accuracy = 0.873 ± 0.004).

By enhancing training efficiency and performance, this research could lead to more effective models that require less computational power, making advanced machine learning techniques more accessible. Furthermore, it could inspire future research into novel architectures and training methods, potentially leading to breakthroughs in deep learning applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent complexity of LSTM networks, which involve multiple gates and parameters that must be finely tuned. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate interactions between the gates, which can lead to issues such as exploding gradients or overfitting. Additionally, the computational burden of training LSTMs on large datasets can hinder experimentation with different architectures and hyperparameters. Overcoming these technical obstacles requires a deep understanding of both the theoretical underpinnings of LSTMs and practical strategies for efficient training.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has often focused on specific modifications to LSTM architectures or training methods without fully addressing the trade-offs between performance and computational efficiency. Limitations in computational resources and the complexity of hyperparameter tuning have also posed significant barriers. Many existing solutions have not systematically evaluated the impact of various architectural changes on performance across diverse datasets. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by conducting a comprehensive analysis of LSTM variants and their performance metrics, thereby providing clearer insights into effective modifications.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves a systematic evaluation of various LSTM architectures, including modifications such as the removal of output activation functions and coupling of input and forget gates. We will utilize benchmark datasets such as TIMIT and IAM Online for training and testing. The performance will be measured using metrics such as accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., training time and number of parameters). We expect to identify specific architectural changes that lead to improved performance while reducing computational complexity, ultimately contributing to more efficient LSTM training practices."

It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.",

In our EGO variant we use intrinsic Kriging (IK), which eliminates the need to estimate the parameters that quantify the trend in UK. In random simulation, EGO uses stochastic Kriging (SK), but we use stochastic IK (SIK). Moreover, in random simulation, EGO needs to select the number of replications per simulated input combination, accounting for the heteroscedastic variances of the simulation outputs. A popular selection method uses optimal computer budget allocation (OCBA), which allocates the available total number of replications over simulated combinations. We derive a new allocation algorithm. We perform several numerical experiments with deterministic simulations and random simulations.

In addition to those newly discovered thermoelectric materials, the present strategy is believed to be powerful for many other applications in which the chemistry of materials is required to be optimized."

While there have been many successes for BO in low dimensions, scaling it to high dimensions has been notoriously difficult. Existing literature on the topic are under very restrictive settings. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in this endeavour. We tackle these challenges by assuming an additive structure for the function. This setting is substantially more expressive and contains a richer class of functions than previous work. We prove that, for additive functions the regret has only linear dependence on $D$ even though the function depends on all $D$ dimensions. We also demonstrate several other statistical and computational benefits in our framework. Via synthetic examples, a scientific simulation and a face detection problem we demonstrate that our method outperforms naive BO on additive functions and on several examples where the function is not additive."

Several methods have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian optimization with constraints, based on the expected improvement (EI) heuristic. However, EI can lead to pathologies when used with constraints. For example, in the case of decoupled constraints--i.e., when one can independently evaluate the objective or the constraints--EI can encounter a pathology that prevents exploration. Additionally, computing EI requires a current best solution, which may not exist if none of the data collected so far satisfy the constraints. By contrast, informationbased approaches do not suffer from these failure modes. In this paper, we present a new information-based method called Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). We analyze the performance of PESC and show that it compares favorably to EI-based approaches on synthetic and benchmark problems, as well as several real-world examples. We demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization."

The use of GMRFs leads to sparse precision matrices, on which several sparse matrix techniques can be applied.

The ability to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior over functions, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example by optimizing in \"log-space,\" to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space.

Lastly, we propose an adaptation of a recently developed acquisition function, entropy search, to the cost-sensitive, multi-task setting.

We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation.

Expected improvement is perhaps the most popular method for solving this problem; the algorithm performs well in experiments, but little is known about its theoretical properties. Implementing expected improvement requires a choice of Gaussian process prior, which determines an associated space of functions, its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is fixed, expected improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in the RKHS. We begin by providing convergence rates for this procedure. The rates are optimal for functions of low smoothness, and we modify the algorithm to attain optimal rates for smoother functions. For practitioners, however, these results are somewhat misleading. Priors are typically not held fixed, but depend on parameters estimated from the data. For standard estimators, we show this procedure may never discover the minimum of f. We then propose alternative estimators, chosen to minimize the constants in the rate of convergence, and show these estimators retain the convergence rates of a fixed prior."

Wiley & Sons, 2007, 488 pp., US$83.60 (hardcover), ISBN 978-0-470-17155-4 Dynamic programming introduced by Bellman back in the 1950s offers a unified approach to solving problems arising in various applications, such as stochastic control or managing entire economies. The principles of dynamic programming have also been widely used in solving largescale stochastic reservoir models. However, due to the three curses of dimensionality, the sizes of a state space as well as the size of the outcome and action space typically grow exponentially in the number of state variables. Therefore, dynamic programming has limited practical applicability when used to find the exact solution of large-scale problems. One approach dealing with the curses of dimensionality is approximate dynamic programming. This book provides a unified and insightful treatment of approximate dynamic programming by integrating four distinct disciplines: Markov design processes, optimization, simulation, and statistics. Approximate Dynamic Programming is a comprehensive book that is designed to offer an introduction to the field. The book provides detailed coverage of modelling decision processes under uncertainty, robustness, designing and estimating value function approximations, choosing effective step-size rules, and convergence issues. In summary, the book Approximate Dynamic Programming is well written, highly pedagogical, with a clear and precise presentation of the material. Each chapter ends with bibliographic notes and well-selected problems that make this material an excellent textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. In addition, the author offers a companion webpage that includes additional problems and their solutions, as well as data sets to reinforce the book’s main concepts.

This policy myopically maximizes the expected increment in the value of information in each time period, where the value is measured according to the terminal utility function. We show that the knowledge-gradient policy is optimal both when the horizon is a single time period and in the limit as the horizon extends to infinity. We show furthermore that, in some special cases, the knowledge-gradient policy is optimal regardless of the length of any given fixed total sampling horizon. We bound the knowledge-gradient policy's suboptimality in the remaining cases, and show through simulations that it performs competitively with or significantly better than other policies."

The resulting model is easy to implement and can directly be used in combination with various existing extensions of the standard GPs such as sparse approximations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, including a challenging perception problem in robotics, show the effectiveness of most likely heteroscedastic GP regression."

This paper compares the performance of seven global optimization algorithms on a 14-parameter and an 8-parameter watershed calibration problem. The optimization algorithms include Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE), Differential Evolution (DE), an evolutionary algorithm that uses Radial Basis Function (RBF) approximation (ESGRBF), and four types of local optimization methods coupled with the Multi-Level Single Linkage (MLSL) multistart procedure. The four local optimization algorithms are: Sequential Quadratic Programming, which is a derivative-based method; Unconstrained Optimization by Quadratic Approximation (UOBYQA), which is a derivativefree trust-region method; Pattern Search; and Implicit Filtering. The results indicate that ESGRBF is the most effective algorithm on the two calibration problems, followed by Implicit Filtering coupled with the MLSL multistart approach. Hence, this study provides some promising alternatives to the currently most widely used methods in watershed calibration, which did not perform as well."

Although techniques for automating the process exist, most involve local function optimization procedures that suffer from three key drawbacks. Local optimization techniques are naturally plagued by local optima, make no use of the expensive gait evaluations once a local step is taken, and do not explicitly model noise in gait evaluation. These drawbacks increase the need for a large number of gait evaluations, making optimization slow, data inefficient, and manually intensive. We present a Bayesian approach based on Gaussian process regression that addresses all three drawbacks. It uses a global search strategy based on a posterior model inferred from all of the individual noisy evaluations. We demonstrate the technique on a quadruped robot, using it to optimize two different criteria: speed and smoothness. We show in both cases our technique requires dramatically fewer gait evaluations than state-of-the-art local gradient approaches."

This is achieved via the use of updating schemes based on new extensions of the expected improvement criterion commonly applied in single-objective searches. The approaches described provide a statistically coherent means of solving expensive multiobjective design problems using single-objective search tools. They are compared to the use of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-ii) based multiobjective searches, both with and without response surface support. The new approaches are shown to give more exact, wider ranging, and more evenly populated Pareto fronts than the genetic algorithm based searches at reduced or similar cost."

The results show that NSGA-II, a popular multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, performs well compared with random search, even within the restricted number of evaluations used. A significantly better performance (particularly, in the worst case) is, however, achieved on our test set by an algorithm proposed herein-ParEGO-which is an extension of the single-objective efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm of Jones et al. ParEGO uses a design-of-experiments inspired initialization procedure and learns a Gaussian processes model of the search landscape, which is updated after every function evaluation. Overall, ParEGO exhibits a promising performance for multiobjective optimization problems where evaluations are expensive or otherwise restricted in number."

GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other \"kernel machines\" popular in the community.

Recent Bayesian work considers opportunity cost and shows that an average case analysis may be less conservative but assumes a known output variance, an assumption that typically is violated in simulation. This paper presents new two-stage and sequential selection procedures that integrate attractive features of both lines of research. They are derived assuming that the simulation output is normally distributed with unknown mean and variance that may differ for each system. We permit the reduction of either opportunity cost loss or the probability of incorrect selection and allow for different replication costs for each system. The generality of our formulation comes at the expense of difficulty in obtaining exact closed-form solutions. We therefore derive a bound for the expected loss associated potentially incorrect selections, then asymptotically minimize that bound. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that our approach compares favorably with indifference-zone procedures."

Here, we extend this methodology by: (1) explicitly considering constraint equations in the optimization formulation, (2) showing that the optimal design for one environmental distribution is robust to alternate distributions, and (3) illustrating a sensitivity analysis technique to determine influential design and environmental factors. A thin midstem diameter with a short stabilizing distal tip minimized the bone remodeling signal while maintaining satisfactory stability. Hip joint force orientation was more influential than the effect of the controllable design variables on bone remodeling and the cancellous bone elastic modulus had the most influence on relative motion, both results indicating the importance of including uncontrollable environmental factors. The optimal search indicated that only 16 to 22 computer simulations were necessary to predict the optimal design, a significant savings over traditional search techniques."

These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements.

This is supported by theoretical results showing the optimality of random search under certain assumptions, but disagrees with other theoretical and empirical results showing that Bayesian optimization can lead to large gains in some situations. In light of this fact, we propose two research directions that we believe the community should pursue. First, we should focus on developing “harmless” Bayesian optimization methods that do no worse than random, and we propose a very simple “harmless” algorithm. Second, we should focus on developing first-order Bayesian optimization algorithms that use gradient information to improve performance for situations where Bayesian optimization already beats random. We empirically show the advantage of both of these ideas in simple simulations. We also propose a simple strategy for reducing the memory and computational requirements of existing first-order Bayesian optimization methods by using directional derivatives instead of full gradients, which can be obtained from analytic functions even when gradient code is not available."

The use of Gaussian processes allows us to benefit from the incorporation of prior knowledge about our objective function, and also from any derivative observations.

In the past fifty years, research in global optimization has produced many important approaches including Lipschitz optimization, simulated annealing, homotopy methods, genetic algorithms, and Bayesian response-surface methods. This work examines the last of these approaches. The Bayesian response-surface approach to global optimization maintains a posterior model of the function being optimized by combining a prior over functions with accumulating function evaluations. The model is then used to compute which point the method should acquire next in its search for the optimum of the function. Bayesian methods can be some of the most efficient approaches to optimization in terms of the number of function evaluations required, but they have significant drawbacks: Current approaches are needlessly data-inefficient, approximations to the Bayes-optimal acquisition criterion are poorly studied, and current approaches do not take advantage of the small-scale properties of differentiable functions near local optima. This work addresses each of these problems to make Bayesian methods more widely applicable."

A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal \"slice\" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such \"slice sampling\" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by \"overrelaxation,\" and for multivariate slice sampling by \"reflection\" from the edges of the slice."

Advances in the mathematical modeling of many physical processes, in algorithms for solving mathematical systems, and in computer speeds, have combined to make it possible to augment or replace physical experiments with computer experiments. In a computer experiment, a response z( x), usually deterministic, is computed for each set of input variables, x, according to an experimental design strategy. This strategy is determined by the goal of the experiment and depends, for example, on whether response prediction at unsampled input sites or response optimization is of primary interest. \nWe are concerned with the commonly occuring situation in which there are two types of input variables: suppose x = ( xc, x e) where xc is a set of “control” (manufacturing) variables and xe is a set of “environmental” (noise) variables. Manufacturing variables can be controlled while noise variables are not controllable but have values governed by some probability distribution. \nFor single response settings, we introduce a sequential experimental design for finding the optimum of e(x c) = E[z(x c, Xe)], where the expectation is taken over the distribution of the environmental variables. For bivariate response settings, we introduce a sequential experimental design for finding the constrained optimum of e1( xc)) = E[z( xc, X e)], subject to e2 (x c) = E[z2(x c, Xe)] ≤ U. The approach is Bayesian; the prior information is that the responses are a draw from a stationary Gaussian stochastic process with correlation function belonging to a parametric family with unknown parameters. The idea of the methods is to compute the posterior expected “improvement” over the current optimum for each untested site; the design selects the next site to maximize the expected improvement. Both procedures are illustrated by examples utilizing test functions from the numerical optimization literature."

By improving Bayesian optimization methods, researchers can tackle complex problems that involve expensive evaluations, leading to advancements in knowledge and practical applications such as optimizing hyperparameters in machine learning models or designing new materials. This could pave the way for more efficient algorithms and methodologies that can handle high-dimensional spaces, ultimately influencing future research directions and applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the high dimensionality of the function space and the computational expense associated with evaluating the objective functions. Naive approaches may fail because they do not adequately account for the uncertainty and noise in the function evaluations, leading to suboptimal exploration and exploitation strategies. Additionally, the complexity of modeling the underlying function with Gaussian processes can introduce theoretical and practical obstacles, such as the need for effective kernel selection and managing computational costs associated with large datasets.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has often focused on specific aspects of Bayesian optimization, such as single-task optimization or low-dimensional problems, leaving a gap in addressing high-dimensional and expensive function optimization comprehensively. Barriers include limitations in existing algorithms' scalability and their inability to efficiently handle noise and uncertainty in evaluations. My approach differs by integrating advanced techniques such as random embeddings and parallel optimization strategies, which can enhance the performance and applicability of Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional settings.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nMy proposed methodology involves utilizing a combination of Gaussian process regression and random embeddings to optimize high-dimensional functions.

We propose an alternative approach which instead relies on a single 2D convolutional neural network across both sequences.

Our model yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems, while being conceptually simpler and having fewer parameters.",
            "introduction": " Introduction Deep neural networks have made a profound im- pact on natural language processing technology in general, and machine translation in particu- lar (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2015; LeCun et al., 2015). Machine translation (MT) can be seen as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, where the source and target sequences are of different and variable length. Current state-of-the-art approaches are based on encoder- decoder architectures (Kalchbrenner and Blun- som, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). The encoder “reads” the variable-length source sequence and maps it into a vector representation. The decoder takes this vector as input and “writes” the target sequence, updating its state each step with the most recent word that it generated. The basic encoder-decoder model is generally equipped with an attention model (Bahdanau et al., 2015), which repetitivelyre-accesses the source sequence during the decod- ing process. Given the current state of the decoder, a probability distribution over the elements in the source sequence is computed, which is then used to select or aggregate features of these elements into a single “context” vector that is used by the decoder. Rather than relying on the global rep- resentation of the source sequence, the attention mechanism allows the decoder to “look back” into the source sequence and focus on salient positions. Besides this inductive bias, the attention mecha- nism bypasses the problem of vanishing gradients that most recurrent architectures encounter. However, the current attention mechanisms have limited modeling abilities and are generally a simple weighted sum of the source representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015), where the weights are the result of a shallow matching between source and target elements. The atten- tion module re-combines the same source token codes and is unable to re-encode or re-interpret the source sequence while decoding. To address these limitations, we propose an al- ternative neural MT architecture, based on deep 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The product space of the positions in source and tar- get sequences deﬁnes the 2D grid over which the network is deﬁned.

We extend beyond the current sequence to sequence backbone NMT models to a 2D structure in which the source and target sentences are aligned with each other in a 2D grid.

Attention networks are an easy-to-train and effective method for softly simulating alignment; however, the approach does not marginalize over latent alignments in a probabilistic sense. This property makes it difficult to compare attention to other alignment approaches, to compose it with probabilistic models, and to perform posterior inference conditioned on observed data. A related latent approach, hard attention, fixes these issues, but is generally harder to train and less accurate. This work considers variational attention networks, alternatives to soft and hard attention for learning latent variable alignment models, with tighter approximation bounds based on amortized variational inference. We further propose methods for reducing the variance of gradients to make these approaches computationally feasible. Experiments show that for machine translation and visual question answering, inefficient exact latent variable models outperform standard neural attention, but these gains go away when using hard attention based training. On the other hand, variational attention retains most of the performance gain but with training speed comparable to neural attention."

Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited models and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google's phrase-based production system."

Previous work addresses the translation of out-of-vocabulary words by backing off to a dictionary. In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively."

This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems that already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures yields a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT’15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker. 1"

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters."

In this paper, we propose a method based on importance sampling that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models.

Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.

One of the key challenges in sequence transduction is learning to represent both the input and output sequences in a way that is invariant to sequential distortions such as shrinking, stretching and translating. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful sequence learning architecture that has proven capable of learning such representations. However RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between the input and output sequences to perform transduction. This is a severe limitation since \\emph{finding} the alignment is the most difficult aspect of many sequence transduction problems. Indeed, even determining the length of the output sequence is often challenging. This paper introduces an end-to-end, probabilistic sequence transduction system, based entirely on RNNs, that is in principle able to transform any input sequence into any finite, discrete output sequence.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1.

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods.

                    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have massively impacted visual recognition in 2D images, and are now ubiquitous in state-of-the-art approaches. While CNNs naturally extend to other domains, such as audio and video, where data is also organized in rectangular grids, they do not easily generalize to other types of data such as 3D shape meshes, social network graphs or molecular graphs. To handle such data, we propose a novel graph-convolutional network architecture that builds on a generic formulation that relaxes the 1-to-1 correspondence between filter weights and data elements around the center of the convolution. The main novelty of our architecture is that the shape of the filter is a function of the features in the previous network layer, which is learned as an integral part of the neural network. Experimental evaluations on digit recognition, semi-supervised document classification, and 3D shape correspondence yield state-of-the-art results, significantly improving over previous work for shape correspondence.",
                    "For sake of brevity we reported only the three metrics that are most commonly used in the recent captioning literature in the main paper, the same three as in e.g . [1, 8, 11]. While the evaluation of caption quality remains a challenging issue, the CIDEr-D metric [7] is generally considered to be correlating the best to human judgement. The BLEU metrics [6] are based on N-gram matching statistics. In particular, the BLEU1 metric completely disregards word ordering, and is thus of little interest to measure sentence quality. From the BLEU measures, BLEU4 (based on 4-grams) is most commonly used [7]. In tables 1, 2, and 3 provide the evaluation results including the BLEU 1–3 metrics. The conclusion of the comparisons among the variants of our model and to the state of the art remain unchanged. The tables here correspond to those with the same numbers in the main paper. We refer to the main paper for a full description of the experimental setup.",
                    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have massively impacted visual recognition in 2D images, and are now ubiquitous in state-of-the-art approaches. CNNs do not easily extend, however, to data that are not represented by regular grids, such as 3D shape meshes or other graph-structured data, to which traditional local convolution operators do not directly apply. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-convolution operator to establish correspondences between filter weights and graph neighborhoods with arbitrary connectivity. The key novelty of our approach is that these correspondences are dynamically computed from features learned by the network, rather than relying on predefined static coordinates over the graph as in previous work. We obtain excellent experimental results that significantly improve over previous state-of-the-art shape correspondence results. This shows that our approach can learn effective shape representations from raw input coordinates, without relying on shape descriptors.",
                    "Despite the success of CNNs, selecting the optimal architecture for a given task remains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture, we propose a \"fabric\" that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size. We present benchmark results competitive with the state of the art for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR10, and for semantic segmentation on the Part Labels dataset.",
                    "This thesis gives an overview of my research since my arrival in December 2005 as a postdoctoral fellow at the in the LEAR team at INRIA Rhone-Alpes. After a general introduction in Chapter 1, the contributions are presented in chapters 2–4 along three themes. In each chapter we describe the contributions, their relation to related work, and highlight two contributions with more detail. Chapter 2 is concerned with contributions related to the Fisher vector representation. We highlight an extension of the representation based on modeling dependencies among local descriptors (Cinbis et al., 2012, 2016a). The second highlight is on an approximate normalization scheme which speeds-up applications for object and action localization (Oneata et al., 2014b). In Chapter 3 we consider the contributions related to metric learning. The first contribution we highlight is a nearest-neighbor based image annotation method that learns weights over neighbors, and effectively determines the number of neighbors to use (Guillaumin et al., 2009a). The second contribution we highlight is an image classification method based on metric learning for the nearest class mean classifier that can efficiently generalize to new classes (Mensink et al., 2012, 2013b). The third set of contributions, presented in Chapter 4, is related to learning visual recognition models from incomplete supervision. The first highlighted contribution is an interactive image annotation method that exploits dependencies across different image labels, to improve predictions and to identify the most informative user input (Mensink et al., 2011, 2013a). The second highlighted contribution is a multi-fold multiple instance learning method for learning object localization models from training images where we only know if the object is present in the image or not (Cinbis et al., 2014, 2016b). Finally, Chapter 5 summarizes the contributions, and presents future research directions.",
                    "Deep convolutional neural networks have recently proven extremely effective for difficult face recognition problems in uncontrolled settings. To train such networks, very large training sets are needed with millions of labeled images. For some applications, such as near-infrared (NIR) face recognition, such large training data sets are not publicly available and difficult to collect. In this paper, we propose a method to generate very large training data sets of synthetic images by compositing real face images in a given data set. We show that this method enables to learn models from as few as 10 000 training images, which perform on par with models trained from 500 000 images. Using our approach, we also obtain state-of-the-art results on the CASIA NIR-VIS2.0 heterogeneous face recognition data set.",
                    "We propose “Areas of Attention”, a novel attentionbased model for automatic image captioning. Our approach models the dependencies between image regions, caption words, and the state of an RNN language model, using three pairwise interactions. In contrast to previous attentionbased approaches that associate image regions only to the RNN state, our method allows a direct association between caption words and image regions. During training these associations are inferred from image-level captions, akin to weakly-supervised object detector training. These associations help to improve captioning by localizing the corresponding regions during testing. We also propose and compare different ways of generating attention areas: CNN activation grids, object proposals, and spatial transformers nets applied in a convolutional fashion. Spatial transformers give the best results. They allow for image specific attention areas, and can be trained jointly with the rest of the network. Our attention mechanism and spatial transformer attention areas together yield state-of-the-art results on the MSCOCO dataset.",
                    "Adversarial training has been shown to produce state of the art results for generative image modeling. In this paper we propose an adversarial training approach to train semantic segmentation models. We train a convolutional semantic segmentation network along with an adversarial network that discriminates segmentation maps coming either from the ground truth or from the segmentation network. The motivation for our approach is that it can detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between ground truth segmentation maps and the ones produced by the segmentation net. Our experiments show that our adversarial training approach leads to improved accuracy on the Stanford Background and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.",
                    "Object category localization is a challenging problem in computer vision. Standard supervised training requires bounding box annotations of object instances. This time-consuming annotation process is sidestepped in weakly supervised learning. In this case, the supervised information is restricted to binary labels that indicate the absence/presence of object instances in the image, without their locations. We follow a multiple-instance learning approach that iteratively trains the detector and infers the object locations in the positive training images. Our main contribution is a multi-fold multiple instance learning procedure, which prevents training from prematurely locking onto erroneous object locations. This procedure is particularly important when using high-dimensional representations, such as Fisher vectors and convolutional neural network features. We also propose a window refinement method, which improves the localization accuracy by incorporating an objectness prior. We present a detailed experimental evaluation using the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, which verifies the effectiveness of our approach.",
                    "Mahalanobis metric learning amounts to learning a linear data projection, after which the ℓ2 metric is used to compute distances. To allow more flexible metrics, not restricted to linear projections, local metric learning techniques have been developed. Most of these methods partition the data space using clustering, and for each cluster a separate metric is learned. Using local metrics, however, it is not clear how to measure distances between data points assigned to different clusters. In this paper we propose to embed the local metrics in a global low-dimensional representation, in which the ℓ2 metric can be used. With each cluster we associate a linear mapping that projects the data to the global representation. This global representation directly allows computing distances between points regardless to which local cluster they belong. Moreover, it also enables data visualization in a single view, and the use of ℓ2-based efficient retrieval methods. Experiments on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset show that our approach improves over previous global and local metric learning approaches.",
                    "We describe the submission of the INRIA LEAR team to the THU-MOS workshop in conjunction with ECCV 2014. Our system is based on Fisher vector (FV) encoding of dense trajectory features (DTF), which we also used in our 2013 submission. This year's submission additionally incorporates static-image features (SIFT, Color, and CNN) and audio features (ASR and MFCC) for the classification task. For the detection task, we combine scores from the clas-sification task with FV-DTF features extracted from video slices. We found that these additional visual and audio feature significantly improve the classification results. For localization we found that using the classification scores as a contex-tual feature besides local motion features leads to significant improvements.",
                    "This paper describes our participation to the 2014 edition of the TrecVid Multimedia Event Detection task. Our system is based on a collection of local visual and audio descriptors, which are aggregated to global descriptors, one for each type of low-level descriptor, using Fisher vectors. Besides these features, we use two features based on convolutional networks: one for the visual channel, and one for the audio channel. Additional high-level featuresare extracted using ASR and OCR features. Finally, we used mid-level attribute features based on object and action detectors trained on external datasets. Our two submissions (INRIA-LIM-VocR and AXES) are identical interms of all the components, except for the ASR system that is used. We present an overview of the features andthe classification techniques, and experimentally evaluate our system on TrecVid MED 2011 data.",

Our interactive INS focused this year on using classifiers trained at query time with positive examples collected from external search engines. Participants in our INS experiments were carried out by students and researchers at Dublin City University. Our best INS runs performed on par with the top ranked INS runs in terms of P@10 and P@30, and around the median in terms of mAP.  For SIN, MED and MER, we use systems based on state- of-the-art local low-level descriptors for motion, image, and sound, as well as high-level features to capture speech and text and the visual and audio stream respectively. The low-level descriptors were aggregated by means of Fisher vectors into high- dimensional video-level signatures, the high-level features are aggregated into bag-of-word histograms. Using these features we train linear classifiers, and use early and late-fusion to combine the different features. Our MED system achieved the best score of all submitted runs in the main track, as well as in the ad-hoc track.  This paper describes in detail our INS, MER, and MED systems and the results and findings of our experiments.",
                    "The AXES project participated in the interactive instance search task (INS), the known-item search task (KIS), and the multimedia event detection task (MED) for TRECVid 2012. As in our TRECVid 2011 system, we used nearly identical search systems and user interfaces for both INS and KIS. Our interactive INS and KIS systems focused this year on using classifiers trained at query time with positive examples collected from external search engines. Participants in our KIS experiments were media professionals from the BBC; our INS experiments were carried out by students and researchers at Dublin City University. We performed comparatively well in both experiments. Our best KIS run found 13 of the 25 topics, and our best INS runs outperformed all other submitted runs in terms of P@100. For MED, the system presented was based on a minimal number of low-level descriptors, which we chose to be as large as computationally feasible. These descriptors are aggregated to produce high-dimensional video-level signatures, which are used to train a set of linear classifiers. Our MED system achieved the second-best score of all submitted runs in the main track, and best score in the ad-hoc track, suggesting that a simple system based on state-of-the-art low-level descriptors can give relatively high performance. This paper describes in detail our KIS, INS, and MED systems and the results and findings of our experiments.",
                    "Image classification is a challenging problem due to intra-class appearance variation, background clutter, occlusion, and photometric variability. Current state-of-the-art methods do not explicitly handle background clutter, but rely on global image representations, such as bag-of-word (BoW) models. Multiple-instance learning has been used to explicitly deal with clutter, classifying an image positively as soon as at least one image region is classified positively. In this paper, we propose a more robust latent-SVM model that, unlike multiple-instance learning, does not rely on a single image region to trigger a positive image classification. Rather, our model scores an images using all regions, and associates with each region a latent variable that indicates whether the region represents the object of interest or its background. Background and foreground regions are each scored by a different appearance model, and an additional term in the score function ensures that neighboring regions tend to take the same background/foreground label. We learn the parameters of our latent SVM model using an iterative procedure that alternates between inferring the latent variables, and updating the parameters. We compare the performance of our approach on the PASCAL VOC'07 dataset to that of SVMs trained on global BoW representations, and to a multiple-instance SVM trained on BoW representations of image regions. We show that our approach outperforms multiple-instance learning by a large margin on all classes, and outperforms global BoW models in 17 out of the 20 classes.",
                    "Currently large scale multimodal image databases have become widely available, for example via photo sharing sites where images come along with textual descriptions and keyword annotations. Most existing work on image retrieval and image auto-annotation has considered uni-modal techniques, either focusing on query-by-example systems or query-by-text systems for image retrieval, and mono modal classification for image auto-annotation. However recent state-of-the-art multimodal image retrieval and image auto-annotation systems combine different uni-modal models using late-fusion techniques. In addition, significant advances have been made by using pseudo-relevance feedback techniques, as well as using transmedia relevance models that swap modalities in the query expansion step of pseudo-relevance methods. While these techniques are promising it is not trivial to set the parameters that control the late fusion and pseudo/cross relevance models. In this paper, we therefore propose approaches to learn these parameters from a labeled training set: queries with relevant and non-relevant documents, or images with relevant and non-relevant keywords. Three additional contributions are the introduction of (i) two new parameterizations of transmedia and pseudo-relevance models, (ii) correction parameters for inter-query variations in the distribution of retrieval scores for both relevant and non-relevant documents, and (iii) the extension of TagProp, a nearest neighbor based image annotation method to exploit transmedia relevance feedback. We evaluate our models using public benchmark data sets for image retrieval and annotation. Using the data set of the ImageClef 2008 Photo Retrieval task, our retrieval experiments show that our learned models lead to significant improvements of retrieval performance over the current state-of-the-art. In our experiments on image annotation we use the COREL and IAPR data sets, and also here we observe annotation accuracies that improve over the current state-of-the-art results on these data sets.",
                    "Current state-of-the-art image categorization systems rely on bag-of-words representations that model image content as a histogram of quantization indices that code local image appearance. In this context, randomized tree-structured quantizers have been shown to be both computationally efficient and yielding discriminative visual words for a given categorization task. This paper presents a new algorithm that builds tree-structured quantizers not to optimize patch classification ‐ as it is done by approaches such as [18] ‐ but to directly optimize the image classification performance. This approach is experimentally validated on several challenging data sets for which it outperforms other patch quantizers such as standard decision trees or k-means."

This research could pave the way for future innovations in MT and related areas, potentially impacting applications in real-time translation, cross-lingual communication, and multilingual content generation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent complexity of accurately modeling the relationships between variable-length source and target sequences.

Additionally, the limitations of existing attention mechanisms, which do not allow for re-encoding or re-interpretation of the source sequence during decoding, pose significant technical obstacles that need to be addressed.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on improving attention mechanisms through incremental adjustments rather than fundamentally rethinking their architecture.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.",
            "introduction": " Introduction Deep learning has dramatically advanced the state of the art in vision, speech, and many other areas. Stochas- tic gradient descent (SGD) has proved to be an effec- tive way of training deep networks, and SGD variants such as momentum (Sutskeveret al., 2013) and Adagrad (Duchiet al.,2011)havebeenusedtoachievestate ofthe art performance.

First,thegradient ofthelossoveramini-batchisanestimateofthegradient overthetrainingset, whose qualityimprovesas thebatch size increases. Second, computation over a batch can be much more efﬁcient than mcomputations for individual examples, due to the parallelism afforded by the modern computingplatforms. While stochastic gradient is simple and effective, it requires careful tuning of the model hyper-parameters, speciﬁcallythelearningrateusedinoptimization,aswell as the initial values for the model parameters. The train- ingiscomplicatedbythefactthattheinputstoeachlayer areaffectedbytheparametersofallprecedinglayers–so that small changes to the network parameters amplify as thenetworkbecomesdeeper. The change in the distributions of layers’ inputs presents a problem because the layers need to continu- ously adapt to the new distribution. When the input dis- tributiontoalearningsystemchanges,itissaidtoexperi- encecovariateshift (Shimodaira, 2000). This is typically handled via domain adaptation (Jiang, 2008). However, the notion of covariate shift can be extended beyond the learningsystemasawhole,toapplytoitsparts,suchasa sub-networkora layer. Considera networkcomputing ℓ=F2(F1(u,Θ1),Θ2) whereF1andF2are arbitrary transformations, and the parameters Θ1,Θ2are to be learned so as to minimize the lossℓ. Learning Θ2can be viewed as if the inputs x =F1(u,Θ1)arefedintothesub-network ℓ=F2(x,Θ2). Forexample,agradientdescentstep Θ2←Θ2−α mm/summationdisplay i=1∂F2(xi,Θ2) ∂Θ2 (forbatchsize mandlearningrate α)isexactlyequivalent to that for a stand-alone network F2with input x. There- fore, the input distribution properties that make training more efﬁcient – such as having the same distribution be- tween the training and test data – apply to training the sub-network as well. As such it is advantageous for the distributionof xtoremainﬁxedovertime. Then, Θ2does 1not have to readjust to compensate for the change in the distributionof x. Fixed distribution of inputs to a sub-network would havepositiveconsequencesforthelayers outsidethesub- network,as well. Consider a layer with a sigmoid activa- tion function z =g(Wu+b)whereuis the layer input, the weight matrix Wand bias vector bare the layer pa- rameters to be learned, and g(x) =1 1+exp(−x). As|x| increases, g′(x)tends to zero. This means that for all di- mensionsof x =Wu+bexceptthosewithsmallabsolute values,thegradientﬂowingdownto uwillvanishandthe model will train slowly. However, since xis affected by W,band the parameters of all the layers below, changes tothoseparametersduringtrainingwilllikelymovemany dimensions of xinto the saturated regime of the nonlin- earity and slow down the convergence. This effect is ampliﬁed as the network depth increases.

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters."

In experiments, fractal networks match the excellent performance of standard residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, thereby demonstrating that residual representations may not be fundamental to the success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks. Rather, the key may be the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep. We note similarities with student-teacher behavior and develop drop-path, a natural extension of dropout, to regularize co-adaptation of subpaths in fractal architectures. Such regularization allows extraction of high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks.

We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos."

The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance.

One major challenge is endowing machines with human ability to recognize tens of thousands of categories. Moving beyond previous work that is mostly focused on hundreds of categories we make progress toward human scale visual recognition. Specifically, our contributions are as follows First, we have constructed ImageNet, a large scale image ontology. The Fall 2011 version consists of 22 thousand categories and 14 million images; it depicts each category by an average of 650 images collected from the Internet and verified by multiple humans. To the best of our knowledge this is currently the largest human-verified dataset in terms of both the number of categories and the number of images. Given the large amount of human effort required, the traditional approach to dataset collection, involving in-house annotation by a small number of human subjects, becomes infeasible. In this dissertation we describe how ImageNet has been built through quality controlled, cost effective, large scale online crowdsourcing. Next, we use ImageNet to conduct the first benchmarking study of state of the art recognition algorithms at the human scale. By experimenting on 10 thousand categories, we discover that the previous state of the art performance is still low (6.4%). We further observe that the confusion among categories is hierarchically structured at large scale, a key insight that leads to our subsequent contributions. Third, we study how to efficiently classify tens of thousands of categories by exploiting the structure of visual confusion among categories. We propose a novel learning technique that scales logarithmically with the number of classes in both training and testing, improving both accuracy and efficiency of the previous state of the art while reducing training time by 31 fold on 10 thousand classes."

By making use of our convergence analysis, we obtain good results on a large-scale continuous handwriting recognition task with a simple and generic approach."

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms."

These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an infinite number of copies that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative biases. The learning and inference rules for these \"Stepped Sigmoid Units\" are unchanged. They can be approximated efficiently by noisy, rectified linear units. Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Unlike binary units, rectified linear units preserve information about relative intensities as information travels through multiple layers of feature detectors."

                    "abstract": "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a “better” basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact)."

We then show that normalization of each coefficient by the square root of a linear combination of the amplitudes of the coefficients in the cluster reduces statistical dependencies. We further show that the resulting divisive normalization transform is invertible and provide an efficient iterative inversion algorithm. Finally, we probe the statistical and perceptual advantages of this image representation by examining its robustness to added noise, and using it to enhance image contrast."

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

However, some special kinds of domain adaptation problems have been studied before under different names such as class imbalance [Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002], covariate shift [Shimodaira, 2000], and sample selection bias [Heckman, 1979]. There are also some well-studied machine learning problems that are closely related but not equivalent to domain adaptation, including multi-task learning [Caruana, 1997] and semi-supervised learning [Chapelle et al., 2006]. In this literature survey, we review existing work in both the machine learning and the natural language processing communities related to domain adaptation. Because this relatively new topic is constantly attracting attention, our survey is necessarily incomplete. Nevertheless, we try to cover the major lines of work that we are aware of up to the date this survey is written. This survey will also be constantly updated. The goal of this literature survey is twofold. First, existing studies on domain adaptation seem very different from each other, and different terms are used to refer to the problem. There has not been any survey that connects these different studies. This survey thus tries to organize the existing work in a systematic way and draw a big picture of the domain adaptation problem with its possible solutions. Second, a systematic literature survey shows the limitations of current work and points out promising directions that should be explored."

                    "The image auto rectification project at Google aims to create a pleasanter version of user photos by correcting the small, involuntary camera rotations (roll / pitch/ yaw) that often occur in non-professional photographs. Our system takes the image closer to the fronto-parallel view by performing an affine rectification on the image that restores parallelism of lines that are parallel in the fronto-parallel image view. This partially corrects perspective distortions, but falls short of full metric rectification which also restores angles between lines. On the other hand the 2D homography for our rectification can be computed from only two (as opposed to three) estimated vanishing points, allowing us to fire upon many more images. A new RANSAC based approach to vanishing point estimation has been developed. The main strength of our vanishing point detector is that it is line-less, thereby avoiding the hard, binary (line/no-line) upstream decisions that cause traditional algorithm to ignore much supporting evidence and/or admit noisy evidence for vanishing points. A robust RANSAC based technique for detecting horizon lines in an image is also proposed for analyzing correctness of the estimated rectification. We post-multiply our affine rectification homography with a 2D rotation which aligns the closer vanishing point with the image Y axis.",
                    "Personal photo albums are heavily biased towards faces of people, but most state-of-the-art algorithms for image denoising and noise estimation do not exploit facial information. We propose a novel technique for jointly estimating noise levels of all face images in a photo collection. Photos in a personal album are likely to contain several faces of the same people. While some of these photos would be clean and high quality, others may be corrupted by noise. Our key idea is to estimate noise levels by comparing multiple images of the same content that differ predominantly in their noise content. Specifically, we compare geometrically and photo metrically aligned face images of the same person. Our estimation algorithm is based on a probabilistic formulation that seeks to maximize the joint probability of estimated noise levels across all images. We propose an approximate solution that decomposes this joint maximization into a two-stage optimization. The first stage determines the relative noise between pairs of images by pooling estimates from corresponding patch pairs in a probabilistic fashion. The second stage then jointly optimizes for all absolute noise parameters by conditioning them upon relative noise levels, which allows for a pair wise factorization of the probability distribution. We evaluate our noise estimation method using quantitative experiments to measure accuracy on synthetic data. Additionally, we employ the estimated noise levels for automatic denoising using \"BM3D\", and evaluate the quality of denoising on real-world photos through a user study.",

Specifically, we show that a significant performance gain could be obtained by combining convolutional architectures with approximate top-$k$ ranking objectives, as thye naturally fit the multilabel tagging problem. Our experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset outperforms the conventional visual features by about 10%, obtaining the best reported performance in the literature.",
                    "Simultaneously segmenting and labeling images is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical CRF model to deal with the problem of labeling images of street scenes by several distinctive object classes. In addition to learning a CRF model from all the labeled images, we group images into clusters of similar images and learn a CRF model from each cluster separately. When labeling a new image, we pick the closest cluster and use the associated CRF model to label this image. Experimental results show that this hierarchical image labeling method is comparable to, and in many cases superior to, previous methods on benchmark data sets. In addition to segmentation and labeling results, we also showed how to apply the image labeling result to rerank Google similar images.",
                    "We address the problem of large-scale annotation of web images. Our approach is based on the concept of visual synset, which is an organization of images which are visually-similar and semantically-related. Each visual synset represents a single prototypical visual concept, and has an associated set of weighted annotations. Linear SVM's are utilized to predict the visual synset membership for unseen image examples, and a weighted voting rule is used to construct a ranked list of predicted annotations from a set of visual synsets. We demonstrate that visual synsets lead to better performance than standard methods on a new annotation database containing more than 200 million im- ages and 300 thousand annotations, which is the largest ever reported",
                    "We propose a new Consistent Weighted Sampling method, where the probability of drawing identical samples for a pair of inputs is equal to their Jaccard similarity. Our method takes deterministic constant time per non-zero weight, improving on the best previous approach which takes expected constant time. The samples can be used as Weighted Minhash for efficient retrieval and compression (sketching) under Jaccard or L1 metric. A method is presented for using simple data statistics to reduce the running time of hash computation by two orders of magnitude. We compare our method with the random projection method and show that it has better characteristics for retrieval under L1. We present a novel method of mapping hashes to short bit-strings, apply it to Weighted Minhash, and achieve more accurate distance estimates from sketches than existing methods, as long as the inputs are sufficiently distinct. We show how to choose the optimal number of bits per hash for sketching, and demonstrate experimental results which agree with the theoretical analysis.",
                    "The combination of MinHash-based signatures and locality- sensitive hashing (LSH) schemes has been effectively used for finding approximate matches in very large audio and image retrieval systems. In this study, we introduce the idea of permutation-grouping to intelligently design the hash functions that are used to index the LSH tables. This helps to overcome the inefficiencies introduced by hashing real-world data that is noisy, structured, and most importantly is not independently and identically distributed. Through extensive tests, we find that permutation-grouping dramatically increases the efficiency of the overall retrieval system by lowering the number of low-probability candidates that must be examined by 30-50%.",
                    "Red-eye is a problem in photography that occurs when a photograph is taken with a flash, and the bright flash light is reflected from the blood vessels in the eye, giving the eye an unnatural red hue. Most red-eye reduction systems need the user to outline the red eyes by hand, but this approach doesn't scale up. Instead, we propose an automatic red-eye detection system. The system contains a red-eye detector that finds red eye-like candidate image patches; a state of the art face detector used to eliminate most false positives (image regions that look but red eyes but are not); and a red-eye outline detector. All three detectors are automatically learned from data, using Boosting. Our system can be combined with a red-eye reduction module to yield a fully automatic red eye corrector.",
                    "Efficient detection of objects in images is complicated by variations of object appearance due to intra-class object differences, articulation, lighting, occlusions, and aspect variations. To reduce the search required for detection, we employ the bottom-up approach where we find candidate image features and associate some of them with parts of the object model. We represent objects as collections of local features, and would like to allow any of them to be absent, with only a small subset sufficient for detection;furthermore, our model should allow efficient correspondence search. We propose a model, Mixture of Trees, that achieves these goals. With a mixture of trees, we can model the individual appearances of the features, relationships among them, and the aspect, and handle occlusions. Independences captured in the model make efficient inference possible. In our earlier work, we have shown that mixtures of trees can be used to model objects with a natural tree structure, in the context of human tracking. Now we show that a natural tree structure is not required, and use a mixture of trees for both frontal and view-invariant face detection. We also show that by modeling faces as collections of features we can establish an intrinsic coordinate frame for a face, and estimate the out-of-plane rotation of a face.",
                    "Tree-structured probabilistic models admit simple, fast inference. However they are not well suited to phenonena such as occlusion, where multiple components of an object may disappear simultaneously. We address this problem with mixtures of trees, and demonstrate an efficient and compact representation of this mixture, which admits simple learning and inference algorithms. We use this method to build an automated tracker for Muybridge sequences of a variety of human activities. Tracking is difficult, because the temporal dependencies rule out simple inference methods. We show how to use our model for efficient inference, using a method that employs alternate spatial and temporal inference. The result is a cracker that (a) uses a very loose motion model, and so can track many different activities at a variable frame rate and (b) is entirely, automatic.",
                    "Formulates structure from motion as a Bayesian inference problem and uses a Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampler to sample the posterior on this problem. This results in a method that can identify both small and large tracker errors and yields reconstructions that are stable in the presence of these errors. Furthermore, the method gives detailed information on the range of ambiguities in structure given a particular data set and requires no special geometric formulation to cope with degenerate situations. Motion segmentation is obtained by a layer of discrete variables associating a point with an object. We demonstrate a sampler that successfully samples an approximation to the marginal on this domain, producing a relatively unambiguous segmentation.",
                    "We show how to use a sampling method to find sparsely clad people in static images. People are modeled as an assembly of nine cylindrical segments. Segments are found using an EM algorithm and then assembled into hypotheses incrementally, using a learned likelihood model. Each assembly step passes on a set of samples of its likelihood to the next; this yields effective pruning of the space of hypotheses. The collection of available nine-segment hypotheses is then represented by a set of equivalence classes, which yield an efficient pruning process. The posterior for the number of people is obtained from the class representatives. People are counted quite accurately in images of real scenes using a MAP estimate. We show the method allows top-down as well as bottom up reasoning. While the method can be overwhelmed by very large numbers of segments, we show that this problem can be avoided by quite simple pruning steps.",
                    "Finding articulated objects, like people, in pictures presents a particularly difficult object recognition problem. We show how to find people by finding putative body segments, and then constructing assemblies of those segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to present every group to a classifier. Instead, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.",

The method is based on the notion of temporal differences, and is primarily geared to the case of large and complex problems where the use of approximations is essential. We develop the theory of the method without approximation, we describe how to embed it within a neuro-dynamic programming/reinforcement learning context where feature-based approximation architectures are used, we relate it to TD(λ) methods, and we illustrate its use in the training of a tetris playing program. 1 Supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant DDM-8903385 and Grant CCR9103804.

                    "Current high-quality object detection approaches use the scheme of salience-based object proposal methods followed by post-classification using deep convolutional features. This spurred recent research in improving object proposal methods. However, domain agnostic proposal generation has the principal drawback that the proposals come unranked or with very weak ranking, making it hard to trade-off quality for running time. This raises the more fundamental question of whether high-quality proposal generation requires careful engineering or can be derived just from data alone. We demonstrate that learning-based proposal methods can effectively match the performance of hand-engineered methods while allowing for very efficient runtime-quality trade-offs. Using the multi-scale convolutional MultiBox (MSC-MultiBox) approach, we substantially advance the state-of-the-art on the ILSVRC 2014 detection challenge data set, with $0.5$ mAP for a single model and $0.52$ mAP for an ensemble of two models. MSC-Multibox significantly improves the proposal quality over its predecessor MultiBox~method: AP increases from $0.42$ to $0.53$ for the ILSVRC detection challenge. Finally, we demonstrate improved bounding-box recall compared to Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping with less proposals on the Microsoft-COCO data set.",
                    "Current state-of-the-art deep learning systems for visual object recognition and detection use purely supervised training with regularization such as dropout to avoid overfitting. The performance depends critically on the amount of labeled examples, and in current practice the labels are assumed to be unambiguous and accurate. However, this assumption often does not hold; e.g. in recognition, class labels may be missing; in detection, objects in the image may not be localized; and in general, the labeling may be subjective. In this work we propose a generic way to handle noisy and incomplete labeling by augmenting the prediction objective with a notion of consistency. We consider a prediction consistent if the same prediction is made given similar percepts, where the notion of similarity is between deep network features computed from the input data. In experiments we demonstrate that our approach yields substantial robustness to label noise on several datasets. On MNIST handwritten digits, we show that our model is robust to label corruption. On the Toronto Face Database, we show that our model handles well the case of subjective labels in emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the- art results, and can also benefit from unlabeled face images with no modification to our method. On the ILSVRC2014 detection challenge data, we show that our approach extends to very deep networks, high resolution images and structured outputs, and results in improved scalable detection.",
                    "Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently misclassify adversarial examples---inputs formed by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.",

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing.

The winning model on the localization sub-task was a network that predicts a single bounding box and a confidence score for each object category in the image. Such a model captures the whole-image context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same object in the image without naively replicating the number of outputs for each instance. In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural network model for detection, which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding boxes along with a single score for each box, corresponding to its likelihood of containing any object of interest. The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network. We are able to obtain competitive recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using only the top few predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural network evaluations.",

                    "Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties.  First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks.  Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.",
                    "We study modular, automatic code generation from hierarchical block diagrams with synchronous semantics. Such diagrams are the fundamental model behind widespread tools in the embedded software domain, such as Simulink and SCADE. Code is modular in the sense that it is generated for a given composite block independently from context (i.e., without knowing in which diagrams the block is to be used) and using minimal information about the internals of the block. In previous work, we have shown how modular code can be generated by computing a set of interface functions for each block and a set of dependencies between these functions that is exported along with the interface. We have also introduced a quantified notion of modularity in terms of the number of interface functions generated per block, and showed how to minimize this number, which is essential for scalability. Finally, we have exposed the fundamental trade-off between modularity and reusability (set of diagrams the block can be used in).  In this paper we explore another trade-off: modularity vs. code size. We show that our previous technique, although it achieves maximal reusability and is optimal in terms of modularity, may result in code replication and therefore large code sizes, something often unacceptable in an embedded system context. We propose to remedy this by generating code with no replication, and show that this generally results in some loss of modularity. We show that optimizing modularity while maintaining maximal reusability and zero replication is an intractable problem (NP-complete). We also show that this problem can be solved using a simple iterative procedure that checks satisfiability of a sequence of propositional formulas. We report on a new prototype implementation and experimental results. The latter demonstrate the practical interest in our methods.",

                    "Traditionally, research in global placement has focused on relatively few simple metrics, such as pure wirelength or routability estimates. However, in the real world today, designs are driven by not-so-simple issues such as timing and crosstalk. The future holds even more difficulties as physical models for devices and interconnects become increasingly complex and unpredictable. Adoption of an iterative methodology, where one incrementally fixes design errors, is a basic approach to tackling these problems. However, developers of placement algorithms have long neglected the need for an tool which can be easily adopted into an incremental design flow.  We propose a novel placement approach called grid morphing, which is specifically tailored for an incremental approach to placement. In particular, our technique focuses on the stability of the placement, which is critical for minimization of perturbation of the final placement under changes applied to the input netlist. We comparethe stability of our approach to existing placement tools, and show through experiments that our approach still delivers good results under traditional placement metrics.",

By addressing this issue, we can enable the use of higher learning rates, reduce the need for careful hyperparameter tuning, and improve convergence rates. This could lead to faster training times and better performance across various applications, ultimately advancing the state of the art in machine learning and enabling more complex models to be trained effectively.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge in reducing internal covariate shift lies in the complex interactions between the parameters of deep networks and the distributions of inputs to each layer. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the dynamic nature of these distributions during training, which can lead to saturation and vanishing gradients. Additionally, the need for careful initialization and tuning of learning rates complicates the training process. Overcoming these technical obstacles requires a robust mechanism that can stabilize the input distributions across layers throughout the training process.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has largely focused on external covariate shift and has not adequately addressed the internal dynamics of deep networks. Existing solutions often overlook the importance of maintaining stable input distributions for sub-networks or layers. Barriers such as the lack of effective normalization techniques and the complexity of deep network architectures have prevented this problem from being solved. Our approach, Batch Normalization, differs by introducing a normalization step that directly addresses internal covariate shift, thereby improving training efficiency and model performance.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves implementing Batch Normalization, which normalizes the inputs to each layer by fixing their means and variances. We will evaluate this approach using standard deep learning datasets, measuring performance through metrics such as training time, convergence rates, and model accuracy. The expected outcomes include accelerated training processes, improved gradient flow, and enhanced model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of Batch Normalization in reducing internal covariate shift."

            "abstract": "Top-down visual attention mechanisms have been used extensively in image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) to enable deeper image understanding through fine-grained analysis and even multiple steps of reasoning. In this work, we propose a combined bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism that enables attention to be calculated at the level of objects and other salient image regions. This is the natural basis for attention to be considered. Within our approach, the bottom-up mechanism (based on Faster R-CNN) proposes image regions, each with an associated feature vector, while the top-down mechanism determines feature weightings. Applying this approach to image captioning, our results on the MSCOCO test server establish a new state-of-the-art for the task, achieving CIDEr / SPICE / BLEU-4 scores of 117.9, 21.5 and 36.9, respectively. Demonstrating the broad applicability of the method, applying the same approach to VQA we obtain first place in the 2017 VQA Challenge.",
            "introduction": " Introduction Problems combining image and language understand- ing such as image captioning [4] and visual question an- swering (VQA) [12] continue to inspire considerable re- search at the boundary of computer vision and natural lan- guage processing. In both these tasks it is often necessary to perform some ﬁne-grained visual processing, or even multiple steps of reasoning to generate high quality out- puts. As a result, visual attention mechanisms have been widely adopted in both image captioning [34, 27, 48, 46] and VQA [11, 28, 45, 47, 51]. These mechanisms improve performance by learning to focus on the regions of the im- age that are salient and are currently based on deep neural network architectures. \u0003Work performed while interning at Microsoft. Figure 1. Typically, attention models operate on CNN features cor- responding to a uniform grid of equally-sized image regions (left). Our approach enables attention to be calculated at the level of ob- jects and other salient image regions (right). In the human visual system, attention can be focused volitionally by top-down signals determined by the cur- rent task (e.g., looking for something), and automatically by bottom-up signals associated with unexpected, novel or salient stimuli [3, 6]. In this paper we adopt similar termi- nology and refer to attention mechanisms driven by non- visual or task-speciﬁc context as ‘top-down’, and purely vi- sual feed-forward attention mechanisms as ‘bottom-up’. Most conventional visual attention mechanisms used in image captioning and VQA are of the top-down variety. Taking as context a representation of a partially-completed caption output, or a question relating to the image, these mechanisms are typically trained to selectively attend to the output of one or more layers of a convolutional neural net (CNN). However, this approach gives little consideration to how the image regions that are subject to attention are deter- mined. As illustrated conceptually in Figure 1, the resulting 1arXiv:1707.07998v3  [cs.CV]  14 Mar 2018input regions correspond to a uniform grid of equally sized and shaped neural receptive ﬁelds – irrespective of the con- tent of the image. To generate more human-like captions and question answers, objects and other salient image re- gions are a much more natural basis for attention [10, 36]. In this paper we propose a combined bottom-up and top- down visual attention mechanism. The bottom-up mech- anism proposes a set of salient image regions, with each region represented by a pooled convolutional feature vec- tor. Practically, we implement bottom-up attention using Faster R-CNN [33], which represents a natural expression of a bottom-up attention mechanism. The top-down mecha- nism uses task-speciﬁc context to predict an attention distri- bution over the image regions. The attended feature vector is then computed as a weighted average of image features over all regions. We evaluate the impact of combining bottom-up and top- down attention on two tasks. We ﬁrst present an image cap- tioning model that takes multiple glimpses of salient im- age regions during caption generation. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the inclusion of bottom-up attention has a signiﬁcant positive beneﬁt for image captioning. Our Related Work A large number of attention-based deep neural networks have been proposed for image captioning and VQA. Typ- ically, these models can be characterized as top-down ap- proaches, with context provided by a representation of a partially-completed caption in the case of image caption- ing [34, 27, 48, 46], or a representation of the question in the case of VQA [11, 28, 45, 47, 51]. In each case",

                    "abstract": "Deep Learning has had a transformative impact on Computer Vision, but for all of the success there is also a significant cost. This is that the models and procedures used are so complex and intertwined that it is often impossible to distinguish the impact of the individual design and engineering choices each model embodies. This ambiguity diverts progress in the field, and leads to a situation where developing a state-of-the-art model is as much an art as a science. As a step towards addressing this problem we present a massive exploration of the effects of the myriad architectural and hyperparameter choices that must be made in generating a state-of-the-art model. The model is of particular interest because it won the 2017 Visual Question Answering Challenge. We provide a detailed analysis of the impact of each choice on model performance, in the hope that it will inform others in developing models, but also that it might set a precedent that will accelerate scientific progress in the field."

On VQA 1.0 open ended challenge, our model achieves 64.6% accuracy on the test-standard set without using additional data, an improvement of 0.4% over state of the art, and on newly released VQA 2.0, our model scores 59.7% on validation set outperforming best previously reported results by 0.5%. The results presented in this paper are especially interesting because very similar models have been tried before but significantly lower performance were reported.

However, the decoder likely requires little to no visual information from the image to predict non-visual words such as the and of. Other words that may seem visual can often be predicted reliably just from the language model e.g., sign after behind a red stop or phone following talking on a cell. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive attention model with a visual sentinel. At each time step, our model decides whether to attend to the image (and if so, to which regions) or to the visual sentinel. The model decides whether to attend to the image and where, in order to extract meaningful information for sequential word generation. We test our method on the COCO image captioning 2015 challenge dataset and Flickr30K. Our approach sets the new state-of-the-art by a significant margin."

In contrast to previous attentionbased approaches that associate image regions only to the RNN state, our method allows a direct association between caption words and image regions. During training these associations are inferred from image-level captions, akin to weakly-supervised object detector training. These associations help to improve captioning by localizing the corresponding regions during testing. We also propose and compare different ways of generating attention areas: CNN activation grids, object proposals, and spatial transformers nets applied in a convolutional fashion. Spatial transformers give the best results. They allow for image specific attention areas, and can be trained jointly with the rest of the network. Our attention mechanism and spatial transformer attention areas together yield state-of-the-art results on the MSCOCO dataset."

In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing image captioning systems using reinforcement learning, and show that by carefully optimizing our systems using the test metrics of the MSCOCO task, significant gains in performance can be realized. Our systems are built using a new optimization approach that we call self-critical sequence training (SCST). SCST is a form of the popular REINFORCE algorithm that, rather than estimating a baseline to normalize the rewards and reduce variance, utilizes the output of its own test-time inference algorithm to normalize the rewards it experiences. Using this approach, estimating the reward signal (as actor-critic methods must do) and estimating normalization (as REINFORCE algorithms typically do) is avoided, while at the same time harmonizing the model with respect to its test-time inference procedure. Empirically we find that directly optimizing the CIDEr metric with SCST and greedy decoding at test-time is highly effective. Our results on the MSCOCO evaluation sever establish a new state-of-the-art on the task, improving the best result in terms of CIDEr from 104.9 to 114.7."

Standard syntactic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR and ROUGE, are also not well correlated. The newer SPICE and CIDEr metrics are better correlated, but have traditionally been hard to optimize for. In this paper, we show how to use a policy gradient (PG) method to directly optimize a linear combination of SPICE and CIDEr (a combination we call SPIDEr): the SPICE score ensures our captions are semantically faithful to the image, while CIDEr score ensures our captions are syntactically fluent. The PG method we propose improves on the prior MIXER approach, by using Monte Carlo rollouts instead of mixing MLE training with PG. We show empirically that our algorithm leads to easier optimization and improved results compared to MIXER. Finally, we show that using our PG method we can optimize any of the metrics, including the proposed SPIDEr metric which results in image captions that are strongly preferred by human raters compared to captions generated by the same model but trained to optimize MLE or the COCO metrics."

Answering general questions about images requires methods capable of Zero-Shot VQA, that is, methods able to answer questions beyond the scope of the training questions. We propose a new evaluation protocol for VQA methods which measures their ability to perform Zero-Shot VQA, and in doing so highlights significant practical deficiencies of current approaches, some of which are masked by the biases in current datasets. We propose and evaluate several strategies for achieving Zero-Shot VQA, including methods based on pretrained word embeddings, object classifiers with semantic embeddings, and test-time retrieval of example images. Our extensive experiments are intended to serve as baselines for Zero-Shot VQA, and they also achieve state-of-the-art performance in the standard VQA evaluation setting."

We hypothesize that these methods are not as expressive as an outer product of the visual and textual vectors. As the outer product is typically infeasible due to its high dimensionality, we instead propose utilizing Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to efficiently and expressively combine multimodal features. We extensively evaluate MCB on the visual question answering and grounding tasks. We consistently show the benefit of MCB over ablations without MCB. For visual question answering, we present an architecture which uses MCB twice, once for predicting attention over spatial features and again to combine the attended representation with the question representation.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention. Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks.

This alignment characterizes the flow of \"abstract meaning\", encoding what is semantically shared by both the visual scene and the text description. Our system also makes another novel modeling contribution by introducing scene-specific contexts that capture higher-level semantic information encoded in an image. The contexts adapt language models for word generation to specific scene types. We benchmark our system and contrast to published results on several popular datasets. We show that using either region-based attention or scene-specific contexts improves systems without those components.

A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork."

This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations."

An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

In this paper we investigate whether this direct approach succeeds due to, or despite, the fact that it avoids the explicit representation of high-level information. We propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering.

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are “doubly deep” in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal “layers”. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

Treisman and Gelade proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items are preattentively grouped, however, attention may be directed to groups rather than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could generate an illusory target. This prediction is confirmed: In search for conjunctions, subjects appear to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning rate shows little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for features, on the other hand, appears to independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target can be camouflaged at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between two adjacent groups, each of which shares one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global configuration."

This limitation severely hinders the use of these models in real world applications dealing with images in the wild. We address this problem using a flexible approach that enables existing deep captioning architectures to take advantage of image taggers at test time, without re-training. Our method uses constrained beam search to force the inclusion of selected tag words in the output, and fixed, pretrained word embeddings to facilitate vocabulary expansion to previously unseen tag words. Using this approach we achieve state of the art results for out-of-domain captioning on MSCOCO (and improved results for in-domain captioning). Perhaps surprisingly, our results significantly outperform approaches that incorporate the same tag predictions into the learning algorithm.

                    "This thesis introduces a number of new techniques motivated by the desire to improve robots’ perception of their environment in RoboCup SPL. These methods include a unified field-feature inverse sensor model, a natural landmark localisation system, a visual odometry module, and a robot detection system that combines vision with sonar sensors. All of these techniques were demonstrated in the 2012 RoboCup competition. Using a variation of ICP, the field-feature sensor model combines multiple simultaneous observations of aliased field-features into a single robot pose observation by: (1) matching observed features to the field map in a hierarchical fashion, and (2) minimising the squared positioning error simultaneously over all observed features. Results indicate that this sensor model is able to localise the robot from a single observation in 42% of field positions where multiple fieldfeatures are visible. However, it is not possible to distinguish between one end of the field and the other using field-features; this capability is provided by a natural landmark localisation system. Using a ‘bag of words’ image representation, the natural landmark localisation system stores up to 40 images of each goal area, and then matches camera frames to these stored images in real time on the Nao to resolve the field-end ambiguity. In a static environment this system is shown to perform flawlessly in repeated kidnap tests. To further improve robot localisation, a fast and unique method for calculating visual heading odometry is also presented. Experiments indicate that this system can reduce the odometric uncertainty of an uncalibrated Nao robot by 73%. The visual odometry module is also able to detect collisions with unseen objects, while remaining robust to the presence of moving objects in the environment. Both the visual odometry module and the natural landmark localisation system are based on modified 1D SURF image features extracted from pixels on the robot’s horizon. Consistent with the original SURF algorithm, the extracted features are robust to lighting changes, scale changes, and small changes in viewing angle or to the scene itself, while achieving a speed up of several orders of magnitude over SURF. This makes 1D SURF features suitable for visual navigation of resource constrained mobile robots. Finally, a combined vision and sonar robot detection system is presented that uses a novel sonar hardware control scheme to introduce a third sonar detection sector in front of the robot. Evidence suggests that during a penalty shoot-out, this system enables the striker to localise a stationary goalie to within 28 mm to 60 mm before shooting. This capability also enabled rUNSWift to develop coordinated role-switching behaviours that remain operational during total wireless failures.",

                    "Computer graphics researchers recently have turned to image-based rendering to achieve the goal of photorealistic graphics. Instead of constructing a scene with millions of polygons, the scene is represented by a collection of photographs along with a greatly simplified geometric model. This simple representation allows traditional light transport simulations to be replaced with basic image-processing routines that combine multiple images together to produce never-before-seen images from new vantage points. This thesis presents a new image-based rendering algorithm called unstructured lumigraph rendering (ULR). ULR is an image-based rendering algorithm that is specifically designed to work with unstructured (i.e., irregularly arranged) collections of images. The algorithm is unique in that it is capable of using any amount of geometric or image information that is available about a scene. Specifically, the research in this thesis makes the following contributions: An enumeration of image-based rendering properties that an ideal algorithm should attempt to satisfy. An algorithm that satisfies these properties should work as well as possible with any configuration of input images or geometric knowledge. An optimal formulation of the basic image-based rendering problem, the solution to which is designed to satisfy the aforementioned properties. The unstructured lumigraph rendering algorithm, which is an efficient approximation to the optimal image-based rendering solution.

In particular, it allows for lumigraph-style rendering from a set of input cameras in arbitrary configurations (i.e., not restricted to a plane or to any specific manifold). In the case of regular and planar input camera positions, our algorithm reduces to a typical lumigraph approach. When presented with fewer cameras and good approximate geometry, our algorithm behaves like view-dependent texture mapping. The algorithm achieves this flexibility because it is designed to meet a set of specific goals that we describe. We demonstrate this flexibility with a variety of examples.",

We render these visual hulls with a view-dependent texturing strategy, which takes into account visibility information that is computed during the creation of the visual hull. We demonstrate these algorithms in a system that asynchronously renders dynamically created visual hulls in real-time. Our system outperforms similar systems of comparable computational power.",

We approach this problem from an image-based rendering (IBR) standpoint. Given an unstabilized video sequence, the task is to synthesize a new sequence as seen from a stabilized camera trajectory. This task is relatively straightforward if one has a Euclidean reconstruction of the unstabilized camera trajectory and a suitable IBR algorithm. However, it is often not feasible to obtain a Euclidean reconstruction from an arbitrary video sequence. In light of this problem, we describe IBR techniques for non-metric reconstructions, which are often much easier to obtain since they do not require camera calibration. These rendering techniques are well suited to the video stabilization problem. The key idea behind our techniques is that all measurements are specified in the image space, rather than in the non-metric space.",

We then introduce the image-based visual hull, an efficient representation of an object''s visual hull. We demonstrate two desirable properties of the image-based visual hull. First, it can be computed efficiently (i.e., in real-time) from multiple silhouette images. Second, it can be quickly rendered from novel viewpoints.

Most current methods demand training questions that illustrate every possible concept, and will therefore never achieve this capability, since the volume of required training data would be prohibitive. Answering general questions about images requires methods capable of Zero-Shot VQA, that is, methods able to answer questions beyond the scope of the training questions. We propose a new evaluation protocol for VQA methods which measures their ability to perform Zero-Shot VQA, and in doing so highlights significant practical deficiencies of current approaches, some of which are masked by the biases in current datasets. We propose and evaluate several strategies for achieving Zero-Shot VQA, including methods based on pretrained word embeddings, object classifiers with semantic embeddings, and test-time retrieval of example images. Our extensive experiments are intended to serve as baselines for Zero-Shot VQA, and they also achieve state-of-the-art performance in the standard VQA evaluation setting.",
                    "This paper proposes to improve visual question answering (VQA) with structured representations of both scene contents and questions. A key challenge in VQA is to require joint reasoning over the visual and text domains. The predominant CNN/LSTM-based approach to VQA is limited by monolithic vector representations that largely ignore structure in the scene and in the question. CNN feature vectors cannot effectively capture situations as simple as multiple object instances, and LSTMs process questions as series of words, which do not reflect the true complexity of language structure. We instead propose to build graphs over the scene objects and over the question words, and we describe a deep neural network that exploits the structure in these representations. We show that this approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy from 71.2% to 74.4% in accuracy on the abstract scenes multiple-choice benchmark, and from 34.7% to 39.1% in accuracy over pairs of balanced scenes, i.e. images with fine-grained differences and opposite yes/no answers to a same question.",
                    "This paper addresses the segmentation of videos with arbitrary motion, including dynamic textures, using novel motion features and a supervised learning approach. Dynamic textures are commonplace in natural scenes, and exhibit complex patterns of appearance and motion (e.g. water, smoke, swaying foliage). These are difficult for existing segmentation algorithms, often violate the brightness constancy assumption needed for optical flow, and have complex segment characteristics beyond uniform appearance or motion. Our solution uses custom spatiotemporal filters that capture texture and motion cues, along with a novel metric-learning framework that optimizes this representation for specific objects and scenes. This is used within a hierarchical, graph-based segmentation setting, yielding state-of-the-art results for dynamic texture segmentation. We also demonstrate the applicability of our approach to general object and motion segmentation, showing significant improvements over unsupervised segmentation and results comparable to the best task specific approaches.",

                    "We propose a novel method for performing fine-grained recognition of human hand grasp types using a single monocular image to allow computational systems to better understand human hand use. In particular, we focus on recognizing challenging grasp categories which differ only by subtle variations in finger configurations. While much of the prior work on understanding human hand grasps has been based on manual detection of grasps in video, this is the first work to automate the analysis process for fine-grained grasp classification. Instead of attempting to utilize a parametric model of the hand, we propose a hand parsing framework which leverages a data-driven learning to generate a pixel-wise segmentation of a hand into finger and palm regions. The proposed approach makes use of appearance-based cues such as finger texture and hand shape to accurately determine hand parts. We then build on the hand parsing result to compute high-level grasp features to learn a supervised fine-grained grasp classifier. To validate our approach, we introduce a grasp dataset recorded with a wearable camera, where the hand and its parts have been manually segmented with pixel-wise accuracy. Our results show that our proposed automatic hand parsing technique can improve grasp classification accuracy by over 30 percentage points over a state-of-the-art grasp recognition technique.",
                    "In this paper, we tackle the problem of face classification and verification. We present a novel face representation method based on a Bayesian network. The model captures dependencies between 2D salient facial regions and the full 3D geometrical model of the face, which makes it robust to pose variations, and useable in unconstrained environments. We present experiments on the challenging databases FERET and LFW, which show a significant advantage over state-of-the-art methods.",
                    "In video segmentation, disambiguating appearance cues by grouping similar motions or dynamics is potentially powerful, though non-trivial. Dynamic changes of appearance can occur from rigid or non-rigid motion, as well as complex dynamic textures. While the former are easily captured by optical flow, phenomena such as a dissipating cloud of smoke, or flickering reflections on water, do not satisfy the assumption of brightness constancy, or cannot be modelled with rigid displacements in the image. To tackle this problem, we propose a robust representation of image dynamics as histograms of motion energy (HoME) obtained from convolutions of the video with spatiotemporal filters. They capture a wide range of dynamics and handle problems previously studied separately (motion and dynamic texture segmentation). They thus offer a potential solution for a new class of problems that contain these effects in the same scene. Our representation of image dynamics is integrated in a graph-based segmentation framework and combined with colour histograms to represent the appearance of regions. In the case of translating and occluding segments, the proposed features additionally serve to characterize the motion of the boundary between pairs of segments, to identify the occluder and inferring a local depth ordering. The resulting segmentation method is completely modelfree and unsupervised, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the SynthDB dataset for dynamic texture segmentation, on the MIT dataset for motion segmentation, and reasonable performance on the CMU dataset for occlusion boundaries.",
                    "Motion in videos is a powerful cue to aid in scene understanding, by identifying the boundaries and the depth ordering of occluding objects. It can help to separate objects using their intrinsic motion, or parallax-induced motion at different depths. Most existing work rely on the computation of the optical flow, grouped into similar regions according to a parametric (e.g. affine) motion model. Two limitations ensue from this approach. First, the computation of the optical flow, despite recent advances, remains computationally expensive and relies on assumptions (e.g. brightness constancy or rigidly moving objects) that may not hold true. Secondly, parametric motions may similarly be limited to simple scenes with translating objects. More complex cases include deformable objects, repetitive motions, etc. In this work, we consider the use of motion energies, directly obtained from convolutions of the video with spatiotemporal filters, as an alternative image feature to optical flow for motion segmentation. We represent the motion of a region of the video with distributions of such motion energies, thereby alleviating the limitations of parametric motion models. The combination of motion and appearance cues to improve boundary detection has mostly been addressed through supervised training [4]. This has some disadvantages related to the availability of suitable training data and to possible annotation bias in what actually constitutes relevant boundaries. Instead, we are interested in establishing a learning-free baseline, and we rather hypothesize that a segmentation framework is a suitable paradigm for grouping motions, similarly as it is for grouping static color and textures cues. Most work on video segmentation extends image segmentation techniques, and the joint grouping of appearance and motion features in complex scenes is still an open problem. [3], for example, briefly mentions the use of histograms of optical flow, though the improvement in performance was not rigorously evaluated. Our contributions consist in (i) the integration of lowlevel, filter-based motion features into an existing seg-",
                    "Vision is a crucial capability for enabling robots to perceive and interact with their environment, e.g. manipulating or grasping objects. A current trend is bringing closer the aspects of interaction and perception, on the one hand by integrating visual information directly in the control process, and on the other hand, using interaction itself to help perception, allowing robots to explore their environment. In the context of manipulation, physical parts of the robot are then likely to appear in the observations, and an important capability emerges as the recognition of those parts, in order to separate the observations of the scene from those of the robot itself. Identifying the robot’s own body parts in input images has been used before in different ways, helping obstacle avoidance or control directly (through visual servoing [1]). However, this is usually performed via indirect methods, tracking fiducial markers purposely attached to the robot [2], which imposes undesirable (e.g. visibility) constraints. Some recent work adresses the pose estimation of a robot manipulator directly [3], [4], but these methods focus on tracking the manipulator between consecutive frames, whereas the initial recognition is considered as the harder part. We propose a method for markerless, monocular recognition and pose estimation of an articulated robot arm, dealing with single images without initialization, allowing its use with unknown hand-eye calibration, imprecise kinematics or missing position feedback.",
                    "We present a general method for tackling the related problems of pose estimation of known object instances and object categories. By representing the training images as a probability distribution over the joint appearance/pose space, the method is naturally suitable for modeling the appearance of a single instance of an object, or of diverse instances of the same category. The training data is weighted and forms a generative model, the weights being based on the informative power of each image feature for specific poses. Pose inference is performed through probabilistic voting in pose space, which is intrinsically robust to clutter and occlusions, and which we render tractable by treating separately the least interdependent dimensions. The scalability of category-level models is ensured during training by clustering the available image features in the joint appearance/pose space. Finally, we show how to first efficiently use a category-model, then possibly recognize a particular trained instance to refine the pose estimate using the corresponding instance-specific model. Our implementation uses edge points as image features, and was tested on several existing datasets. We obtain results on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods, on both instance- and category-level problems, including for generalization to unseen instances.",

Our central contribution is the modeling of the appearance of objects as probabilistic distributions of visual characteristics, learned from training examples. We present techniques to use such models to identify and localize objects in images of cluttered scenes, and determine their actual position and orientation in space.",
                    "This paper addresses the problem of full pose estimation of objects in 2D images, using registered 2D examples as training data. We present a general formulation of the problem, which departs from traditional approaches by not focusing on one specific type of image features. The proposed algorithm avoids relying on specific model-to-scene correspondences, allowing using similar-looking and generally unmatchable features. We effectively demonstrate this capability by applying the method to edge segments. Our algorithm uses successive histogram-based and probabilistic evaluations, which ultimately recover a complete description of the probability distribution of the pose of the object, in the 6 degree-of-freedom 3D pose space, thereby accounting for the inherent ambiguities in the 2D input data. Furthermore, we propose, in a rigorous framework, an efficient procedure for fusing multiple sources of evidence, such as multiple registered 2D views of the same scene. The proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic and real test images. It shows promising results under challenging conditions, including occlusions and heavy clutter, while being capable of handling objects with little texture and detail.",
                    "This paper introduces a novel method for feature-based 3D reconstruction using multiple calibrated 2D views. We use a probabilistic formulation of the problem in the 3D, reconstructed space that allows using features that cannot be matched one-to-one, or which cannot be precisely located, such as points along edges. The reconstructed scene, modelled as a probability distribution in the 3D space, is defined as the intersection of all reconstructions compatible with each available view. We introduce a method based on importance sampling to retrieve individual samples from that distribution, as well as an iterative method to identify contiguous regions of high density. This allows the reconstruction of continuous 3D curves compatible with all the given input views, without establishing specific correspondences and without relying on connectivity in the input images, while accounting for uncertainty in the input observations, due e.g.\\ to noisy images and poorly calibrated cameras. The technical formulation is attractive in its flexibility and genericity. The implemented system, evaluated on several very different publicly-available datasets, shows results competitive with existing methods, effectively dealing with arbitrary numbers of views, wide baselines and imprecise camera calibrations.",

However, most previous works focused on low level descriptors of shapes and sketches. In this paper, we try to step forward and propose to leverage shape words descriptor for sketch-based image retrieval. First, the shape words are defined and an efficient algorithm is designed for shape words extraction. Then we generalize the classic Chamfer Matching algorithm to address the shape words matching problem. Finally, a novel inverted index structure is proposed to make shape words representation scalable to large scale image databases. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy but requires much less memory, e.g., less than 3% of memory storage of MindFinder. Due to its competitive accuracy and low memory cost, our method can scale up to much larger database.",
                    "Near-duplicate image discovery is the task of detecting all clusters of images which duplicate at a significant region. Previous work generally take divide and conquer approaches composed of two steps: generating cluster seeds using min-hashing, and growing the seeds by searching the entire image space with the seeds as queries. Since the computational complexity of the seed growing step is generally O (NL) where N and L are the number of images and seeds respectively, existing work can hardly be scaled up to a billion-scale dataset because L is typically millions. In this paper, we study a feasible solution of near-duplicate image discovery on one billion images, which is easily implemented on MapReduce framework. The major contribution of this work is to introduce the seed growing step designed to efficiently reduce the number of false positives among cluster seeds with O (cNL) time complexity, where c is small enough for a billion-scale dataset. The basis component of the seed growing step is a bottom-k min-hash, which generates different signatures in a sketch to remove all candidate images that share only one common visual word with a cluster seed. Our evaluations suggest that the proposed method can discover near-duplicate clusters with high precision and recall, and represent some interesting properties of our 1 billion dataset.",

IdeaPanel needs only about 240MB memory to index 1.3M images (less than 3% of previous MindFinder system). Due to its high accuracy and low memory cost, IdealPanel can scale up to much larger database and thus has larger potential to return the most desired images for users.",

It has been shown that the results of fatigue life calculated by hybrid method are well correlated with the experiment.",
                    "In this paper we address the problem of visual instance mining, which is to automatically discover frequently appearing visual instances from a large collection of images. We propose a scalable mining method by leveraging the graph structure with images as vertices. Different from most existing work that focused on either instance-level similarities or image-level context properties, our graph captures both information. The instance-level information is integrated during the construction of a weighted and undirected instance graph based on the similarity between augmented local features, while the image-level context is explored with a greedy breadth-first search algorithm to discover clusters of visual instances from the graph. This method is capable of mining challenging small visual instances with diverse variations. We evaluated our method on two fully annotated datasets and outperformed the state of the arts on both datasets with higher recalls. We also applied our method on a one-million Flickr dataset and proved its scalability.",
                    "In this paper, we study the problem of discovering visual patterns and partial-duplicate images, which is fundamental to visual concept representation and image parsing, but very challenging when the database is extremely large, such as billions of images indexed by a commercial search engine. Although extensive research with sophisticated algorithms has been conducted for either partial-duplicate clustering or visual pattern discovery, most of them can not be easily extended to this scale, since both are clustering problems in nature and require pairwise comparisons. To tackle this computational challenge, we introduce a novel and highly parallelizable framework to discover partial-duplicate images and visual patterns in a unified way in distributed computing systems. We emphasize the nested property of local features, and propose the generalized nested feature (GNF) as a mid-level representation for regions and local patterns. Initial coarse clusters are then discovered by GNFs, upon which n-gram GNF is defined to represent co-occurrent visual patterns. After that, efficient merging and refining algorithms are used to get the partial-duplicate clusters, and logical combinations of probabilistic GNF models are leveraged to represent the visual patterns of partially duplicate images. Extensive experiments show the parallelizable property and effectiveness of the algorithms on both partial-duplicate clustering and visual pattern discovery. With 2000 machines, it costs about eight and 400 minutes to process one million and 40 million images respectively, which is quite efficient compared to previous methods.",
                    "Images are often used to convey many different concepts or illustrate many different stories. We propose an algorithm to mine multiple diverse, relevant, and interesting text snippets for images on the web. Our algorithm scales to all images on the web. For each image, all webpages that contain it are considered. The top-K text snippet selection problem is posed as combinatorial subset selection with the goal of choosing an optimal set of snippets that maximizes a combination of relevancy, interestingness, and diversity. The relevancy and interestingness are scored by machine learned models. Our algorithm is run at scale on the entire image index of a major search engine resulting in the construction of a database of images with their corresponding text snippets. We validate the quality of the database through a large-scale comparative study. We showcase the utility of the database through two web-scale applications: (a) augmentation of images on the web as webpages are browsed and (b)~an image browsing experience (similar in spirit to web browsing) that is enabled by interconnecting semantically related images (which may not be visually related) through shared concepts in their corresponding text snippets.",
                    "Objective To explore the risk factors and treatment outcomes of contralateral new upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) after nephroureterectomy in a large single-center cohort of UTUC patients. Methods A retrospective analysis of the clinicopathological data of 509 consecutive patients treated by nephroureterectomy from 2000 to 2010 at a high-volume center in China was conducted. Results Thirty-five patients (6.9%) were found to develop contralateral UTUC. Gross hematuria was a common symptom, and aristolochic acid (AA) containing Chinese herbs were identified as an underlying cause. In multivariate analysis, renal transplant recipients (HR =16.507) and preoperative renal insufficiency (HR =2.523) were independent risk factors. No correlation was found in the clinical and pathological characteristics of primary and subsequent contralateral UTUC. A second round of nephroureterectomy should be performed on renal transplant patients, whereas patients who are older, exhibit relatively better renal function, and have tumors that are single, located in the ureter and small size could be treated with nephron-sparing surgery. No survival difference was detected between the two treatment groups, and developing contralateral UTUC was not associated with worse survival. Conclusions Contralateral UTUC is comparatively rare, and gross hematuria is a common symptom. Renal transplant history and renal insufficiency are independent risk factors, and prophylactic contralateral nephroureterectomy is considered for uremic UTUC patients with proper renal replacement treatment or renal transplant recipients. These features are likely related to the mechanisms of multifocality of UTUC, and the potential correlation with AA remains to be elucidated. Tumor characteristics and renal function are informative for the decisions concerning surgical options for contralateral UTUC.",
                    "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between normal cognitive function and dementia among aging individuals. This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of MCI and explore the possible risk factors including gender disparities among community-dwelling older individuals. The study was conducted in Xi’an, China. This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 815 individuals, 60 years and older were selected by stratified random cluster sampling. Cognitive function was measured using the mini-mental status examination (MMSE), the Chinese version of the Dementia Rating Scales (CDRS) was used to apply the diagnostic of non-dementia, and activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) systems were used to functional status. The association between sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, history of chronic diseases and MCI were evaluated separately for men and women using the Pearson χ2- test and binary logistic regression. Of the 815 community-dwelling individuals, 145 were found to have MCI. Overall, the prevalence of MCI was 18.5%, with a prevalence of 19.6% in women (105/535), and 15.3% (40/261) in men. The results of the binary logistical regression analysis indicated that age and history of stroke were associated with MCI in men. For women, the risk factors were lower level of educational and lack of religious attendance. Results suggested that the factors capable of influencing MCI differed profoundly between older men and older women. For this reason, different preventative measures should be adopted to delay or reverse cognitive impairment among community-dwelling older men and women."

Improved performance in image captioning and VQA can enhance applications in accessibility, content creation, and human-computer interaction. This research could pave the way for more sophisticated AI systems that better understand visual contexts and generate relevant textual descriptions, ultimately influencing future research directions in multimodal learning and AI interpretability.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge lies in the complexity of integrating two distinct attention mechanisms—bottom-up and top-down—while ensuring that the model can effectively learn to focus on salient image regions relevant to the task at hand. Naive approaches may fail because they often rely on uniform grids of image regions, which do not account for the varying importance of different objects or features in an image. Additionally, the technical obstacles include the need for robust feature extraction from images and the effective modeling of task-specific context, which requires sophisticated neural network architectures and training strategies.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on top-down attention mechanisms, which limit the model's ability to dynamically identify and prioritize salient image regions. Existing solutions often overlook the importance of bottom-up signals that can provide critical context for attention. Barriers such as the lack of effective methods for integrating these two types of attention and the computational complexity involved have hindered progress. Our approach differs by explicitly combining bottom-up attention, which identifies salient regions using Faster R-CNN, with top-down attention driven by task-specific context, thereby addressing these limitations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves implementing a combined bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism. We will utilize the Faster R-CNN model to extract salient image regions, represented by pooled convolutional feature vectors. The top-down mechanism will leverage task-specific context to predict an attention distribution over these regions. We will evaluate our approach on image captioning and visual question answering tasks, using metrics such as BLEU scores for captioning and accuracy for VQA.

            "introduction": " Introduction Since their introduction by (LeCun et al., 1989) in the early 1990's, Convolutional Networks (convnets) have demonstrated excellent performance at tasks such as hand-written digit classi\fcation and face detec- tion. In the last year, several papers have shown that they can also deliver outstanding performance on more challenging visual classi\fcation tasks. (Ciresan et al., 2012) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on NORB and CIFAR-10 datasets. Most notably, (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) show record beating perfor- mance on the ImageNet 2012 classi\fcation benchmark, with their convnet model achieving an error rate of 16.4%, compared to the 2nd place result of 26.1%. Several factors are responsible for this renewed inter-est in convnet models: (i) the availability of much larger training sets, with millions of labeled exam- ples; (ii) powerful GPU implementations, making the training of very large models practical and (iii) bet- ter model regularization strategies, such as Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012). Despite this encouraging progress, there is still lit- tle insight into the internal operation and behavior of these complex models, or how they achieve such good performance. From a scienti\fc standpoint, this is deeply unsatisfactory. Without clear understanding of how and why they work, the development of better models is reduced to trial-and-error. In this paper we introduce a visualization technique that reveals the in- put stimuli that excite individual feature maps at any layer in the model. It also allows us to observe the evolution of features during training and to diagnose potential problems with the model. The visualization technique we propose uses a multi-layered Deconvo- lutional Network (deconvnet), as proposed by (Zeiler et al., 2011), to project the feature activations back to the input pixel space. We also perform a sensitivity analysis of the classi\fer output by occluding portions of the input image, revealing which parts of the scene are important for classi\fcation. Using these tools, we start with the architecture of (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and explore di\u000berent archi- tectures, discovering ones that outperform their methods ([A]= (Sande et al., 2012) and [B] = (Yan et al., 2012)). 5.3. Feature Analysis We explore how discriminative the features in each layer of our Imagenet-pretrained model are. We do this by varying the number of layers retained from the Ima- geNet model and place either a linear SVM or softmax classi\fer on top. Table 7 shows Related Work Visualizing features to gain intuition about the net- work is common practice, but mostly limited to the 1st layer where projections to pixel space are possible. In higher layers this is not the case, and there are limited experiments on a pedestrian dataset (Dalal & Triggs, 2005). We also try a second strategy of training a model from scratch, i.e. resetting layers 1-7 to random values and train them, as well as the softmax, on the training images of the dataset. One complication is that some of the Caltech datasets have some images that are also in the ImageNet train- ing data. Using normalized correlation, we identi\fed these few \\overlap\" images2and removed them from our Imagenet training set and then retrained our Ima- genet models, so avoiding the possibility of train/test contamination. Caltech-101: We follow the procedure of (Fei-fei et al., 2006) and randomly select 15 or 30 images per class for training and test on up to 50 images per class reporting the average of the per-class accuracies in Ta- 2For Caltech-101, we found 44 images in common (out of 9,144 total images), with a maximum overlap of 10 for any given",

The success of CNNs is attributed to their ability to learn rich mid-level image representations as opposed to hand-designed low-level features used in other image classification methods. Learning CNNs, however, amounts to estimating millions of parameters and requires a very large number of annotated image samples. This property currently prevents application of CNNs to problems with limited training data. In this work we show how image representations learned with CNNs on large-scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks with limited amount of training data. We design a method to reuse layers trained on the ImageNet dataset to compute mid-level image representation for images in the PASCAL VOC dataset. We show that despite differences in image statistics and tasks in the two datasets, the transferred representation leads to significantly improved results for object and action classification, outperforming the current state of the art on Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets. We also show promising results for object and action localization."

We consider two visualisation techniques, based on computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image.

The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets. Finally, we establish the connection between the gradient-based ConvNet visualisation methods and deconvolutional networks [Zeiler et al., 2013]."

Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features.

We propose tiled convolution neural networks (Tiled CNNs), which use a regular \"tiled\" pattern of tied weights that does not require that adjacent hidden units share identical weights, but instead requires only that hidden units k steps away from each other to have tied weights. By pooling over neighboring units, this architecture is able to learn complex invariances (such as scale and rotational invariance) beyond translational invariance. Further, it also enjoys much of CNNs' advantage of having a relatively small number of learned parameters (such as ease of learning and greater scalability). We provide an efficient learning algorithm for Tiled CNNs based on Topographic ICA, and show that learning complex invariant features allows us to achieve highly competitive results for both the NORB and CIFAR-10 datasets."

We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (≫ 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

Despite its popularity, these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n2 ~ n3) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

The resulting characterization is in some aspects similar to that given by experimental studies of cortical cells, making it particularly suitable for application to second-order approximations and theoretical models of physiological receptive fields. We first discuss two ways of analyzing a quadratic form by visualizing the coefficients of its quadratic and linear term directly and by considering the eigenvectors of its quadratic term. We then present an algorithm to compute the optimal excitatory and inhibitory stimulithose that maximize and minimize the considered quadratic form, respectively, given a fixed energy constraint. The analysis of the optimal stimuli is completed by considering their invariances, which are the transformations to which the quadratic form is most insensitive, and by introducing a test to determine which of these are statistically significant. Next we propose a way to measure the relative contribution of the quadratic and linear term to the total output of the quadratic form. Furthermore, we derive simpler versions of the above techniques in the special case of a quadratic form without linear term. In the final part of the letter, we show that for each quadratic form, it is possible to build an equivalent two-layer neural network, which is compatible with (but more general than) related networks used in some recent articles and with the energy model of complex cells. We show that the neural network is unique only up to an arbitrary orthogonal transformation of the excitatory and inhibitory subunits in the first layer."

The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods.

Naive approaches to understanding these models often fail because they do not account for the hierarchical nature of feature extraction and the non-linear transformations that occur at each layer. Additionally, the lack of direct interpretability of higher-layer features complicates the analysis. Technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated visualization techniques that can accurately project feature activations back to the input space and the difficulty in isolating the contributions of individual features to the model's output.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on visualizing features at the first layer, where projections to pixel space are straightforward, while higher layers remain largely unexplored due to the complexity of their representations. Existing solutions have been limited by the lack of effective tools for analyzing feature maps and understanding their contributions to classification tasks. Barriers such as the absence of comprehensive sensitivity analysis methods and the challenge of training models from scratch without contamination from overlapping datasets have hindered progress. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing a multi-layered Deconvolutional Network (deconvnet) for detailed visualization and sensitivity analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of feature evolution during training.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves using a multi-layered Deconvolutional Network (deconvnet) to visualize feature activations at various layers of a pretrained convnet model.

We present a multi-task learning architecture with deep bi-directional RNNs, where different tasks supervision can happen at different layers. We present experiments in syntactic chunking and CCG supertagging, coupled with the additional task of POS-tagging. We show that it is consistently better to have POS supervision at the innermost rather than the outermost layer. We argue that this is because “lowlevel” tasks are better kept at the lower layers, enabling the higher-level tasks to make use of the shared representation of the lower-level tasks. Finally, we also show how this architecture can be used for domain adaptation."

To date, most of its applications focused on only one task and not much work explored this framework for multiple tasks. This paper examines three multi-task learning (MTL) settings for sequence to sequence models: (a) the oneto-many setting - where the encoder is shared between several tasks such as machine translation and syntactic parsing, (b) the many-to-one setting - useful when only the decoder can be shared, as in the case of translation and image caption generation, and (c) the many-to-many setting - where multiple encoders and decoders are shared, which is the case with unsupervised objectives and translation. Our results show that training on a small amount of parsing and image caption data can improve the translation quality between English and German by up to 1.5 BLEU points over strong single-task baselines on the WMT benchmarks. Furthermore, we have established a new state-of-the-art result in constituent parsing with 93.0 F1. Lastly, we reveal interesting properties of the two unsupervised learning objectives, autoencoder and skip-thought, in the MTL context: autoencoder helps less in terms of perplexities but more on BLEU scores compared to skip-thought."

In practice, however, the syntactic structure is computed by automatic parsers which are far-from-perfect and not tuned to the specifics of the task. Current recursive neural network (RNN) approaches for computing sentence meaning therefore run into a number of practical difficulties, including the need to carefully select a parser appropriate for the task, deciding how and to what extent syntactic context modifies the semantic composition function, as well as on how to transform parse trees to conform to the branching settings (typically, binary branching) of the RNN. This paper introduces a new model, the Forest Convolutional Network, that avoids all of these challenges, by taking a parse forest as input, rather than a single tree, and by allowing arbitrary branching factors.

However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning."

We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin.

Finally, we apply a new method for training neural translation models with very large vocabularies, and show that this vocabulary expansion algorithm results in minimal degradation of embedding quality. Our embedding spaces can be queried in an online demo and downloaded from our web page.

We show that using a sparse Shifted Positive PMI word-context matrix to represent words improves results on two word similarity tasks and one of two analogy tasks. When dense low-dimensional vectors are preferred, exact factorization with SVD can achieve solutions that are at least as good as SGNS's solutions for word similarity tasks.

We apply our model, qanta, to a dataset of questions from a trivia competition called quiz bowl. Unlike previous rnn models, qanta learns word and phrase-level representations that combine across sentences to reason about entities.

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance."

In this paper, we give a general characterization of oracles that are nondeterministic and complete, present a method for deriving such oracles for transition systems that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these oracles are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative and nonoptimal paths during training — in contrast to oracles that statically assume a unique optimal path.

It is unclear, however, what utility nonlinearity offers in conventional featurebased models. In this study, we show the close connection between CRF and “sequence model” neural nets, and present an empirical investigation to compare their performance on two sequence labeling tasks ‐ Named Entity Recognition and Syntactic Chunking. Our results suggest that non-linear models are highly effective in low-dimensional distributional spaces. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that a nonlinear architecture offers no benefits in a high-dimensional discrete feature space."

Instead, we introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG), which combines PCFGs with a syntactically untied recursive neural network that learns syntactico-semantic, compositional vector representations. The CVG improves the PCFG of the Stanford Parser by 3.8% to obtain an F1 score of 90.4%. It is fast to train and implemented approximately as an efficient reranker it is about 20% faster than the current Stanford factored parser. The CVG learns a soft notion of head words and improves performance on the types of ambiguities that require semantic information such as PP attachments."

In a comprehensive evaluation of 4 language pairs (English to German, French, Russian, Spanish), we found that neural language models are indeed viable tools for data selection: while the improvements are varied (i.e. 0.1 to 1.7 gains in BLEU), they are fast to train on small in-domain data and can sometimes substantially outperform conventional n-grams."

Based on this observation, we suggest an improved method of recovering relational similarities, improving the state-of-the-art results on two recent word-analogy datasets.

The constraints are incorporated into the arc-eager transition system as a set of preconditions for each transition and preserve the linear time complexity of the parser.",

The proposal is centered around the proposition structure of the text, and includes also implicit propositions which can be inferred from the syntax but are not transparent in parse trees, such as copular relations introduced by appositive constructions. Other benefits over dependency-trees are explicit marking of logical relations between propositions, explicit marking of multiword predicate such as light-verbs, and a consistent representation for syntacticallydifferent but semantically-similar structures. The representation is meant to serve as a useful input layer for semanticoriented applications, as well as to provide a better starting point for further levels of semantic analysis such as semantic-rolelabeling and semantic-parsing.",

We find that another embedding method, NCE, is implicitly factorizing a similar matrix, where each cell is the (shifted) log conditional probability of a word given its context. We show that using a sparse Shifted Positive PMI word-context matrix to represent words improves results on two word similarity tasks and one of two analogy tasks. When dense low-dimensional vectors are preferred, exact factorization with SVD can achieve solutions that are at least as good as SGNS's solutions for word similarity tasks. On analogy questions SGNS remains superior to SVD. We conjecture that this stems from the weighted nature of SGNS's factorization.",

The system is based on the PCFG-LA parsing method of Petrov et al. 2006, which is extended in various ways in order to accommodate the specificities of Hebrew as a morphologically rich language with a small treebank. We show that parsing performance can be enhanced by utilizing a language resource external to the treebank, specifically, a lexicon-based morphological analyzer. We present a computational model of interfacing the external lexicon and a treebank-based parser, also in the common case where the lexicon and the treebank follow different annotation schemes. We show that Hebrew word-segmentation and constituency-parsing can be performed jointly using CKY lattice parsing. Performing the tasks jointly is effective, and substantially outperforms a pipeline-based model. We suggest modeling grammatical agreement in a constituency-based parser as a filter mechanism that is orthogonal to the grammar, and present a concrete implementation of the method. Although the constituency parser does not make many agreement mistakes to begin with, the filter mechanism is effective in fixing the agreement mistakes that the parser does make.These contributions extend outside of the scope of Hebrew processing, and are of general applicability to the NLP community. Hebrew is a specific case of a morphologically rich language, and ideas presented in this work are useful also for processing other languages, including English. The lattice-based parsing methodology is useful in any case where the input is uncertain. Extending the lexical coverage of a treebank-derived parser using an external lexicon is relevant for any language with a small treebank.",

                    "Greedy transition-based parsers are very fast but tend to suffer from error propagation. This problem is aggravated by the fact that they are normally trained using oracles that are deterministic and incomplete in the sense that they assume a unique canonical path through the transition system and are only valid as long as the parser does not stray from this path. In this paper, we give a general characterization of oracles that are nondeterministic and complete, present a method for deriving such oracles for transition systems that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these oracles are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative and nonoptimal paths during training — in contrast to oracles that statically assume a unique optimal path. Experimental evaluation on a wide range of data sets clearly shows that using dynamic oracles to train greedy parsers gives substantial improvements in accuracy. Moreover, this improvement comes at no cost in terms of efficiency, unlike other techniques like beam search.",

We focus on dependency-parsing and present an ensemble method which is capable of assigning parents to 84% of the text tokens while being over 96% accurate on these tokens. We use the precision-biased parsing task to solve the related high-quality parse-selection task: finding a subset of high-quality (accurate) trees in a large collection of parsed text. We present a method for choosing over a third of the input trees while keeping unlabeled dependency parsing accuracy of 97% on these trees. We also present a method which is not based on an ensemble but rather on directly predicting the risk associated with individual parser decisions. In addition to its efficiency, this method demonstrates that a parsing system can provide reasonable estimates of confidence in its predictions without relying on ensembles or aggregate corpus counts.",
                    "When porting parsers to a new domain, many of the errors are related to wrong attachment of out-of-vocabulary words. Since there is no available annotated data to learn the attachment preferences of the target domain words, we attack this problem using a model of selectional preferences based on domain-specific word classes. Our method uses Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDA) to learn a domain-specific Selectional Preference model in the target domain using un-annotated data. The model provides features that model the affinities among pairs of words in the domain. To incorporate these new features in the parsing model, we adopt the co-training approach and retrain the parser with the selectional preferences features. We apply this method for adapting Easy First, a fast non-directional parser trained on WSJ, to the biomedical domain (Genia Treebank). The Selectional Preference features reduce error by 4.5% over the co-training baseline.",

We present an improved oracle for the arc-eager transition system, which provides a set of optimal transitions for every valid parser configuration, including configurations from which the gold tree is not reachable. In such cases, the oracle provides transitions that will lead to the best reachable tree from the given configuration. The oracle is efficient to implement and provably correct. We use the oracle to train a deterministic left-to-right dependency parser that is less sensitive to error propagation, using an online training procedure that also explores parser configurations resulting from non-optimal sequences of transitions. This new parser outperforms greedy parsers trained using conventional oracles on a range of data sets, with an average improvement of over 1.2 LAS points and up to almost 3 LAS points on some data sets.",

We propose a new type of clustering criteria, specific to the task of part-of-speech tagging. Instead of distributional similarity, these clusters are based on the beha vior of a baseline tagger when applied to a large corpus. These cluster features provide similar gains in accuracy to those achieved by distributional-similarity derived clusters. Using both types of cluster features together further improve tagging accuracies. We show that the method is effective for both the in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios for English, and for French, German and Italian. The effect is larger for out-of-domain text."

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder.

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase.

            "introduction": " Introduction A new approach for statistical machine transla- tion based purely on neural networks has recently been proposed (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014). This new approach, which we refer to as neural machine translation , is in- spired by the recent trend of deep representational learning. All the neural network models used in (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a ﬁxed-length vector representation from a variable-length input sentence, and from this representation the decoder \u0003Research done while visiting Universit ´e de Montr ´ealgenerates a correct, variable-length target transla- tion. The emergence of the neural machine transla- tion is highly signiﬁcant, both practically and the- oretically. Neural machine translation models re- quire only a fraction of the memory needed by traditional statistical machine translation (SMT) models. The models we trained for this paper require only 500MB of memory in total. This stands in stark contrast with existing SMT sys- tems, which often require tens of gigabytes of memory. This makes the neural machine trans- lation appealing in practice. Furthermore, un- like conventional translation systems, each and ev- ery component of the neural translation model is trained jointly to maximize the translation perfor- mance. As this approach is relatively new, there has not been much work on analyzing the properties and behavior of these models. For instance: What are the properties of sentences on which this ap- proach performs better? How does the choice of source/target vocabulary affect the performance? In which cases does the neural machine translation fail? It is crucial to understand the properties and be- havior of this new neural machine translation ap- proach in order to determine future research di- rections. Also, understanding the weaknesses and strengths of neural machine translation might lead to better ways of integrating SMT and neural ma- chine translation systems. In this paper, we analyze two neural machine translation models. One of them is the RNN Encoder–Decoder that was proposed recently in (Cho et al., 2014). The other model replaces the encoder in the RNN Encoder–Decoder model with a novel neural network, which we call a gated recursive convolutional neural network (grConv). We evaluate these two models on the task of trans- lation from French to English.arXiv:1409.1259v2  [cs.CL]  7 Oct 2014Our analysis shows that the performance of the neural machine translation model degrades quickly as the length of a source sentence in- creases. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the vocabulary size has a high impact on the translation perfor- mance. Nonetheless, qualitatively we ﬁnd that the both models are able to generate correct transla- tions most of the time. Furthermore, the newly proposed grConv model is able to learn, without supervision, a kind of syntactic structure over the source language. 2 Neural Networks for Variable-Length Sequences In this section, we describe two types of neural networks that are able to process variable-length sequences. These are the recurrent neural net- work and the proposed gated recursive convolu- tional neural network. 2.1 Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Hidden Neurons z rh h~x (a) (b) Figure 1: The graphical illustration of (a) the re- current neural network and (b) the hidden unit that adaptively forgets and remembers.

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

Through various experiments, we show first that our models obtain a perplexity with respect to gold translations that is > 43% lower than that of stateof-the-art alignment-based translation models. Secondly, we show that they are remarkably sensitive to the word order, syntax, and meaning of the source sentence despite lacking alignments.

One of the key challenges in sequence transduction is learning to represent both the input and output sequences in a way that is invariant to sequential distortions such as shrinking, stretching and translating. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful sequence learning architecture that has proven capable of learning such representations. However RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between the input and output sequences to perform transduction. This is a severe limitation since \\emph{finding} the alignment is the most difficult aspect of many sequence transduction problems. Indeed, even determining the length of the output sequence is often challenging. This paper introduces an end-to-end, probabilistic sequence transduction system, based entirely on RNNs, that is in principle able to transform any input sequence into any finite, discrete output sequence. Experimental results for phoneme recognition are provided on the TIMIT speech corpus."

These subcorpora -- 1% the size of the original -- can then used to train small domain-adapted Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems which outperform systems trained on the entire corpus. Performance is further improved when we use these domain-adapted models in combination with a true in-domain model. The results show that more training data is not always better, and that best results are attained via proper domain-relevant data selection, as well as combining in- and general-domain systems during decoding."

However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-the-art machine translation system over its BLEU-tuned baseline. \n \nIn this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better human-judged translation quality than the BLEU-tuned baseline.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling – a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1%).

Furthermore, the two phase approach enables sparse solutions when used in conjunction with regularization functions that promote sparsity, such as l1. We derive concrete and very simple algorithms for minimization of loss functions with l1, l2, l22, and l∞ regularization.

The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance."

Second, the approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1-regularization method in the batch setting. We prove small rates of sparsification result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. Finally, the approach works well empirically.

Unigrams can be matched based on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference. We evaluate METEOR by measuring the correlation between the metric scores and human judgments of translation quality. We compute the Pearson R correlation value between its scores and human quality assessments of the LDC TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English datasets. We perform segment-bysegment correlation, and show that METEOR gets an R correlation value of 0.347 on the Arabic data and 0.331 on the Chinese data.

Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive forget gate that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing.

To address this, we introduce a recursive neural network architecture for jointly parsing natural language and learning vector space representations for variable-sized inputs. At the core of our architecture are context-aware recursive neural networks (CRNN). These networks can induce distributed feature representations for unseen phrases and provide syntactic information to accurately predict phrase structure trees. Most excitingly, the representation of each phrase also captures semantic information: For instance, the phrases “decline to comment” and “would not disclose the terms” are close by in the induced embedding space. Our current system achieves an unlabeled bracketing F-measure of 92.1% on the Wall Street Journal development dataset for sentences up to length 15."

                    "abstract": "There have been many different proposals for how conceptual information may be represented in neural networks. These range from extreme localist theories in which each concept is represented by a single neural unit (Barlow 1972) to extreme distributed theories in which a concept corresponds to a pattern of activity over a large part of the cortex. These two extremes are the natural implementations of two different theories of semantics. In the structuralist approach, concepts are defined by their relationships to other concepts rather than by some internal essence. The natural expression of this approach in a neural net is to make each concept be a single unit with no internal structure and to use the connections between units to encode the relationships between concepts. In the componential approach each concept is simply a set offeatures and so a neural net can be made to implement a set of concepts by assigning a unit to each feature and setting the strengths of the connections between units so that each concept corresponds to a stable pattern of activity distributed over the whole network (Hopfield 1982; Kohonen 1977; Willshaw, Buneman, and Longuet-Higgins 1969). The network can then perform concept completion (i.e. retrieve the whole concept from a sufficient subset of its features). The problem with componential theories is that they have little to say about how concepts are used for structured reasoning. They are primarily concerned with the similarities between concepts or with pairwise associations. They provide no obvious way of representing articulated structures composed of a number of concepts playing different roles within the structure."

Here we use these principles to derive several specific classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efficient propagation of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both fineand coarsegrained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for the design of neural architectures are briefly discussed. The protein prediction servers are available over the Web at: www.igb.uci.edu/tools.htm."

The concern of this paper, however, is strictly artiicial: Can hybrids of connectionist learning algorithms and genetic algorithms produce more eecient and eeective algorithms than either technique applied in isolation? The paper begins with a survey of recent work (by us and others) that combines Holland's Genetic Algorithm (GA) with con-nectionist techniques and delineates some of the basic design problems these hybrids share. This analysis suggests the dangers of overly literal representations of the network on the genome (e.g., encoding each weight explicitly). A preliminary set of experiments that use the GA to nd unusual but successful values for BP parameters (learning rate, momentum) are also reported. The focus of the report is a series of experiments that use the GA to explore the space of initial weight values , from which two diierent gradient techniques (conjugate gradient and back propagation) are then allowed to optimize. We nd that use of the GA provides much greater conndence in the face of the stochas-tic variation that can plague gradient techniques, and can also allow training times to be reduced by as much as two orders of magnitude. Computational trade-oos between BP and the GA are considered, including discussion of a software facility that exploits the parallelism inherent in GA/BP hybrids. This evidence leads us to conclude that the GA's global sampling characteristics compliment connectionist local search techniques well, leading to eecient and reliable hybrids."

Improved methodologies could enhance the performance of neural networks in various domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. This research could pave the way for more interpretable models, enabling practitioners to better understand and trust the decisions made by AI systems, ultimately leading to broader adoption and innovation in AI technologies.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in addressing this problem stem from the complexity of designing neural networks that can effectively learn hierarchical representations without overfitting or underutilizing computational resources. Naive approaches may fail due to the difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies in data, which is essential for tasks involving sequential information. Additionally, the optimization of deep learning models in the context of large datasets presents technical obstacles, such as the need for efficient training algorithms and the management of computational costs, which can hinder scalability and performance.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on specific aspects of deep learning, such as architecture design or optimization techniques, without fully addressing the integration of these elements for large-scale data processing. Limitations in computational resources and the lack of comprehensive datasets have also posed barriers to progress. Moreover, existing solutions may not adequately consider the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by proposing a unified framework that combines advanced optimization techniques with novel architectural designs tailored for large datasets.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms to enhance the learning of hierarchical representations. We will utilize a large-scale dataset from a relevant domain, such as image classification or natural language processing, and evaluate our model using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and computational efficiency. The expected outcomes include improved model performance on benchmark tasks, reduced training times, and enhanced interpretability of the learned representations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the identified challenges."

            "introduction": " INTRODUCTION Principal component analysis (PCA) is a standard tool in mod- ern data analysis - in diverse ﬁelds from neuroscience to com- puter graphics - because it is a simple, non-parametric method for extracting relevant information from confusing data sets. With minimal effort PCA provides a roadmap for how to re- duce a complex data set to a lower dimension to reveal the sometimes hidden, simpliﬁed structures that often underlie it. The goal of this tutorial is to provide both an intuitive feel for PCA, and a thorough discussion by largely building on ideas from linear algebra and avoiding challenging topics in statistics and optimization theory (but see Appendix B: Code This code is written for Matlab 6.5 (Release 13) from Mathworks8.

II.Large variances have important structure. This assumption also encompasses the belief that the data has a high SNR. Hence, principal compo- nents with larger associated variances represent interesting structure, while those with lower vari- ances represent noise. Note that this is a strong, and sometimes, incorrect assumption (see Dis- cussion). III.The principal components are orthogonal. This assumption provides an intuitive simpliﬁca- tion that makes PCA soluble with linear algebra decomposition techniques. These techniques are highlighted in the two following sections. We have discussed all aspects of deriving PCA - what remain are the linear algebra solutions. The ﬁrst solution is some- what straightforward while the second solution involves un- derstanding an important algebraic decomposition. V. SOLVING PCA USING EIGENVECTOR DECOMPOSITION We derive our ﬁrst algebraic solution to PCA based on an im- portant property of eigenvector decomposition.

To date, most studies have focused on the regional geology and potential hydrocarbon economics. This chapter discusses an integrated approach for reservoir modeling to reduce uncertainty in this tight-gas field development. In this study, fluvial facies were defined using wireline logs. Object-based modeling was used to integrate well-log facies, object dimension, channel sinuosity, and orientation in building the three-dimensional facies model. The facies model was then used to guide petrophysical property modeling. Dependencies between rock properties were modeled using a geostatistical method. The final model honors the fluvial depositional characteristics and dependencies between the rock properties and was used for better uncertainty management in reservoir simulation and performance forecasting."

                    "Modern visual recognition systems are often limited in their ability to scale to large numbers of object categories. This limitation is in part due to the increasing difficulty of acquiring sufficient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources - such as text data - both to train visual models and to constrain their predictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never seen by the visual model.",
                    "Object recognition and localization are important tasks in computer vision. The focus of this work is the incorporation of contextual information in order to improve object recognition and localization. For instance, it is natural to expect not to see an elephant to appear in the middle of an ocean. We consider a simple approach to encapsulate such common sense knowledge using co-occurrence statistics from web documents. By merely counting the number of times nouns (such as elephants, sharks, oceans, etc.) co-occur in web documents, we obtain a good estimate of expected co-occurrences in visual data. We then cast the problem of combining textual co-occurrence statistics with the predictions of image-based classifiers as an optimization problem. The resulting optimization problem serves as a surrogate for our inference procedure. Albeit the simplicity of the resulting optimization problem, it is effective in improving both recognition and localization accuracy. Concretely, we observe significant improvements in recognition and localization rates for both ImageNet Detection 2012 and Sun 2012 datasets.",
                    "In the paper [1] published in CVPR, we presented a method that can directly use deformable part models (DPMs) trained as in [3]. After training, HOG based part filters are hashed, and, during inference, counts of hashing collisions summed over all hash bands serve as a proxy for part-filter / sliding-window dot products, i.e., filter responses. These counts are an approximation and so we take the original HOG-based filters for the top hash counts and calculate the exact dot products for scoring. It is possible to train DPM models not on HOG data but on a hashed WTA [4] version of this data. The resulting part filters are sparse, real-valued vectors the size of WTA vectors computed from sliding windows. Given the WTA hash of a window, we exactly recover dot products of the top responses using an extension of locality-sensitive hashing. In this supplement, we sketch a method for training such WTA-based models.",
                    "Many object detection systems are constrained by the time required to convolve a target image with a bank of filters that code for different aspects of an object's appearance, such as the presence of component parts. We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times - four orders of magnitude - when compared with performing the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes.",
                    "Abstract: Several recent publications have proposed methods for mapping images into continuous semantic embedding spaces. In some cases the embedding space is trained jointly with the image transformation. In other cases the semantic embedding space is established by an independent natural language processing task, and then the image transformation into that space is learned in a second stage. Proponents of these image embedding systems have stressed their advantages over the traditional \\nway{} classification framing of image understanding, particularly in terms of the promise for zero-shot learning -- the ability to correctly annotate images of previously unseen object categories. In this paper, we propose a simple method for constructing an image embedding system from any existing \\nway{} image classifier and a semantic word embedding model, which contains the $\\n$ class labels in its vocabulary. Our method maps images into the semantic embedding space via convex combination of the class label embedding vectors, and requires no additional training. We show that this simple and direct method confers many of the advantages associated with more complex image embedding schemes, and indeed outperforms state of the art methods on the ImageNet zero-shot learning task.",
                    "We examine the problem of estimating the spike trains of multiple neurons from voltage traces recorded on one or more extracellular electrodes. Traditional spike-sorting methods rely on thresholding or clustering of recorded signals to identify spikes. While these methods can detect a large fraction of the spikes from a recording, they generally fail to identify synchronous or near-synchronous spikes: cases in which multiple spikes overlap. Here we investigate the geometry of failures in traditional sorting algorithms, and document the prevalence of such errors in multi-electrode recordings from primate retina. We then develop a method for multi-neuron spike sorting using a model that explicitly accounts for the superposition of spike waveforms. We model the recorded voltage traces as a linear combination of spike waveforms plus a stochastic background component of correlated Gaussian noise. Combining this measurement model with a Bernoulli prior over binary spike trains yields a posterior distribution for spikes given the recorded data. We introduce a greedy algorithm to maximize this posterior that we call “binary pursuit”. The algorithm allows modest variability in spike waveforms and recovers spike times with higher precision than the voltage sampling rate. This method substantially corrects cross-correlation artifacts that arise with conventional methods, and substantially outperforms clustering methods on both real and simulated data. Finally, we develop diagnostic tools that can be used to assess errors in spike sorting in the absence of ground truth.",
                    "Sensory neurons have been hypothesized to efficiently encode signals from the natural environment subject to resource constraints. The predictions of this efficient coding hypothesis regarding the spatial filtering properties of the visual system have been found consistent with human perception, but they have not been compared directly with neural responses. Here, we analyze the information that retinal ganglion cells transmit to the brain about the spatial information in natural images subject to three resource constraints: the number of retinal ganglion cells, their total response variances, and their total synaptic strengths. We derive a model that optimizes the transmitted information and compare it directly with measurements of complete functional connectivity between cone photoreceptors and the four major types of ganglion cells in the primate retina, obtained at single-cell resolution. We find that the ganglion cell population exhibited 80% efficiency in transmitting spatial information relative to the model. Both the retina and the model exhibited high redundancy (∼30%) among ganglion cells of the same cell type. A novel and unique prediction of efficient coding, the relationships between projection patterns of individual cones to all ganglion cells, was consistent with the observed projection patterns in the retina. These results indicate a high level of efficiency with near-optimal redundancy in visual signaling by the retina.",
                    "    We consider three hypotheses concerning the primate neocortex which have influenced computational neuroscience in recent years. Is the mind modular in terms of its being profitably described as a collection of relatively independent functional units? Does the regular structure of the cortex imply a single algorithm at work, operating on many different inputs in parallel? Can the cognitive differences between humans and our closest primate relatives be explained in terms of a scalable cortical architecture? We bring to bear diverse sources of evidence to argue that the answers to each of these questions — with some judicious qualifications — are in the affirmative. In particular, we argue that while our higher cognitive functions may interact in a complicated fashion, many of the component functions operate through well-defined interfaces and, perhaps more important, are built on a neural substrate that scales easily under the control of a modular genetic architecture. Processing in the primary sensory cortices seem amenable to similar algorithmic principles, and, even for those cases where alternative principles are at play, the regular structure of cortex allows the same or greater advantages as the architecture scales. Similar genetic machinery to that used by nature to scale body plans has apparently been applied to scale cortical computations. The resulting replicated computing units can be used to build larger working memory and support deeper recursions needed to qualitatively improve our abilities to handle language, abstraction and social interaction.

                    "This paper examines the correlated firing among multiple ganglion cell types in the retina. For many years it has been known that ganglion cells exhibit a tendency to fire simultaneously more or less frequently than would be predicted by chance. However, the particular patterns of correlated activity in the primate retina have been unclear. Here we reveal systematic, distance‐dependent correlations between different ganglion cell types. For the most part, the patterns of activity are consistent with a model in which noise in cone photoreceptors propagates through common retinal circuitry, creating correlations among ganglion cell signals.",

                    "Synchronized firing among neurons has been proposed to constitute an elementary aspect of the neural code in sensory and motor systems. However, it remains unclear how synchronized firing affects the large-scale patterns of activity and redundancy of visual signals in a complete population of neurons. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of retinal ganglion cells in primate retina, and examined synchronized firing in completely sampled populations of ∼50–100 ON-parasol cells, which form a major projection to the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Synchronized firing in pairs of cells was a subset of a much larger pattern of activity that exhibited local, isotropic spatial properties. However, a simple model based solely on interactions between adjacent cells reproduced 99% of the spatial structure and scale of synchronized firing. No more than 20% of the variability in firing of an individual cell was predictable from the activity of its neighbors. These results held both for spontaneous firing and in the presence of independent visual modulation of the firing of each cell. In sum, large-scale synchronized firing in the entire population of ON-parasol cells appears to reflect simple neighbor interactions, rather than a unique visual signal or a highly redundant coding scheme.",
                    "The collective representation of visual space in high resolution visual pathways was explored by simultaneously measuring the receptive fields of hundreds of ON and OFF midget and parasol ganglion cells in isolated primate retina. As expected, the receptive fields of all four cell types formed regular mosaics uniformly tiling the visual scene. Surprisingly, comparison of all four mosaics revealed that the overlap of neighboring receptive fields was nearly identical, for both the excitatory center and inhibitory surround components of the receptive field. These observations contrast sharply with the large differences in the dendritic overlap between the parasol and midget cell populations, revealing a surprising lack of correspondence between the anatomical and functional architecture in the dominant circuits of the primate retina.",
                    "In the visual system, large ensembles of neurons collectively sample visual space with receptive fields (RFs). A puzzling problem is how neural ensembles provide a uniform, high-resolution visual representation in spite of irregularities in the RFs of individual cells. This problem was approached by simultaneously mapping the RFs of hundreds of primate retinal ganglion cells. As observed in previous studies, RFs exhibited irregular shapes that deviated from standard Gaussian models. Surprisingly, these irregularities were coordinated at a fine spatial scale: RFs interlocked with their neighbors, filling in gaps and avoiding large variations in overlap. RF shapes were coordinated with high spatial precision: the observed uniformity was degraded by angular perturbations as small as 15°, and the observed populations sampled visual space with more than 50% of the theoretical ideal uniformity. These results show that the primate retina encodes light with an exquisitely coordinated array of RF shapes, illustrating a higher degree of functional precision in the neural circuitry than previously appreciated."

An improved PCA method could lead to more accurate data interpretations, facilitate better decision-making, and inspire further research into dimensionality reduction techniques. Additionally, advancements in PCA could lead to practical applications in areas like image processing, genomics, and machine learning, where efficient data analysis is paramount.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenges in improving PCA stem from its reliance on assumptions such as high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the orthogonality of principal components. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the potential misrepresentation of noise as significant structure in the data. Moreover, the computational complexity of eigenvector decomposition and singular value decomposition (SVD) can be prohibitive for large datasets, necessitating the development of more efficient algorithms that still adhere to the theoretical foundations of PCA.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research on PCA has primarily focused on its theoretical underpinnings and straightforward implementations, often overlooking the need for computational efficiency and practical applicability in real-world scenarios. Barriers such as a lack of innovative algorithmic approaches and the complexity of existing methods have hindered progress. My approach aims to bridge these gaps by introducing novel techniques that enhance both the speed and interpretability of PCA, while also addressing the limitations of traditional methods.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nMy proposed methodology involves developing a new algorithm that optimizes PCA through advanced matrix factorization techniques, utilizing a large dataset from a relevant domain (e.g., image or genomic data). I will evaluate the performance of this algorithm using metrics such as explained variance and computational time compared to traditional PCA methods. The expected outcomes include a more efficient PCA implementation that retains high accuracy in data representation, ultimately leading to better insights and applications in various fields."

We address these issues with a dedicated algorithm that carefully determines the local statistics to be transferred. We ensure both spatial and inter-scale statistical consistency and demonstrate that both aspects are key to generating quality results. To cope with the diversity of abstraction levels and types of paintings, we introduce a technique to adjust the parameters of the transfer depending on the painting.

            "introduction": " Introduction Image compositing is a key operation to create new visual con- tent. It allows artists to remix existing materials into new pieces and artists such as Man Ray and David Hockney have created mas- terpieces using this technique. Compositing can be used in differ- ent contexts. In applications like photo collage, visible seams are desirable. But in others, the objective is to make the compositing inconspicuous, for instance, to add an object into a photograph in a way that makes it look like the object was present in the original scene. Many tools have been developed for photographiccompositing, e.g., to remove boundary seams [PGB03], match the color [XADR12] or also ﬁne texture [SJMP10]. However, there is no equivalent for paintings. If one seeks to add an object into a painting, the options are limited. One can paint the object man- ually or with a painting engine [CKIW15] but this requires time and skills that few people have. As we shall see, resorting to algo- rithms designed for photographs produces subpar Related Work Image Harmonization. The simplest way to blend images is to combine the foreground and background painting. Our methods and our Background Our work builds upon the style transfer technique introduced by Gatys et al. [GEB16] (Neural Style) and several additional recon- struction losses proposed later to improve its experiments show that our approach succeeds on a diversity of input and style images, many of which are challenging for other Discussion. Our constrained mapping was inspired by the nearest-neighbor ﬁeld upsampling used in the Deep Analogywork [LYY\u000317, § 4.4] that constrains the matches at each layer to come from a local region around the location at a previous layer. When the input and style images are similar, this technique per- forms well. In our context, the intermediate image and the style image are even more similar. This encouraged us to be even stricter by forcing the matches to come from the exact same location. Be- side this similar aspect, the other algorithmic parts are different and as we shall see, our approach produces better Results of the “Comparison” user study. Our algorithm is often the most preferred among the four algorithms. Image Harmonization Comparisons. We compare our related work and through user studies. Main Conclusions We have described an algorithm to copy an object in a photograph and paste it into a painting seamlessly, i.e., the composite still looks like a genuine painting. We have introduced a two-pass algorithm that ﬁrst transfers the overall style of the painting to the input and then reﬁnes the result to accurately match the painting’s color and texture. This latter pass relies on mapping neural response statis- tics that ensures consistency across the network layers and in im- age space. To cope with different painting styles, we have trained a separate network to adjust the transfer parameters as a function of the style of the References [BSFG09] B ARNES C., S HECHTMAN E., F INKELSTEIN A., G OLDMAN D.

Existing feed-forward based methods, while enjoying the inference efficiency, are mainly limited by inability of generalizing to unseen styles or compromised visual quality. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that tackles these limitations without training on any pre-defined styles. The key ingredient of our method is a pair of feature transforms, whitening and coloring, that are embedded to an image reconstruction network. The whitening and coloring transforms reflect a direct matching of feature covariance of the content image to a given style image, which shares similar spirits with the optimization of Gram matrix based cost in neural style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by generating high-quality stylized images with comparisons to a number of recent methods. We also analyze our method by visualizing the whitened features and synthesizing textures via simple feature coloring."

By visual attribute transfer, we mean transfer of visual information (such as color, tone, texture, and style) from one image to another. For example, one image could be that of a painting or a sketch while the other is a photo of a real scene, and both depict the same type of scene. Our technique finds semantically-meaningful dense correspondences between two input images. To accomplish this, it adapts the notion of \"image analogy\" [Hertzmann et al. 2001] with features extracted from a Deep Convolutional Neutral Network for matching; we call our technique deep image analogy. A coarse-to-fine strategy is used to compute the nearest-neighbor field for generating the results. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in a variety of cases, including style/texture transfer, color/style swap, sketch/painting to photo, and time lapse."

Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. Our contribution is to constrain the transformation from the input to the output to be locally affine in colorspace, and to express this constraint as a custom fully differentiable energy term.

Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color & spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network."

To generate realistic composites, the appearances of foreground and background need to be adjusted to make them compatible. Previous approaches to harmonize composites have focused on learning statistical relationships between hand-crafted appearance features of the foreground and background, which is unreliable especially when the contents in the two layers are vastly different. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network for image harmonization, which can capture both the context and semantic information of the composite images during harmonization. We also introduce an efficient way to collect large-scale and high-quality training data that can facilitate the training process. Experiments on the synthesized dataset and real composite images show that the proposed network outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods."

These methods are exciting because they can in some cases create results with state-of-the-art quality. However, in this paper, we show these methods also have limitations in texture quality, stability, requisite parameter tuning, and lack of user controls. This paper presents a multiscale synthesis pipeline based on convolutional neural networks that ameliorates these issues. We first give a mathematical explanation of the source of instabilities in many previous approaches. We then improve these instabilities by using histogram losses to synthesize textures that better statistically match the exemplar. We also show how to integrate localized style losses in our multiscale framework. These losses can improve the quality of large features, improve the separation of content and style, and offer artistic controls such as paint by numbers. We demonstrate that our approach offers improved quality, convergence in fewer iterations, and more stability over the optimization."

We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous wellknown artworks.

Based on this representation, we develop a variety of techniques to ensure the performance and robustness of our simulator under large time steps, including brush and particle simulations in non-inertial frames, a fixed-point method for accelerating Jacobi iterations, and a new Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for simulating detailed liquid effects. The resulting system can realistically simulate not only the motions of brush bristles and paint liquid, but also the liquid transfer processes among different representations. We implement the whole system on GPU by CUDA. Our experiment shows that artists can use the system to draw realistic and vivid digital paintings, by applying the painting techniques that they are familiar with but not offered by many existing systems."

To answer this question we contribute a general framework to invert representations. We show that this method can invert representations such as HOG more accurately than recent alternatives while being applicable to CNNs too. We then use this technique to study the inverse of recent state-of-the-art CNN image representations for the first time.

Second, we integrate image gradients into the patch representation and replace the usual color averaging with a screened Poisson equation solver. And third, we propose a new energy based on mixed L2/L0 norms for colors and gradients that produces a gradual transition between sources without sacrificing texture sharpness. Together, all three generalizations enable patch-based solutions to a broad class of image melding problems involving inconsistent sources: object cloning, stitching challenging panoramas, hole filling from multiple photos, and image harmonization. In several cases, our unified method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for those applications."

At the heart of this framework is a multi-scale technique that allows us to transfer the appearance of one image to another. We show that by carefully manipulating the scales of a pyramid decomposition of an image, we can match contrast, texture, noise, and blur, while avoiding image artifacts. The output composite can then be reconstructed from the modified pyramid coefficients while enforcing both alpha-based and seamless boundary constraints.

In this paper, we present a technique for creating camouflage images. To foil the feature search, we remove the original subtle texture details of the hidden figures and replace them by that of the surrounding apparent image. To leave an appropriate degree of clues for the conjunction search, we compute and assign new tones to regions in the embedded figures by performing an optimization between two conflicting terms, which we call immersion and standout, corresponding to hiding and leaving clues, respectively.

This one simple algorithm forms the basis for a variety of tools -- image retargeting, completion and reshuffling -- that can be used together in the context of a high-level image editing application.

However, as is, this approach is not suitable for photorealistic style transfer. Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. Our contribution is to constrain the transformation from the input to the output to be locally affine in colorspace, and to express this constraint as a custom fully differentiable energy term.

One direction to solve this problem is to do adaptive sampling and reconstruction, which generates final images by adaptive sampling and filtering with single or multiple iterations.

                    "Natural images often exhibit symmetries that should be taken into account when editing them. In this paper we present Nautilus --- a method for automatically identifying symmetric regions in an image along with their corresponding symmetry transformations. We compute dense local similarity symmetry transformations using a novel variant of the Generalised PatchMatch algorithm that uses Metropolis-Hastings sampling. We combine and refine these local symmetries using an extended Lucas-Kanade algorithm to compute regional transformations and their spatial extents. Our approach produces dense estimates of complex symmetries that are combinations of translation, rotation, scale, and reflection under perspective distortion. This enables a number of automatic symmetry-aware image editing applications including inpainting, rectification, beautification, and segmentation, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art applications for each of them.",
                    "Patch-based image synthesis methods have been successfully applied for various editing tasks on still images, videos and stereo pairs. In this work we extend patch-based synthesis to plenoptic images captured by consumer-level lenselet-based devices for interactive, efficient light field editing. In our method the light field is represented as a set of images captured from different viewpoints. We decompose the central view into different depth layers, and present it to the user for specifying the editing goals. Given an editing task, our method performs patch-based image synthesis on all affected layers of the central view, and then propagates the edits to all other views. Interaction is done through a conventional 2D image editing user interface that is familiar to novice users. Our method correctly handles object boundary occlusion with semi-transparency, thus can generate more realistic results than previous methods. We demonstrate compelling results on a wide range of applications such as hole-filling, object reshuffling and resizing, changing object depth, light field upscaling and parallax magnification.",
                    "Many image-to-image translation problems are ambiguous, as a single input image may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we aim to model a \\emph{distribution} of possible outputs in a conditional generative modeling setting. The ambiguity of the mapping is distilled in a low-dimensional latent vector, which can be randomly sampled at test time. A generator learns to map the given input, combined with this latent code, to the output. We explicitly encourage the connection between output and the latent code to be invertible. This helps prevent a many-to-one mapping from the latent code to the output during training, also known as the problem of mode collapse, and produces more diverse results. We explore several variants of this approach by employing different training objectives, network architectures, and methods of injecting the latent code. Our proposed method encourages bijective consistency between the latent encoding and output modes. We present a systematic comparison of our method and other variants on both perceptual realism and diversity.",
                    "A common way to generate high-quality product images is to start with a physically-based render of a 3D scene, apply image-based edits on individual render channels, and then composite the edited channels together (in some cases, on top of a background photograph). This workflow requires users to manually select the right render channels, prescribe channel-specific masks, and set appropriate edit parameters. Unfortunately, such edits cannot be easily reused for global variations of the original scene, such as a rigid-body transformation of the 3D objects or a modified viewpoint, which discourages iterative refinement of both global scene changes and image-based edits. We propose a method to automatically transfer such user edits across variations of object geometry, illumination, and viewpoint. This transfer problem is challenging since many edits may be visually plausible but non-physical, with a successful transfer dependent on an unknown set of scene attributes that may include both photometric and non-photometric features. To address this challenge, we present a transfer algorithm that extends the image analogies formulation to include an augmented set of photometric and non-photometric guidance channels and, more importantly, adaptively estimate weights for the various candidate channels in a way that matches the characteristics of each individual edit. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of complex edit-transfer scenarios for creating high-quality product images.",
                    "Lighting is a critical element of portrait photography. However, good lighting design typically requires complex equipment and significant time and expertise. Our work simplifies this task using a relighting technique that transfers the desired illumination of one portrait onto another. The novelty in our approach to this challenging problem is our formulation of relighting as a mass transport problem. We start from standard color histogram matching that only captures the overall tone of the illumination, and we show how to use the mass-transport formulation to make it dependent on facial geometry. We fit a three-dimensional (3D) morphable face model to the portrait, and for each pixel, we combine the color value with the corresponding 3D position and normal. We then solve a mass-transport problem in this augmented space to generate a color remapping that achieves localized, geometry-aware relighting. Our technique is robust to variations in facial appearance and small errors in face reconstruction. As we demonstrate, this allows our technique to handle a variety of portraits and illumination conditions, including scenarios that are challenging for previous methods.",
                    "We introduce a novel approach to example-based stylization of portrait videos that preserves both the subject's identity and the visual richness of the input style exemplar. Unlike the current state-of-the-art based on neural style transfer [Selim et al. 2016], our method performs non-parametric texture synthesis that retains more of the local textural details of the artistic exemplar and does not suffer from image warping artifacts caused by aligning the style exemplar with the target face. Our method allows the creation of videos with less than full temporal coherence [Ruder et al. 2016]. By introducing a controllable amount of temporal dynamics, it more closely approximates the appearance of real hand-painted animation in which every frame was created independently. We demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed solution on a variety of style exemplars and target videos.",
                    "This paper introduces a deep-learning approach to photographic style transfer that handles a large variety of image content while faithfully transferring the reference style. Our approach builds upon the recent work on painterly transfer that separates style from the content of an image by considering different layers of a neural network. However, as is, this approach is not suitable for photorealistic style transfer. Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. Our contribution is to constrain the transformation from the input to the output to be locally affine in colorspace, and to express this constraint as a custom fully differentiable energy term. We show that this approach successfully suppresses distortion and yields satisfying photorealistic style transfers in a broad variety of scenarios, including transfer of the time of day, weather, season, and artistic edits.",
                    "In this work, we focus on the challenge of taking partial observations of highly-stylized text and generalizing the observations to generate unobserved glyphs in the ornamented typeface. To generate a set of multi-content images following a consistent style from very few examples, we propose an end-to-end stacked conditional GAN model considering content along channels and style along network layers. Our proposed network transfers the style of given glyphs to the contents of unseen ones, capturing highly stylized fonts found in the real-world such as those on movie posters or infographics. We seek to transfer both the typographic stylization (ex. serifs and ears) as well as the textual stylization (ex. color gradients and effects.) We base our experiments on our collected data set including 10,000 fonts with different styles and demonstrate effective generalization from a very small number of observed glyphs.",
                    "Traditional face editing methods often require a number of sophisticated and task specific algorithms to be applied one after the other &#x2014; a process that is tedious, fragile, and computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end generative adversarial network that infers a face-specific disentangled representation of intrinsic face properties, including shape (i.e. normals), albedo, and lighting, and an alpha matte. We show that this network can be trained on in-the-wild images by incorporating an in-network physically-based image formation module and appropriate loss functions. Our disentangling latent representation allows for semantically relevant edits, where one aspect of facial appearance can be manipulated while keeping orthogonal properties fixed, and we demonstrate its use for a number of facial editing applications.",
                    "In many computer vision tasks, for example saliency prediction or semantic segmentation, the desired output is a foreground map that predicts pixels where some criteria is satisfied. Despite the inherently spatial nature of this task commonly used learning objectives do not incorporate the spatial relationships between misclassified pixels and the underlying ground truth. The Weighted F-measure, a recently proposed evaluation metric, does reweight errors spatially, and has been shown to closely correlate with human evaluation of quality, and stably rank predictions with respect to noisy ground truths (such as a sloppy human annotator might generate). However it suffers from computational complexity which makes it intractable as an optimization objective for gradient descent, which must be evaluated thousands or millions of times while learning a model's parameters. We propose a differentiable and efficient approximation of this metric. By incorporating spatial information into the objective we can use a simpler model than competing methods without sacrificing accuracy, resulting in faster inference speeds and alleviating the need for pre/post-processing. We match (or improve) performance on several tasks compared to prior state of the art by traditional metrics, and in many cases significantly improve performance by the weighted F-measure.",
                    "Many image-to-image translation problems are ambiguous, with a single input image corresponding to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we aim to model a distribution of possible outputs in a conditional generative modeling setting. The ambiguity of the mapping is encoded in a low-dimensional latent vector, which can be randomly sampled at test time. A generator learns to map the input, along with the latent code, to an output. We explicitly enforce cycle consistency between the latent code and the output. Encouraging invertibility helps prevent a many-to-one mapping from the latent code to the output during training, also known as the problem of mode collapse, and helps produce more diverse results. We evaluate the relationship between perceptual realism and diversity of images generated by our method, and test on a variety of domains.",
                    "Recent work has shown impressive success in transferring painterly style to images. These approaches, however, fall short of photorealistic style transfer. Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. In this paper we propose an approach that takes as input a stylized image and makes it more photorealistic. It relies on the Screened Poisson Equation, maintaining the fidelity of the stylized image while constraining the gradients to those of the original input image. Our method is fast, simple, fully automatic and shows positive progress in making a stylized image photorealistic. Our results exhibit finer details and are less prone to artifacts than the state-of-the-art.",
                    "We consider retrieving a specific temporal segment, or moment, from a video given a natural language text description. Methods designed to retrieve whole video clips with natural language determine what occurs in a video but not when. To address this issue, we propose the Moment Context Network (MCN) which effectively localizes natural language queries in videos by integrating local and global video features over time. A key obstacle to training our MCN model is that current video datasets do not include pairs of localized video segments and referring expressions, or text descriptions which uniquely identify a corresponding moment. Therefore, we collect the Distinct Describable Moments (DiDeMo) dataset which consists of over 10,000 unedited, personal videos in diverse visual settings with pairs of localized video segments and referring expressions. We demonstrate that MCN outperforms several baseline methods and believe that our initial results together with the release of DiDeMo will inspire further research on localizing video moments with natural language.",
                    "This note presents an extension to the neural artistic style transfer algorithm (Gatys et al.). The original algorithm transforms an image to have the style of another given image. For example, a photograph can be transformed to have the style of a famous painting. Here we address a potential shortcoming of the original method: the algorithm transfers the colors of the original painting, which can alter the appearance of the scene in undesirable ways. We describe simple linear methods for transferring style while preserving colors.",

The mean F1 score is 0.69719. The mean F1 score on hidden test set is 0.69059.",
                    "We propose a method to remove objects such as people and cars from multi-view urban image datasets, enabling free-viewpoint IBR in the edited scenes. Our method combines information from multi-view 3D reconstruction with image inpainting techniques, by formulating the problem as an optimization of a global patch-based objective function. We use Image-Based Rendering (IBR) techniques to reproject information from neighboring views, and 3D multi-view stereo reconstruction to perform multiview coherent initialization for inpainting of pixels not filled by reprojection. Our algorithm performs multi-view consistent inpainting for color and 3D by blending reprojections with patch-based image inpainting. We run our algorithm on casually captured datasets, and Google StreetViewdata, removing objects cars, people and pillars, showing that our approach produces results of sufficient quality for free-viewpoint IBR on \"cleaned up\" scenes, as well as IBR scene editing, such as limited motion of real objects.",
                    "Shadow removal is a challenging problem and previous approaches often produce de‐shadowed regions that are visually inconsistent with the rest of the image. We propose an automatic shadow region harmonization approach that makes the appearance of a de‐shadowed region (produced using any previous technique) compatible with the rest of the image. We use a shadow‐guided patch‐based image synthesis approach that reconstructs the shadow region using patches sampled from non‐shadowed regions. This result is then refined based on the reconstruction confidence to handle unique textures. Qualitative comparisons over a wide range of images, and a quantitative evaluation on a benchmark dataset show that our technique significantly improves upon the state‐of‐the‐art.",
                    "Recent advances in deep learning have shown exciting promise in filling large holes in natural images with semantically plausible and context aware details, impacting fundamental image manipulation tasks such as object removal. While these learning-based methods are significantly more effective in capturing high-level features than prior techniques, they can only handle very low-resolution inputs due to memory limitations and difficulty in training. Even for slightly larger images, the inpainted regions would appear blurry and unpleasant boundaries become visible. We propose a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach based on joint optimization of image content and texture constraints, which not only preserves contextual structures but also produces high-frequency details by matching and adapting patches with the most similar mid-layer feature correlations of a deep classification network. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet and Paris Streetview datasets and achieved state-of-the-art inpainting accuracy. We show our approach produces sharper and more coherent results than prior methods, especially for high-resolution images.",
                    "Closed eyes and look-aways can ruin precious moments captured in photographs. In this article, we present a new framework for automatically editing eyes in photographs. We leverage a user’s personal photo collection to find a “good” set of reference eyes and transfer them onto a target image. Our example-based editing approach is robust and effective for realistic image editing. A fully automatic pipeline for realistic eye editing is challenging due to the unconstrained conditions under which the face appears in a typical photo collection. We use crowd-sourced human evaluations to understand the aspects of the target-reference image pair that will produce the most realistic results. We subsequently train a model that automatically selects the top-ranked reference candidate(s) by narrowing the gap in terms of pose, local contrast, lighting conditions, and even expressions. Finally, we develop a comprehensive pipeline of three-dimensional face estimation, image warping, relighting, image harmonization, automatic segmentation, and image compositing in order to achieve highly believable results. We evaluate the performance of our method via quantitative and crowd-sourced experiments.",
                    "This paper introduces a method to modify the apparent relative pose and distance between camera and subject given a single portrait photo. Our approach fits a full perspective camera and a parametric 3D head model to the portrait, and then builds a 2D warp in the image plane to approximate the effect of a desired change in 3D. We show that this model is capable of correcting objectionable artifacts such as the large noses sometimes seen in \"selfies,\" or to deliberately bring a distant camera closer to the subject. This framework can also be used to re-pose the subject, as well as to create stereo pairs from an input portrait. We show convincing results on both an existing dataset as well as a new dataset we captured to validate our method."

                    "Understanding shading effects in images is critical for a variety of vision and graphics problems, including intrinsic image decomposition, shadow removal, image relighting, and inverse rendering. As is the case with other vision tasks, machine learning is a promising approach to understanding shading - but there is little ground truth shading data available for real-world images. We introduce Shading Annotations in the Wild (SAW), a new large-scale, public dataset of shading annotations in indoor scenes, comprised of multiple forms of shading judgments obtained via crowdsourcing, along with shading annotations automatically generated from RGB-D imagery. We use this data to train a convolutional neural network to predict per-pixel shading information in an image. We demonstrate the value of our data and network in an application to intrinsic images, where we can reduce decomposition artifacts produced by existing algorithms. Our database is available at http://opensurfaces.cs.cornell.edu/saw.",
                    "Each day billions of photographs are uploaded to photo-sharing services and social media platforms. These images are packed with information about how people live around the world. In this paper we exploit this rich trove of data to understand fashion and style trends worldwide. We present a framework for visual discovery at scale, analyzing clothing and fashion across millions of images of people around the world and spanning several years. We introduce a large-scale dataset of photos of people annotated with clothing attributes, and use this dataset to train attribute classifiers via deep learning. We also present a method for discovering visually consistent style clusters that capture useful visual correlations in this massive dataset. Using these tools, we analyze millions of photos to derive visual insight, producing a first-of-its-kind analysis of global and per-city fashion choices and spatio-temporal trends.",
                    "This paper introduces a deep-learning approach to photographic style transfer that handles a large variety of image content while faithfully transferring the reference style. Our approach builds upon the recent work on painterly transfer that separates style from the content of an image by considering different layers of a neural network. However, as is, this approach is not suitable for photorealistic style transfer. Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. Our contribution is to constrain the transformation from the input to the output to be locally affine in colorspace, and to express this constraint as a custom fully differentiable energy term. We show that this approach successfully suppresses distortion and yields satisfying photorealistic style transfers in a broad variety of scenarios, including transfer of the time of day, weather, season, and artistic edits.",
                    "Intrinsic images are a mid‐level representation of an image that decompose the image into reflectance and illumination layers. The reflectance layer captures the color/texture of surfaces in the scene, while the illumination layer captures shading effects caused by interactions between scene illumination and surface geometry. Intrinsic images have a long history in computer vision and recently in computer graphics, and have been shown to be a useful representation for tasks ranging from scene understanding and reconstruction to image editing. In this report, we review and evaluate past work on this problem. Specifically, we discuss each work in terms of the priors they impose on the intrinsic image problem. We introduce a new synthetic ground‐truth dataset that we use to evaluate the validity of these priors and the performance of the methods. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the different methods in the context of image‐editing applications.",
                    "Our goal is to curate a dataset that is generally useful to tasks that use shading estimation. One specifically important task is intrinsic image decomposition. Since the majority of intrinsic image decomposition algorithms make a Lambertian assumption, and disregard specular surfaces, we want to eliminate points that have a substantial glossy component. Unfortunately, the IIW [2] dataset did not take this into account. We address this limitation of IIW by annotating all old and new points in the IIW dataset with a “glossy” label.",
                    "Procedural textile models are compact, easy to edit, and can achieve state‐of‐the‐art realism with fiber‐level details. However, these complex models generally need to be fully instantiated (aka. realized) into 3D volumes or fiber meshes and stored in memory, We introduce a novel realization‐minimizing technique that enables physically based rendering of procedural textiles, without the need of full model realizations. The key ingredients of our technique are new data structures and search algorithms that look up regular and flyaway fibers on the fly, efficiently and consistently. Our technique works with compact fiber‐level procedural yarn models in their exact form with no approximation imposed. In practice, our method can render very large models that are practically unrenderable using existing methods, while using considerably less memory (60–200× less) and achieving good performance.",
                    "Rendering fabrics using micro-appearance models---fiber-level microgeometry coupled with a fiber scattering model---can take hours per frame. We present a fast, precomputation-based algorithm for rendering both single and multiple scattering in fabrics with repeating structure illuminated by directional and spherical Gaussian lights. Precomputed light transport (PRT) is well established but challenging to apply directly to cloth. This paper shows how to decompose the problem and pick the right approximations to achieve very high accuracy, with significant performance gains over path tracing. We treat single and multiple scattering separately and approximate local multiple scattering using precomputed transfer functions represented in spherical harmonics. We handle shadowing between fibers with precomputed per-fiber-segment visibility functions, using two different representations to separately deal with low and high frequency spherical Gaussian lights. Our algorithm is designed for GPU performance and high visual quality. Compared to existing PRT methods, it is more accurate. In tens of seconds on a commodity GPU, it renders high-quality supersampled images that take path tracing tens of minutes on a compute cluster.",
                    "The growth of online marketplaces for selling goods has increased the need for product photography by novice users and consumers. Additionally, the increased use of online media and large-screen billboards promotes the adoption of videos for advertising, going beyond just using still imagery. Lighting is a key distinction between professional and casual product videography. Professionals use specialized hardware setups, and bring expert skills to create good lighting that shows off the product's shape and material, while also producing aesthetically pleasing results. In this paper, we introduce a new do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to lighting design that lets novice users create studio quality product videography. We identify design principles to light products through emphasizing highlights, rim lighting, and contours. We devise a set of computational metrics to achieve these design goals. Our workflow is: the user acquires a video of the product by mounting a video camera on a tripod and using a tablet to light objects by waving the tablet around the object. We automatically analyze and split this acquired video into snippets that match our design principles. Finally, we present an interface that lets users easily select snippets with specific characteristics and then assembles them to produce a final pleasing video of the product. Alternatively, they can rely on our template mechanism to automatically assemble a video.",
                    "We propose a new neural network architecture for solving single-image analogies - the generation of an entire set of stylistically similar images from just a single input image. Solving this problem requires separating image style from content. Our network is a modified variational autoencoder (VAE) that supports supervised training of single-image analogies and in-network evaluation of outputs with a structured similarity objective that captures pixel covariances. On the challenging task of generating a 62-letter font from a single example letter we produce images with 22.4% lower dissimilarity to the ground truth than state-of-the-art.",
                    "    Scene understanding algorithms in computer vision are improving dramatically by training deep convolutional neural networks on millions of accurately annotated images. Collecting large-scale datasets for this kind of training is challenging, and the learning algorithms are only as good as the data they train on. Training annotations are often obtained by taking the majority label from independent crowdsourced workers using platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. However, the accuracy of the resulting annotations can vary, with the hardest-to-annotate samples having prohibitively low accuracy. Our insight is that in cases where independent worker annotations are poor more accurate results can be obtained by having workers collaborate. This paper introduces consensus agreement games, a novel method for assigning annotations to images by the agreement of multiple consensuses of small cliques of workers. We demonstrate that this approach reduces error by 37.8% on two different datasets at a cost of $0.10 or $0.17 per annotation. The higher cost is justified because our method does not need to be run on the entire dataset. Ultimately, our method enables us to more accurately annotate images and build more challenging training datasets for learning algorithms.   ",
                    "Fabrics play a significant role in many applications in design, prototyping, and entertainment. Recent fiber-based models capture the rich visual appearance of fabrics, but are too onerous to design and edit. Yarn-based procedural models are powerful and convenient, but too regular and not realistic enough in appearance. In this paper, we introduce an automatic fitting approach to create high-quality procedural yarn models of fabrics with fiber-level details. We fit CT data to procedural models to automatically recover a full range of parameters, and augment the models with a measurement-based model of flyaway fibers. We validate our fabric models against CT measurements and photographs, and demonstrate the utility of this approach for fabric modeling and editing.",
                    "We propose Deep Feature Interpolation (DFI), a new data-driven baseline for automatic high-resolution image transformation. As the name suggests, DFI relies only on simple linear interpolation of deep convolutional features from pre-trained convnets. We show that despite its simplicity, DFI can perform high-level semantic transformations like make older/younger, make bespectacled, add smile, among others, surprisingly well&#x2013;sometimes even matching or outperforming the state-of-the-art. This is particularly unexpected as DFI requires no specialized network architecture or even any deep network to be trained for these tasks. DFI therefore can be used as a new baseline to evaluate more complex algorithms and provides a practical answer to the question of which image transformation tasks are still challenging after the advent of deep learning.",
                    "We present a method for computing ambient occlusion (AO) for a stack of images of a Lambertian scene from a fixed viewpoint. Ambient occlusion, a concept common in computer graphics, characterizes the local visibility at a point: it approximates how much light can reach that point from different directions without getting blocked by other geometry. While AO has received surprisingly little attention in vision, we show that it can be approximated using simple, per-pixel statistics over image stacks, based on a simplified image formation model. We use our derived AO measure to compute reflectance and illumination for objects without relying on additional smoothness priors, and demonstrate state-of-the art performance on the MIT Intrinsic Images benchmark. We also demonstrate our method on several synthetic and real scenes, including 3D printed objects with known ground truth geometry.",
                    "Modeling the appearance of outdoor scenes from photo collections is challenging because of appearance variation, especially due to illumination. In this paper we present a simple and robust algorithm for estimating illumination properties-shadows and sun direction-from photo collections. These properties are key to a variety of scene modeling applications, including outdoor intrinsic images, realistic 3D scene rendering, and temporally varying (4D) reconstruction. Our shadow detection method uses illumination ratios to analyze lighting independent of camera effects, and determines shadow labels for each 3D point in a reconstruction. These shadow labels can then be used to detect shadow boundaries and estimate sun direction, as well as to compute dense shadow labels in pixel space. We demonstrate our method on large Internet photo collections of scenes, and show that it outperforms prior multi-image shadow detection and sun direction estimation methods.",
                    "Photographers often “prep” their subjects to achieve various effects; for example, toning down overly shiny skin, covering blotches, etc. Making such adjustments digitally after a shoot is possible, but difficult without good tools and good skills. Making such adjustments to video footage is harder still. We describe and study a set of 2D image operations, based on multiscale image analysis, that are easy and straightforward and that can consistently modify perceived material properties. These operators first build a subband decomposition of the image and then selectively modify the coefficients within the subbands. We call this selection process band sifting. We show that different siftings of the coefficients can be used to modify the appearance of properties such as gloss, smoothness, pigmentation, or weathering. The band-sifting operators have particularly striking effects when applied to faces; they can provide “knobs” to make a face look wetter or drier, younger or older, and with heavy or light variation in pigmentation. Through user studies, we identify a set of operators that yield consistent subjective effects for a variety of materials and scenes. We demonstrate that these operators are also useful for processing video sequences.",
                    "Edges in images of translucent objects are very different from edges in images of opaque objects. The physical causes for these differences are hard to characterize analytically and are not well understood. This paper considers one class of translucency edges-those caused by a discontinuity in surface orientation-and describes the physical causes of their appearance. We simulate thousands of translucency edge profiles using many different scattering material parameters, and we explain the resulting variety of edge patterns by qualitatively analyzing light transport. We also discuss the existence of shape and material metamers, or combinations of distinct shape or material parameters that generate the same edge profile. This knowledge is relevant to visual inference tasks that involve translucent objects, such as shape or material estimation.",
                    "With the rapid proliferation of smart mobile devices, users now take millions of photos every day. These include large numbers of clothing and accessory images. We would like to answer questions like 'What outfit goes well with this pair of shoes?' To answer these types of questions, one has to go beyond learning visual similarity and learn a visual notion of compatibility across categories. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to help answer these types of questions. The main idea of this framework is to learn a feature transformation from images of items into a latent space that expresses compatibility. For the feature transformation, we use a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, where training examples are pairs of items that are either compatible or incompatible. We model compatibility based on co-occurrence in large-scale user behavior data, in particular co-purchase data from Amazon.com. To learn cross-category fit, we introduce a strategic method to sample training data, where pairs of items are heterogeneous dyads, i.e., the two elements of a pair belong to different high-level categories. While this approach is applicable to a wide variety of settings, we focus on the representative problem of learning compatible clothing style. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is capable of learning semantic information about visual style and is able to generate outfits of clothes, with items from different categories, that go well together."

It allows for the creation of new visual content that respects the integrity of traditional art forms, enabling artists to remix and innovate without requiring advanced skills. This research could lead to advancements in image processing techniques, enhancing tools for digital artists and potentially influencing future research in style transfer and image harmonization. By addressing this question, we can expand the capabilities of automated systems in creative fields, leading to practical applications in art restoration, digital content creation, and augmented reality.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge lies in the complexity of accurately replicating the unique characteristics of various painting styles while ensuring that the integrated object appears natural within the artwork. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate textures, colors, and brushwork that define a painting's style. Technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated algorithms that can analyze and adapt to different artistic styles, as well as the requirement for high-quality training data that captures the nuances of both photographs and paintings. Theoretical challenges also arise in understanding how to effectively transfer style without losing the integrity of the original image.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on photographic compositing, leaving a gap in techniques specifically designed for paintings. Existing solutions often rely on algorithms that do not translate well to the unique characteristics of painted images, leading to subpar results. Barriers include a lack of dedicated datasets for training models on painting styles and insufficient methodologies that can adapt to the diverse range of artistic expressions. Our approach differs by employing a two-pass algorithm that specifically targets the nuances of painting styles, utilizing neural response statistics to ensure consistency and fidelity in the final composite.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nOur proposed methodology involves a two-pass algorithm: the first pass transfers the overall style of the painting to the input object, while the second pass refines the result to match the painting's color and texture accurately. We will use a dataset comprising various paintings and photographs to train our model, focusing on metrics such as visual coherence and user preference in composite images.

However, compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models, the research on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its infancy stage. Existing GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling specific GAN architectures and losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML in deep compression, we introduce AutoML to GAN compression and develop an AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting with a specifically designed efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end discovery for new efficient generators, given the target computational resource constraints. The search is guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation, therefore fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e., needing no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models. We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super resolution. Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet more competitive compressed models, that largely outperform existing alternatives.

In this work, we step outside the computer vision domain by leveraging the language modeling task, which is the core of natural language processing (NLP). Our main contribution is as follows: we have provided search space of recurrent neural networks on the text datasets and trained 14k architectures within it; we have conducted both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the trained models using datasets for semantic relatedness and language understanding evaluation; finally, we have tested several NAS algorithms to demonstrate how the precomputed results can be utilized. We consider that the benchmark will provide more reliable empirical findings in the community and stimulate progress in developing new NAS methods well suited for recurrent architectures."

There has been a diverse set of behavior modeling and interaction exploration methods in the literature.

In this work, we introduce AMER, namely Automatic behavior Modeling and interaction Exploration in Recommender systems with Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The core contributions of AMER include the three-stage search space and the tailored three-step searching pipeline. In the first step, AMER searches for residual blocks that incorporate commonly used operations in the block-wise search space of stage 1 to model sequential patterns in user behavior. In the second step, it progressively investigates useful low-order and high-order feature interactions in the non-sequential interaction space of stage 2. Finally, an aggregation multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with shortcut connection is selected from flexible dimension settings of stage~3 to combine features extracted from the previous steps. For efficient and effective NAS, AMER employs the one-shot random search in all three steps. Further analysis reveals that AMER's search space could cover most of the representative behavior extraction and interaction investigation methods, which demonstrates the universality of our design. The extensive experimental results over various scenarios reveal that AMER could outperform competitive baselines with elaborate feature engineering and architecture engineering, indicating both effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."

As its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, the accurate and fast detection of the COVID-19 infection is crucial. Although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans, there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques. In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1-score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%). We further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance. At last, we design an automated deep learning methodology to generate a lightweight deep learning model MNas3DNet41 that achieves an accuracy of 87.14%, F1-score of 87.25%, and AUC of 0.957, which are on par with the best models made by AI experts.

The dimensions of different feature embeddings are often set to a same value empirically, which limits the predictive performance of latent factor models. Existing works have proposed heuristic or reinforcement learning-based methods to search for mixed feature embedding dimensions. For efficiency concern, these methods typically choose embedding dimensions from a restricted set of candidate dimensions. However, this restriction will hurt the flexibility of dimension selection, leading to suboptimal performance of search results. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Neural Input Search (DNIS), a method that searches for mixed feature embedding dimensions in a more flexible space through continuous relaxation and differentiable optimization. The key idea is to introduce a soft selection layer that controls the significance of each embedding dimension, and optimize this layer according to model's validation performance. DNIS is model-agnostic and thus can be seamlessly incorporated with existing latent factor models for recommendation. We conduct experiments with various architectures of latent factor models on three public real-world datasets for rating prediction, Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction, and top-k item recommendation. The results demonstrate that our method achieves the best predictive performance compared with existing neural input search approaches with fewer embedding parameters and less time cost."

Instead, motivated by recent results linking training speed and generalisation with stochastic gradient descent, we propose to estimate the final test performance based on the sum of training losses. Our estimator is inspired by the marginal likelihood, which is used for Bayesian model selection. Our model-free estimator is simple, efficient, and cheap to implement, and does not require hyperparameter-tuning or surrogate training before deployment. We demonstrate empirically that our estimator consistently outperforms other baselines and can achieve a rank correlation of 0.95 with final test accuracy on the NAS-Bench201 dataset within 50 epochs."

Standard hyperparameter optimization methods are expensive because of their multi-trial nature: different configurations are tried separately to find the best. In this paper, we propose AutoHAS, an efficient framework for both hyperparameter and architecture search. AutoHAS generalizes the concept of efficient architecture search, ENAS and DARTS, to hyperparameter search and hence can jointly optimize both in a single training. A key challenge in such generalization is that ENAS and DARTS are designed to optimize discrete architecture choices, whereas hyperparameter choices are often continuous. To tackle this challenge, we discretize the continuous space into a linear combination of multiple categorical basis. Furthermore, we extend the idea of weight sharing and augment it with REINFORCE to reduce its memory cost. In order to decouple the shared network weights and controller optimization, we also propose to create temporary weights for evaluating the sampled hyperparameters and updating the controller. Experimental results show AutoHAS can improve the ImageNet accuracy by up to 0.8% for highly-optimized state-of-the-art ResNet/EfficientNet models, and up to 11% for less-optimized models. Compared to random search and Bayesian search, AutoHAS consistently achieves better accuracy with 10x less computation cost."

Therefore, an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have begun to classify existing work mainly based on the key components of NAS: search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. While this classification method is more intuitive, it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work involved. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: beginning with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then providing solutions for subsequent related research work.

Evolutionary deep learning (EDL) is able to automatically design the best CNN architectures without much expertise. However, the existing EDL algorithms generally evaluate the fitness of a new architecture by training from scratch, resulting in the prohibitive computational cost even operated on high-performance computers. In this paper, an end-to-end offline performance predictor based on the random forest is proposed to accelerate the fitness evaluation in EDL. The proposed performance predictor shows the promising performance in term of the classification accuracy and the consumed computational resources when compared with 18 state-of-the-art peer competitors by integrating into an existing EDL algorithm as a case study.

A good augmentation produces an augmented dataset that adds variability while retaining the statistical properties of the original dataset. Some techniques, such as AutoAugment and Fast AutoAugment, have introduced a search phase to find a set of suitable augmentation policies for a given model and dataset. This comes at the cost of great computational overhead, adding up to several thousand GPU hours. More recently RandAugment was proposed to substantially speedup the search phase by approximating the search space by a couple of hyperparameters, but still incurring non-negligible cost for tuning those. In this paper we show that, under the assumption that the augmentation space is approximately distribution invariant, a uniform sampling over the continuous space of augmentation transformations is sufficient to train highly effective models. Based on that result we propose UniformAugment, an automated data augmentation approach that completely avoids a search phase. In addition to discussing the theoretical underpinning supporting our approach, we also use the standard datasets, as well as established models for image classification, to show that UniformAugment's effectiveness is comparable to the aforementioned methods, while still being highly efficient by virtue of not requiring any search."

It is shown that even when using a simple first-order method on the mixed-level formulation, MiLeNAS can achieve a lower validation error for NAS problems. Consequently, architectures obtained by our method achieve consistently higher accuracies than those obtained from bilevel optimization. Moreover, MiLeNAS proposes a framework beyond DARTS.

Current methods mainly hold the assumption that a supernet should give a reasonable ranking over all paths. They thus treat all paths equally, and spare much effort to train paths. However, it is harsh for a single supernet to evaluate accurately on such a huge-scale search space (e.g., 7^21). In this paper, instead of covering all paths, we ease the burden of supernet by encouraging it to focus more on evaluation of those potentially-good ones, which are identified using a surrogate portion of validation data. Concretely, during training, we propose a multi-path sampling strategy with rejection, and greedily filter the weak paths. The training efficiency is thus boosted since the training space has been greedily shrunk from all paths to those potentially-good ones. Moreover, we further adopt an exploration and exploitation policy by introducing an empirical candidate path pool. Our proposed method GreedyNAS is easy-to-follow, and experimental results on ImageNet dataset indicate that it can achieve better Top-1 accuracy under same search space and FLOPs or latency level, but with only ~60% of supernet training cost.

These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging.

Specifically, SemiNAS 1) trains an initial accuracy predictor with a small set of architecture-accuracy data pairs; 2) uses the trained accuracy predictor to predict the accuracy of large amount of architectures (without evaluation); and 3) adds the generated data pairs to the original data to further improve the predictor. The trained accuracy predictor can be applied to various NAS algorithms by predicting the accuracy of candidate architectures for them. SemiNAS has two advantages: 1) It reduces the computational cost under the same accuracy guarantee. On NASBench-101 benchmark dataset, it achieves comparable accuracy with gradient-based method while using only 1/7 architecture-accuracy pairs. 2) It achieves higher accuracy under the same computational cost. It achieves 94.02% test accuracy on NASBench-101, outperforming all the baselines when using the same number of architectures. On ImageNet, it achieves 23.5% top-1 error rate (under 600M FLOPS constraint) using 4 GPU-days for search. We further apply it to LJSpeech text to speech task and it achieves 97% intelligibility rate in the low-resource setting and 15% test error rate in the robustness setting, with 9%, 7% improvements over the baseline respectively."

We argue that given a computer vision task for which a NAS method is expected, this definition can reduce the vaguely-defined NAS evaluation to i) accuracy of this task and ii) the total computation consumed to finally obtain a model with satisfying accuracy. Seeing that most existing methods do not solve this problem directly, we propose DSNAS, an efficient differentiable NAS framework that simultaneously optimizes architecture and parameters with a low-biased Monte Carlo estimate. Child networks derived from DSNAS can be deployed directly without parameter retraining. Comparing with two-stage methods, DSNAS successfully discovers networks with comparable accuracy (74.4\\%) on ImageNet in 420 GPU hours, reducing the total time by more than 34\\%."

In most real-world situations, the class labels provided in the training data would be noisy due to many reasons, such as subjective judgments, inadequate information, and random human errors. Existing work has demonstrated the adverse effects of label noise on the learning of weights of neural networks. These effects could become more critical in NAS since the architectures are not only trained with noisy labels but are also compared based on their performances on noisy validation sets. In this paper, we systematically explore the robustness of NAS under label noise. We show that label noise in the training and/or validation data can lead to various degrees of performance variations. Through empirical experiments, using robust loss functions can mitigate the performance degradation under symmetric label noise as well as under a simple model of class conditional label noise. We also provide a theoretical justification for this. Both empirical and theoretical results provide a strong argument in favor of employing the robust loss function in NAS under high-level noise."

However, performance gains can be achieved by designing network architectures specifically for detection and segmentation, as shown by recent neural architecture search (NAS) research for detection and segmentation. One major challenge though, is that ImageNet pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the searched networks incurs huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fast Neural Network Adaptation (FNA) method, which can adapt both the architecture and parameters of a seed network (e.g. a high performing manually designed backbone) to become a network with different depth, width, or kernels via a Parameter Remapping technique, making it possible to utilize NAS for detection/segmentation tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we conduct FNA on MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for both segmentation and detection that clearly out-perform existing networks designed both manually and by NAS. The total computation cost of FNA is significantly less than SOTA segmentation/detection NAS approaches: 1737$\\times$ less than DPC, 6.8$\\times$ less than Auto-DeepLab and 7.4$\\times$ less than DetNAS.

A variety of algorithms search architectures under different search space. These searched architectures are trained using different setups, e.g., hyper-parameters, data augmentation, regularization. This raises a comparability problem when comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms. NAS-Bench-101 has shown success to alleviate this problem. In this work, we propose an extension to NAS-Bench-101: NAS-Bench-201 with a different search space, results on multiple datasets, and more diagnostic information. NAS-Bench-201 has a fixed search space and provides a unified benchmark for almost any up-to-date NAS algorithms. The design of our search space is inspired by the one used in the most popular cell-based searching algorithms, where a cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph. Each edge here is associated with an operation selected from a predefined operation set. For it to be applicable for all NAS algorithms, the search space defined in NAS-Bench-201 includes all possible architectures generated by 4 nodes and 5 associated operation options, which results in 15,625 neural cell candidates in total. The training log using the same setup and the performance for each architecture candidate are provided for three datasets. This allows researchers to avoid unnecessary repetitive training for selected architecture and focus solely on the search algorithm itself. The training time saved for every architecture also largely improves the efficiency of most NAS algorithms and presents a more computational cost friendly NAS community for a broader range of researchers. We provide additional diagnostic information such as fine-grained loss and accuracy, which can give inspirations to new designs of NAS algorithms. In further support of the proposed NAS-Bench-102, we have analyzed it from many aspects and benchmarked 10 recent NAS algorithms, which verify its applicability."

Despite many great works leading to substantial improvements on a variety of tasks, comparison between different methods is still very much an open issue. While most algorithms are tested on the same datasets, there is no shared experimental protocol followed by all. As such, and due to the under-use of ablation studies, there is a lack of clarity regarding why certain methods are more effective than others. Our first contribution is a benchmark of 8 NAS methods on 5 datasets. To overcome the hurdle of comparing methods with different search spaces, we propose using a method’s relative improvement over the randomly sampled average architecture, which effectively removes advantages arising from expertly engineered search spaces or training protocols. Surprisingly, we find that many NAS techniques struggle to significantly beat the average architecture baseline. We perform further experiments with the commonly used DARTS search space in order to understand the contribution of each component in the NAS pipeline. These experiments highlight that: (i) the use of tricks in the evaluation protocol has a predominant impact on the reported performance of architectures; (ii) the cell-based search space has a very narrow accuracy range, such that the seed has a considerable impact on architecture rankings; (iii) the hand-designed macrostructure (cells) is more important than the searched micro-structure (operations); and (iv) the depth-gap is a real phenomenon, evidenced by the change in rankings between 8 and 20 cell architectures. To conclude, we suggest best practices, that we hope will prove useful for the community and help mitigate current NAS pitfalls, e.g. difficulties in reproducibility and comparison of search methods.

Recently, human-designed data augmentation has been gradually replaced by automatically learned augmentation policy. Through finding the best policy in well-designed search space of data augmentation, AutoAugment can significantly improve validation accuracy on image classification tasks. However, this approach is not computationally practical for large-scale problems. In this paper, we develop an adversarial method to arrive at a computationally-affordable solution called Adversarial AutoAugment, which can simultaneously optimize target related object and augmentation policy search loss. The augmentation policy network attempts to increase the training loss of a target network through generating adversarial augmentation policies, while the target network can learn more robust features from harder examples to improve the generalization. In contrast to prior work, we reuse the computation in target network training for policy evaluation, and dispense with the retraining of the target network. Compared to AutoAugment, this leads to about 12x reduction in computing cost and 11x shortening in time overhead on ImageNet. We show experimental results of our approach on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art. On CIFAR-10, we achieve a top-1 test error of 1.36%, which is the currently best performing single model.

Besides, deep learning models trained with large-scale datasets have shown their superior performance in many stereo vision tasks. However, existing stereo datasets rarely contain the high-quality surface normal and disparity ground truth, which hardly satisfy the demand of training a prospective deep model for indoor scenes. To this end, we introduce a large-scale synthetic indoor robotics stereo (IRS) dataset with over 100K stereo RGB images and high-quality surface normal and disparity maps. Leveraging the advanced rendering techniques of our customized rendering engine, the dataset is considerably close to the real-world captured images and covers several visual effects, such as brightness changes, light reflection/transmission, lens flare, vivid shadow, etc. We compare the data distribution of IRS with existing stereo datasets to illustrate the typical visual attributes of indoor scenes. In addition, we present a new deep model DispNormNet to simultaneously infer surface normal and disparity from stereo images. Compared to existing models trained on other datasets, DispNormNet trained with IRS produces much better estimation of surface normal and disparity for indoor scenes."

Existing works focus on transferring the searched architecture from classification task (ImageNet) to the detector backbone, while the rest of the architecture of the detector remains unchanged. However, this pipeline is not task-specific or data-oriented network search which cannot guarantee optimal adaptation to any dataset. Therefore, we propose an architecture search framework named Auto-FPN specifically designed for detection beyond simply searching a classification backbone. Specifically, we propose two auto search modules for detection: Auto-fusion to search a better fusion of the multi-level features; Auto-head to search a better structure for classification and bounding-box(bbox) regression. Instead of searching for one repeatable cell structure, we relax the constraint and allow different cells. The search space of both modules covers many popular designs of detectors and allows efficient gradient-based architecture search with resource constraint (2 days for COCO on 8 GPU cards). Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, BDD, VisualGenome and ADE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, e.g. achieving around 5% improvement than FPN in terms of mAP while requiring around 50% fewer parameters on the searched modules."

In our work, we adapt AutoAugment to automatically discover effective perturbation policies for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as dialogue generation. We start with a pool of atomic operations that apply subtle semantic-preserving perturbations to the source inputs of a dialogue task (e.g., different POS-tag types of stopword dropout, grammatical errors, and paraphrasing). Next, we allow the controller to learn more complex augmentation policies by searching over the space of the various combinations of these atomic operations. Moreover, we also explore conditioning the controller on the source inputs of the target task, since certain strategies may not apply to inputs that do not contain that strategy’s required linguistic features.

We study this failure mode and show that, while DARTS successfully minimizes validation loss, the found solutions generalize poorly when they coincide with high validation loss curvature in the architecture space. We show that by adding one of various types of regularization we can robustify DARTS to find solutions with less curvature and better generalization properties.

First, the large-step exploration in the traditional controller fails to learn the sensitive performance variations with slight architecture modifications in GNNs. Second, the search space is composed of heterogeneous GNNs, which prevents the direct adoption of parameter sharing among them to accelerate the search progress. To tackle the challenges, we propose an automated graph neural networks (AGNN) framework, which aims to find the optimal GNN architecture efficiently. Specifically, a reinforced conservative controller is designed to explore the architecture space with small steps. To accelerate the validation, a novel constrained parameter sharing strategy is presented to regularize the weight transferring among GNNs. It avoids training from scratch and saves the computation time. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that the architecture identified by AGNN achieves the best performance and search efficiency, comparing with existing human-invented models and the traditional search methods."

Conventional approaches either manually design or use neural architecture search (NAS) to find a specialized neural network and train it from scratch for each case, which is computationally prohibitive (causing $CO_2$ emission as much as 5 cars' lifetime) thus unscalable. In this work, we propose to train a once-for-all (OFA) network that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling training and search, to reduce the cost. We can quickly get a specialized sub-network by selecting from the OFA network without additional training. To efficiently train OFA networks, we also propose a novel progressive shrinking algorithm, a generalized pruning method that reduces the model size across many more dimensions than pruning (depth, width, kernel size, and resolution). It can obtain a surprisingly large number of sub-networks ($> 10^{19}$) that can fit different hardware platforms and latency constraints while maintaining the same level of accuracy as training independently. On diverse edge devices, OFA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) NAS methods (up to 4.0% ImageNet top1 accuracy improvement over MobileNetV3, or same accuracy but 1.5x faster than MobileNetV3, 2.6x faster than EfficientNet w.r.t measured latency) while reducing many orders of magnitude GPU hours and $CO_2$ emission. In particular, OFA achieves a new SOTA 80.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the mobile setting ($<$600M MACs). OFA is the winning solution for the 3rd Low Power Computer Vision Challenge (LPCVC), DSP classification track and the 4th LPCVC, both classification track and detection track.

To alleviate this limitation, in this paper, we propose a derivative-free optimization framework for AutoML using multi-fidelity evaluations. It uses many lowfidelity evaluations on small data subsets and very few highfidelity evaluations on the full dataset. However, the lowfidelity evaluations can be badly biased, and need to be corrected with only a very low cost. We thus propose the Transfer Series Expansion (TSE) that learns the low-fidelity correction predictor efficiently by linearly combining a set of base predictors. The base predictors can be obtained cheaply from down-scaled and experienced tasks. Experimental results on real-world AutoML problems verify that the proposed framework can accelerate derivative-free configuration search significantly by making use of the multi-fidelity evaluations."

In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We solve it by introducing edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we prove that their biased evaluation is due to inherent unfairness in the supernet training. In view of this, we propose two levels of constraints: expectation fairness and strict fairness. Particularly, strict fairness ensures equal optimization opportunities for all choice blocks throughout the training, which neither overestimates nor underestimates their capacity. We demonstrate that this is crucial for improving the confidence of models’ ranking.

Recently, many defences have been proposed, but none have improved the robustness of neural networks consistently. Here, we propose to use adversarial attacks as a function evaluation to search for neural architectures that can resist such attacks automatically. Experiments on neural architecture search algorithms from the literature show that although accurate, they are not able to find robust architectures. A significant reason for this lies in their limited search space. By creating a novel neural architecture search with options for dense layers to connect with convolution layers and vice-versa as well as the addition of concatenation layers in the search, we were able to evolve an architecture that is inherently accurate on adversarial samples. Interestingly, this inherent robustness of the evolved architecture rivals state-of-the-art defences such as adversarial training while being trained only on the non-adversarial samples. Moreover, the evolved architecture makes use of some peculiar traits which might be useful for developing even more robust ones. Thus, the results here confirm that more robust architectures exist as well as opens up a new realm of feasibilities for the development and exploration of neural networks. \nCode available at this http URL."

To break the structure limitation of the pruned networks, we propose to apply neural architecture search to search directly for a network with flexible channel and layer sizes. The number of the channels/layers is learned by minimizing the loss of the pruned networks. The feature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments (generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the probability distribution.The loss can be back-propagated not only to the network weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune the size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise interpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in the aggregation procedure.

With this survey, we provide a formalism which unifies and categorizes the landscape of existing methods along with a detailed analysis that compares and contrasts the different approaches. We achieve this via a comprehensive discussion of the commonly adopted architecture search spaces and architecture optimization algorithms based on principles of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms along with approaches that incorporate surrogate and one-shot models. Additionally, we address the new research directions which include constrained and multi-objective architecture search as well as automated data augmentation, optimizer and activation function search."

However, these approaches often report lower accuracy in evaluating the searched architecture or transferring it to another dataset. This is arguably due to the large gap between the architecture depths in search and evaluation scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm which allows the depth of searched architectures to grow gradually during the training procedure. This brings two issues, namely, heavier computational overheads and weaker search stability, which we solve using search space approximation and regularization, respectively. With a significantly reduced search time (~7 hours on a single GPU), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the proxy dataset (CIFAR10 or CIFAR100) and the target dataset (ImageNet).

Hyper-parameter tuning for data cleaning is very different than hyper-parameter tuning for machine learning since the pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures. This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators."

Its usefulness is becoming more and more recognised due to deep neural networks requiring larger amounts of data to train, and because in certain fields, such as biomedical imaging, large amounts of labelled data are difficult to come by or expensive to produce. In biomedical imaging, features specific to this domain need to be addressed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere we present the Augmentor software package for image augmentation. It provides a stochastic, pipeline-based approach to image augmentation with a number of features that are relevant to biomedical imaging, such as z-stack augmentation and randomised elastic distortions. The software has been designed to be highly extensible, meaning an operation that might be specific to a highly specialised task can easily be added to the library, even at runtime. Although it has been designed as a general software library, it has features that are particularly relevant to biomedical imaging and the techniques required for this domain.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nAugmentor is a Python package made available under the terms of the MIT licence. Source code can be found on GitHub under https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor and installation is via the pip package manager*.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nThe GitHub repository contains supplementary information, code examples, and Jupyter notebooks.

First, the relations of the filters are largely ignored. The filters usually work jointly to make an accurate prediction in a collaborative way. Similar filters will have equivalent effects on the network prediction, and the redundant filters can be further pruned. Second, the pruning criterion remains unchanged during training. As the network updated at each iteration, the filter distribution also changes continuously. The pruning criterions should also be adaptively switched. In this paper, we propose Meta Filter Pruning (MFP) to solve the above problems. First, as a complement to the existing p-norm criterion, we introduce a new pruning criterion considering the filter relation via filter distance. Additionally, we build a meta pruning framework for filter pruning, so that our method could adaptively select the most appropriate pruning criterion as the filter distribution changes. Experiments validate our approach on two image classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our MFP reduces more than 50% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.44% top-5 accuracy loss."

It is non-trivial because detection training typically needs ImageNet pre-training while NAS systems require accuracies on the target detection task as supervisory signals. Based on the technique of one-shot supernet, which contains all possible networks in the search space, we propose a framework for backbone search on object detection. We train the supernet under the typical detector training schedule: ImageNet pre-training and detection fine-tuning. Then, the architecture search is performed on the trained supernet, using the detection task as the guidance. This framework makes NAS on backbones very efficient. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of DetNAS on various detectors, for instance, one-stage RetinaNet and the two-stage FPN. We empirically find that networks searched on object detection shows consistent superiority compared to those searched on ImageNet classification.

However, our understanding of how to represent the search space for neural net architectures and how to search that space efficiently are both still in their infancy. \nWe have performed an in-depth analysis to identify limitations in a widely used search space and a recent architecture search method, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). These findings led us to introduce novel network blocks with a more general, balanced, and consistent design; a better-optimized Cosine Power Annealing learning rate schedule; and other improvements. Our resulting sharpDARTS search is 50% faster with a 20-30% relative improvement in final model error on CIFAR-10 when compared to DARTS. Our best single model run has 1.93% (1.98+/-0.07) validation error on CIFAR-10 and 5.5% error (5.8+/-0.3) on the recently released CIFAR-10.1 test set. To our knowledge, both are state of the art for models of similar size. This model also generalizes competitively to ImageNet at 25.1% top-1 (7.8% top-5) error. \nWe found improvements for existing search spaces but does DARTS generalize to new domains? We propose Differentiable Hyperparameter Grid Search and the HyperCuboid search space, which are representations designed to leverage DARTS for more general parameter optimization. Here we find that DARTS fails to generalize when compared against a human's one shot choice of models. We look back to the DARTS and sharpDARTS search spaces to understand why, and an ablation study reveals an unusual generalization gap. We finally propose Max-W regularization to solve this problem, which proves significantly better than the handmade design. Code will be made available."

In this paper, we propose to evaluate the NAS search phase. To this end, we compare the quality of the solutions obtained by NAS search policies with that of random architecture selection. We find that: (i) On average, the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms perform similarly to the random policy; (ii) the widely-used weight sharing strategy degrades the ranking of the NAS candidates to the point of not reflecting their true performance, thus reducing the effectiveness of the search process.

Leveraging these observations, we evaluate both random search with early-stopping and a novel random search with weight-sharing algorithm on two standard NAS benchmarks---PTB and CIFAR-10. Our results show that random search with early-stopping is a competitive NAS baseline, e.g., it performs at least as well as ENAS, a leading NAS method, on both benchmarks. Additionally, random search with weight-sharing outperforms random search with early-stopping, achieving a state-of-the-art NAS result on PTB and a highly competitive result on CIFAR-10. Finally, we explore the existing reproducibility issues of published NAS results. We note the lack of source material needed to exactly reproduce these results, and further discuss the robustness of published results given the various sources of variability in NAS experimental setups.

We develop an optimal solution named merged-gradient wait-free backpropagation (MG-WFBP) and implement it in our open-source deep learning platform B-Caffe.

                    "The BLAST software package for sequence alignment is one of the most fundamental and widely used bioinformatics tools [1] [2]. Given the large population of BLAST users, any improvement in the execution speed of BLAST will bring significant benefits to the bioinformatics community. Some research groups have used GPUs to accelerate the speed of BLAST. E.g., GPU-BLAST uses GPUs to accelerate BLASTP, and it achieves 3 to 4 times of speedup over single-thread CPU based NCBI-BLASTP [3]. GPUs have also been successfully used to accelerate other sequence alignment tools, e.g., [4]. In this poster, we show our design, implementation, optimization, and experimental results of GPU-BLASTN, a GPU-accelerated version of the widely used NCBI-BLASTN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a complete solution for accelerating BLASTN by GPUs. GPU-BLASTN can obtain identical results as NCBI-BLASTN, and its speed on a contemporary Nvidia GTX680 GPU card is about 10 to 20 times faster than the speed of single-thread NCBI-BLASTN running on Xeon E5620. We evaluate GPU-BLASTN by running sequence search experiments against human build 36 and mouse build 36 genome databases that have been masked with WindowMasker. We use six sets of query sequences with different lengths ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands. We compare the results and running time of GPU-BLASTN with those of NCBIBLASTN on both single-thread CPU and multi-thread CPU. The GPU-BLASTN will be open source and freely available to the bioinformatics community.",

                    "Owing to the existence of noticeable concentrated periods of contention and idleness, self-similar traffic can greatly increase packet delay and loss probability and thus reduce system resource utilisation. The development of efficient congestion control mechanisms plays a central role in the improvement of network quality of service (QoS), in particular for real-time multimedia applications. By exploiting the property of scale-invariant burstiness and correlation inherent in self-similar traffic, the authors propose an effective congestion control scheme, named adaptive wavelet and probability-based scheme (AWP), which concurrently operates over multiple time scales. AWP adopts the extended multifractal wavelet model (EMWM) for analysing estimated traffic volume across multiple time scales. Furthermore, a new auto-correction algorithm based on Bayes’ theory for confidence analysis is employed to examine the validity of the predicted information. The analysis results can be used to enhance the adaptability of the prediction algorithm. In particular, the AWP framework can be easily extended to more than two time scales by increasing the level of wavelet transforms, which brings AWP a natural advantage in implementation and scalability. A series of simulation experiments have demonstrated that the proposed AWP scheme is superior to TCP and TFRC as it can greatly improve the QoS of multimedia data transmission while avoiding congestion collapse on the network."

This advancement could democratize access to powerful AI tools, enabling researchers and practitioners from diverse fields to leverage deep learning without extensive expertise. Furthermore, automating architecture design could accelerate the pace of innovation in AI, leading to breakthroughs in applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenges in automating deep learning architecture design stem from the vast search space of possible architectures, which makes it computationally expensive and time-consuming to explore. Naive approaches may fail due to overfitting, underfitting, or simply not discovering optimal configurations because they lack a systematic way to evaluate and refine architectures. Additionally, the complexity of interactions between different components of a neural network adds to the difficulty, requiring sophisticated methods to balance performance, efficiency, and generalization.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on specific architectures or tasks, leading to a lack of generalizable methods for architecture search. Limitations in computational resources and the absence of robust evaluation metrics have also hindered progress. Existing solutions may not adequately address the trade-offs between model complexity and performance, resulting in suboptimal designs. Our approach aims to integrate advanced techniques such as neural architecture search (NAS) and meta-learning to create a more holistic framework that overcomes these barriers and improves upon prior work.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed methodology involves a multi-faceted approach that combines neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to optimize model design. We will utilize benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet for evaluation, focusing on metrics like accuracy, computational efficiency, and model size. The expected outcomes include the identification of novel architectures that outperform existing state-of-the-art models, as well as a framework that can be applied to various tasks beyond image classification, potentially leading to significant advancements in the field of machine learning."

From random at the start of training, the weights of a neural network evolve in such a way as to be able to perform a variety of tasks, like classifying images. Here we study the emergence of structure in the weights by applying methods from topological data analysis. We train simple feedforward neural networks on the MNIST dataset and monitor the evolution of the weights. When initialized to zero, the weights follow trajectories that branch off recurrently, thus generating trees that describe the growth of the effective capacity of each layer. When initialized to tiny random values, the weights evolve smoothly along two-dimensional surfaces. We show that natural coordinates on these learning surfaces correspond to important factors of variation.",
            "introduction": " Introduction Deep artiﬁcial neural networks perform spectacularly on many machine learning tasks, including image classiﬁcation, speech recognition, translation, and game playing. A neural network can for example be trained to detect the presence of a dog in an image by analyzing a large number of images that have been labeled as “dog” or “no dog,” each time adjusting its parameters, in particular the weights assigned to edges connecting pairs of neurons. Such a neural network is generally organized in layers that learn increasingly abstract features, from simple combinations of input pixels all the way to full-ﬂedged models of a dog [1]. Despite these empirical successes, neural networks are still poorly understood theoretically. One open question is why they generalize so well to unseen samples, whereas the multitude of their parameters would lead one to expect them to overﬁt the training set [ 2,3]. Finding the answer would make neural networks more interpretable and provide a principled approach to designing their architecture. The main intuition behind this paper is that whatever the structure that arises during training may be, it should be possible to capture it with topology, roughly deﬁned as the mathematical study of qualitative shapes and structures. More speciﬁcally, before starting the training the weights are typically initialized randomly and are therefore structureless. However, as the training progresses the weights learn to adjust towards certain distributions of values, whose structure ultimately encodes the knowledge of the neural network about the task at hand. It is the emergence of such learning structures that we wish to exhibit in this paper. Our approach is to monitor the evolution of the weights during training. For a ﬁxed layer of the neural network, we consider each of its neurons at each training step as a vector of incoming weights. This provides us in the end with a cloud of points in a high-dimensional vector space. We study the shape of this point cloud by applying techniques from topological data analysis [ 4]. This allows us to represent the evolution of the weights as a graph that encodes the topological structure of the point cloud. The code for this paper uses the Keras library [5] and is available as a Jupyter Notebook [6]. Preprint. Work in progress.arXiv:1902.08160v4  [cs.LG]  27 Oct 2020This work was originally motivated by the papers [ 7,8], where topological results, see the companion notebook [ 6]). For simplicity we turn off all biases and only consider weights as parameters. We take sigmoid activation functions for the internal layers, and softmax for the output layer, with the cross-entropy as the loss function. Initializing all the weights of a neural network to the same value is generally not recommended in practice [ 13]. One of the main guidelines for initialization is indeed to break the symmetry between the weights, so that the neurons can learn different functions. However, since our goal in this paper is not to reach optimal performance but rather to gain some insight into how weights learn, we start by studying the simplest case where all weights are initialized to zero. We ﬁnd that the evolution of the weights during training describes a tree, with subsets of weights occasionally branching off from each other. While this can already be deduced from inspection of the",

We also demonstrate the change of the simple structures over the course of training. In particular, we define and analyze the spaces of spatial filters of convolutional layers and show the recurrence, among all networks, depths, and during training, of a simple circle consisting of rotating edges, as well as a less recurring unanticipated complex circle that combines lines, edges, and non-linear patterns.

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. \nThrough extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. \nWe interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models."

Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

This is so in part because of new experimental methods, and in part because of the increase in the availability of high powered computing technology. It is also clear that the nature of the data we are obtaining is significantly different. For example, it is now often the case that we are given data in the form of very long vectors, where all but a few of the coordinates turn out to be irrelevant to the questions of interest, and further that we don’t necessarily know which coordinates are the interesting ones. A related fact is that the data is often very high-dimensional, which severely restricts our ability to visualize it. The data obtained is also often much noisier than in the past and has more missing information (missing data). This is particularly so in the case of biological data, particularly high throughput data from microarray or other sources. Our ability to analyze this data, both in terms of quantity and the nature of the data, is clearly not keeping pace with the data being produced. In this paper, we will discuss how geometry and topology can be applied to make useful contributions to the analysis of various kinds of data. Geometry and topology are very natural tools to apply in this direction, since geometry can be regarded as the study of distance functions, and what one often works with are distance functions on large finite sets of data. The mathematical formalism which has been developed for incorporating geometric and topological techniques deals with point clouds, i.e. finite sets of points equipped with a distance function. It then adapts tools from the various branches of geometry to the study of point clouds. The point clouds are intended to be thought of as finite samples taken from a geometric object, perhaps with noise. Here are some of the key points which come up when applying these geometric methods to data analysis. • Qualitative information is needed: One important goal of data analysis is to allow the user to obtain knowledge about the data, i.e. to understand how it is organized on a large scale. For example, if we imagine that we are looking at a data set constructed somehow from diabetes patients, it would be important to develop the understanding that there are two types of the disease, namely the juvenile and adult onset forms. Once that is established, one of course wants to develop quantitative methods for distinguishing them, but the first insight about the distinct forms of the disease is key."

Machine-learning systems are used to identify objects in images, transcribe speech into text, match news items, posts or products with users’ interests, and select relevant results of search. Increasingly, these applications make use of a class of techniques called deep learning. Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades, constructing a pattern-recognition or machine-learning system required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor that transformed the raw data (such as the pixel values of an image) into a suitable internal representation or feature vector from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could detect or classify patterns in the input. Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned. For classification tasks, higher layers of representation amplify aspects of the input that are important for discrimination and suppress irrelevant variations. An image, for example, comes in the form of an array of pixel values, and the learned features in the first layer of representation typically represent the presence or absence of edges at particular orientations and locations in the image. The second layer typically detects motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges, regardless of small variations in the edge positions. The third layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to parts of familiar objects, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has turned out to be very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable to many domains of science, business and government. In addition to beating records in image recognition and speech recognition, it has beaten other machine-learning techniques at predicting the activity of potential drug molecules, analysing particle accelerator data, reconstructing brain circuits, and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease. Perhaps more surprisingly, deep learning has produced extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language understanding, particularly topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering and language translation. We think that deep learning will have many more successes in the near future because it requires very little engineering by hand, so it can easily take advantage of increases in the amount of available computation and data. New learning algorithms and architectures that are currently being developed for deep neural networks will only accelerate this progress."

Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks.

                    "The most general AdS$_5 imes Y$ solutions of type IIB string theory that are AdS/CFT dual to superconformal field theories in four dimensions can be fruitfully described in the language of generalized geometry, a powerful hybrid of complex and symplectic geometry. We show that the cone over the compact five-manifold $Y$ is generalized Calabi-Yau and carries a generalized holomorphic Killing vector field $xi$, dual to the R-symmetry. Remarkably, this cone always admits a symplectic structure, which descends to a contact structure on $Y$, with $xi$ as Reeb vector field. Moreover, the contact volumes of $Y$, which can be computed by localization, encode essential properties of the dual CFT, such as the central charge and the conformal dimensions of BPS operators corresponding to wrapped D3-branes. We then define a notion of ``generalized Sasakian geometry'', which can be characterized by a simple differential system of three symplectic forms on a four-dimensional transverse space. The correct Reeb vector field for an AdS$_5$ solution within a given family of generalized Sasakian manifolds can be determined---without the need of the explicit metric---by a variational procedure. The relevant functional to minimize is the type IIB supergravity action restricted to the space of generalized Sasakian manifolds, which turns out to be just the contact volume. We conjecture that this contact volume is equal to the inverse of the trial central charge whose maximization determines the R-symmetry of the dual superconformal field theory. The power of this volume minimization is illustrated by the calculation of the contact volumes for a new infinite family of solutions, in perfect agreement with the results of $a$-maximization in the dual mass-deformed generalized conifold theories.",
                    "We analyse the most general N = 2 supersymmetric solutions of D = 11 supergravity consisting of a warped product of four-dimensional anti-de-Sitter space with a seven-dimensional Riemannian manifold Y7. We show that the necessary and sufficient conditions for supersymmetry can be phrased in terms of a local SU (2)-structure on Y7. Solutions with non-zero M2-brane charge also admit a canonical contact structure, in terms of which many physical quantities can be expressed, including the free energy and the scaling dimensions of operators dual to supersymmetric wrapped M5-branes. We show that a special class of solutions is singled out by imposing an additional symmetry, for which the problem reduces to solving a second order non-linear ODE. As well as recovering a known class of solutions, that includes the IR fixed point of a mass deformation of the ABJM theory, we also find new solutions which are dual to cubic deformations. In particular, we find a new supersymmetric warped AdS4 × S7 solution with non-trivial four-form flux.",
                    ": We study probe M5-branes in N = 1 AdS 5 solutions of M-theory that arise from M5-branes wrapped on a Riemann surface. Using the BPS condition from κ -symmetry, we classify supersymmetric probe M5-branes that extend along all of AdS 5 and intersect the Riemann surface at points. These can be viewed as punctures in the dual N = 1 superconformal ﬁeld theories. We ﬁnd M5-branes that correspond to the two types of simple punctures previously studied in ﬁeld theory. In addition, when the central charge is rational, we ﬁnd a new class of M5-branes with a moduli space that includes two internal dimensions in addition to the Riemann surface. These new M5-branes have the essential characteristic of fractional branes, in that a single one at a generic point of its moduli space becomes multiple M5-branes at special points. M-Theory"

Understanding the generalization capabilities of neural networks could lead to the development of more robust models and inform best practices in model design. This knowledge could also have practical applications in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where reliable predictions are essential.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge lies in the complex interplay between the vast number of parameters in neural networks and their training dynamics. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate structures that emerge during training. Theoretical obstacles include a lack of understanding of how weight distributions evolve and how these distributions relate to the network's performance. Additionally, the high-dimensional nature of the weight space complicates the analysis, making it difficult to capture the qualitative shapes and structures that emerge.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has often focused on empirical performance rather than the underlying mechanisms of weight evolution. There has been a lack of methodologies that effectively combine topological data analysis with neural network training dynamics. Barriers include the complexity of high-dimensional data and the absence of a framework to systematically study the topological structures of weight distributions. This paper's approach differs by explicitly monitoring weight evolution and applying topological analysis to uncover the emergent structures during training.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nThe proposed methodology involves monitoring the evolution of weights in a neural network during training, treating each neuron's incoming weights as a vector in a high-dimensional space. The analysis will utilize topological data analysis techniques to study the shape of the resulting point cloud. The dataset will consist of standard image classification tasks, and the metric for evaluation will focus on the topological features of the weight distributions. The expected outcome is a clearer understanding of how weights learn and evolve, represented as a graph that encodes the topological structure of the point cloud, ultimately revealing insights into the generalization capabilities of neural networks."

Many of these applications first perform feature extraction and then feed the results thereof into a trainable classifier. The mathematical analysis of deep convolutional neural networks for feature extraction was initiated by Mallat, 2012. Specifically, Mallat considered so-called scattering networks based on a wavelet transform followed by the modulus non-linearity in each network layer, and proved translation invariance (asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter) and deformation stability of the corresponding feature extractor. This paper complements Mallat's results by developing a theory that encompasses general convolutional transforms, or in more technical parlance, general semi-discrete frames (including Weyl-Heisenberg filters, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets, wavelets, and learned filters), general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities (e.g., rectified linear units, shifted logistic sigmoids, hyperbolic tangents, and modulus functions), and general Lipschitz-continuous pooling operators emulating, e.g., sub-sampling and averaging. In addition, all of these elements can be different in different network layers. For the resulting feature extractor we prove a translation invariance result of vertical nature in the sense of the features becoming progressively more translation-invariant with increasing network depth, and we establish deformation sensitivity bounds that apply to signal classes such as, e.g., band-limited functions, cartoon functions, and Lipschitz functions.",

Parseval networks are empirically and theoretically motivated by an analysis of the robustness of the predictions made by deep neural networks when their input is subject to an adversarial perturbation. The most important feature of Parseval networks is to maintain weight matrices of linear and convolutional layers to be (approximately) Parseval tight frames, which are extensions of orthogonal matrices to non-square matrices. We describe how these constraints can be maintained efficiently during SGD. We show that Parseval networks match the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and Street View House Numbers (SVHN) while being more robust than their vanilla counterpart against adversarial examples. Incidentally, Parseval networks also tend to train faster and make a better usage of the full capacity of the networks."

                    "abstract": "Many practical machine learning tasks employ very deep convolutional neural networks. Such large depths pose formidable computational challenges in training and operating the network. It is therefore important to understand how fast the energy contained in the propagated signals (a.k.a. feature maps) decays across layers. In addition, it is desirable that the feature extractor generated by the network be informative in the sense of the only signal mapping to the all-zeros feature vector being the zero input signal. This “trivial null-set” property can be accomplished by asking for “energy conservation” in the sense of the energy in the feature vector being proportional to that of the corresponding input signal. This paper establishes conditions for energy conservation (and thus for a trivial null-set) for a wide class of deep convolutional neural network-based feature extractors and characterizes corresponding feature map energy decay rates. Specifically, we consider general scattering networks employing the modulus non-linearity and we find that under mild analyticity and high-pass conditions on the filters (which encompass, inter alia, various constructions of Weyl-Heisenberg filters, wavelets, ridgelets, ( $\\alpha $ )-curvelets, and shearlets) the feature map energy decays at least polynomially fast. For broad families of wavelets and Weyl-Heisenberg filters, the guaranteed decay rate is shown to be exponential. Moreover, we provide handy estimates of the number of layers needed to have at least  $((1-\\varepsilon )\\cdot 100)\\%$  of the input signal energy be contained in the feature vector."

Many signals of practical relevance (such as natural images) exhibit, however, sharp and curved discontinuities and are hence not band-limited. The main contribution of this paper is a deformation stability result that takes these structural properties into account.

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity.

We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

This allows to extract wider classes of features than point singularities resolved by the wavelet transform. Our generalized feature extractor is proven to be translation-invariant, and we develop deformation stability results for a larger class of deformations than those considered by Mallat. For Mallat's wavelet-based feature extractor, we get rid of a number of technical conditions. The mathematical engine behind our results is continuous frame theory, which allows us to completely detach the invariance and deformation stability proofs from the particular algebraic structure of the underlying frames."

A major question for Machine Learning is how to learn such good features automatically. Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are a biologically-inspired trainable architecture that can learn invariant features. Each stage in a ConvNets is composed of a filter bank, some nonlinearities, and feature pooling layers. With multiple stages, a ConvNet can learn multi-level hierarchies of features. While ConvNets have been successfully deployed in many commercial applications from OCR to video surveillance, they require large amounts of labeled training samples. We describe new unsupervised learning algorithms, and new non-linear stages that allow ConvNets to be trained with very few labeled samples.

This yields much better results in wide-baseline situations than the pixel and correlation-based algorithms that are commonly used in narrow-baseline stereo. Also, using a descriptor makes our algorithm robust against many photometric and geometric transformations. Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF, which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance when used densely. It is important to note that our approach is the first algorithm that attempts to estimate dense depth maps from wide-baseline image pairs, and we show that it is a good one at that with many experiments for depth estimation accuracy, occlusion detection, and comparing it against other descriptors on laser-scanned ground truth scenes. We also tested our approach on a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes with different photometric and geometric transformations and our experiments support our claim to being robust against these."

                    "abstract": "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a “better” basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact)."

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (≫ 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

Modulation spectral analysis of every feature value will generate a corresponding modulation spectrum and all the modulation spectra can be collected to form a modulation spectrogram which exhibits the time-varying or rhythmic information of music signals. Each modulation spectrum is then decomposed into several logarithmically-spaced modulation subbands. The modulation spectral contrast (MSC) and modulation spectral valley (MSV) are then computed from each modulation subband. Effective and compact features are generated from statistical aggregations of the MSCs and MSVs of all modulation subbands. An information fusion approach which integrates both feature level fusion method and decision level combination method is employed to improve the classification accuracy. Experiments conducted on two different music datasets have shown that our proposed approach can achieve higher classification accuracy than other approaches with the same experimental setup."

In recent years, “natural” images have become popular in the study of vision and have been used to show apparently impressive progress in building such models. Here, we challenge the use of uncontrolled “natural” images in guiding that progress. In particular, we show that a simple V1-like model—a neuroscientist's “null” model, which should perform poorly at real-world visual object recognition tasks—outperforms state-of-the-art object recognition systems (biologically inspired and otherwise) on a standard, ostensibly natural image recognition test. As a counterpoint, we designed a “simpler” recognition test to better span the real-world variation in object pose, position, and scale, and we show that this test correctly exposes the inadequacy of the V1-like model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tests based on uncontrolled natural images can be seriously misleading, potentially guiding progress in the wrong direction. Instead, we reexamine what it means for images to be natural and argue for a renewed focus on the core problem of object recognition—real-world image variation."

Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples."

The model produces \"stroke detectors\" when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset.

We consider special cases in which the calculation of the frame bounds and synthesis filters is simplified. Finally, simulation results are presented."

Completeness criteria for 2D Gabor image representations are important because of their increasing role in many computer vision applications and also in modeling biological vision, since recent neurophysiological evidence from the visual cortex of mammalian brains suggests that the filter response profiles of the main class of linearly-responding cortical neurons (called simple cells) are best modeled as a family of self-similar 2D Gabor wavelets. We therefore derive the conditions under which a set of continuous 2D Gabor wavelets will provide a complete representation of any image, and we also find self-similar wavelet parametrization which allow stable reconstruction by summation as though the wavelets formed an orthonormal basis. Approximating a \"tight frame\" generates redundancy which allows low-resolution neural responses to represent high-resolution images."

The analysis uses an overcomplete wavelet decomposition, which yields a description that is translation invariant. It is shown that this representation constitutes a tight frame of l(2) and that it has a fast iterative algorithm. A texture is characterized by a set of channel variances estimated at the output of the corresponding filter bank. Classification experiments with l(2) Brodatz textures indicate that the discrete wavelet frame (DWF) approach is superior to a standard (critically sampled) wavelet transform feature extraction. These results also suggest that this approach should perform better than most traditional single resolution techniques (co-occurrences, local linear transform, and the like). A detailed comparison of the classification performance of various orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet transforms is also provided. Finally, the DWF feature extraction technique is incorporated into a simple multicomponent texture segmentation algorithm, and some illustrative examples are presented."

This paper considers the above three properties for subspaces H of L2(ℝd), and for sets X of the form with Φ either a singleton, a finite set, or, more generally, a countable set. The analysis is performed on the Fourier domain, where the two operators TT* and T* T are decomposed into a collection of simpler \"fiber\" operators. The main theme of the entire analysis is the characterization of each of the above three properties in terms of the analogous property of these simpler operators."

A common learning algorithm for radial basis function networks is based on first choosing randomly some data points as radial basis function centers and then using singular-value decomposition to solve for the weights of the network. Such a procedure has several drawbacks, and, in particular, an arbitrary selection of centers is clearly unsatisfactory. The authors propose an alternative learning procedure based on the orthogonal least-squares method. The procedure chooses radial basis function centers one by one in a rational way until an adequate network has been constructed. In the algorithm, each selected center maximizes the increment to the explained variance or energy of the desired output and does not suffer numerical ill-conditioning problems. The orthogonal least-squares learning strategy provides a simple and efficient means for fitting radial basis function networks. This is illustrated using examples taken from two different signal processing applications."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

For each parameter set (based on a mel-frequency cepstrum, a linear frequency cepstrum, a linear prediction cepstrum, a linear prediction spectrum, or a set of reflection coefficients), word templates were generated using an efficient dynamic warping method, and test data were time registered with the templates. A set of ten mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients computed every 6.4 ms resulted in the best performance, namely 96.5 percent and 95.0 percent recognition with each of two speakers. The superior performance of the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients may be attributed to the fact that they better represent the perceptually relevant aspects of the short-term speech spectrum."

En effet, dans leur representation naive, les signaux sont des objets compliques, appartenant a des espaces de grande dimension. Representes differemment, ils peuvent en revanche etre plus faciles a interpreter. Cette these s’interesse a une representation frequemment utilisee dans ce genre de situations, notamment pour analyser des signaux audio : le module de la transformee en ondelettes. Pour mieux comprendre son comportement, nous considerons, d’un point de vue theorique et algorithmique, le probleme inverse correspondant : la reconstruction d’un signal a partir du module de sa transformee en ondelettes. Ce probleme appartient a une classe plus generale de problemes inverses : les problemes de reconstruction de phase. Dans un premier chapitre, nous decrivons un nouvel algorithme, PhaseCut, qui resout numeriquement un probleme de reconstruction de phase generique. Comme l’algorithme similaire PhaseLift, PhaseCut utilise une relaxation convexe, qui se trouve en l’occurence etre de la meme forme que les relaxations du probleme abondamment etudie MaxCut. Nous comparons les performances de PhaseCut et PhaseLift, en termes de precision et de rapidite. Dans les deux chapitres suivants, nous etudions le cas particulier de la reconstruction de phase pour la transformee en ondelettes. Nous montrons que toute fonction sans frequence negative est uniquement determinee (a une phase globale pres) par le module de sa transformee en ondelettes, mais que la reconstruction a partir du module n’est pas stable au bruit, pour une definition forte de la stabilite. On demontre en revanche une propriete de stabilite locale. Nous presentons egalement un nouvel algorithme de reconstruction de phase, non-convexe, qui est specifique a la transformee en ondelettes, et etudions numeriquement ses performances. Enfin, dans les deux derniers chapitres, nous etudions une representation plus sophistiquee, construite a partir du module de transformee en ondelettes : la transformee de scattering. Notre but est de comprendre quelles proprietes d’un signal sont caracterisees par sa transformee de scattering. On commence par demontrer un theoreme majorant l’energie des coefficients de scattering d’un signal, a un ordre donne, en fonction de l’energie du signal initial, convole par un filtre passe-haut qui depend de l’ordre. On etudie ensuite une generalisation de la transformee de scattering, qui s’applique a des processus stationnaires. On montre qu’en dimension finie, cette transformee generalisee preserve la norme. En dimension un, on montre egalement que les coefficients de scattering generalises d’un processus caracterisent la queue de distribution du processus."

The representation elements that we obtain are generated by translations, dilations, and shear transformations of a single mother function, and are called shearlets. The shearlets provide optimally sparse representations for 2-D functions that are smooth away from discontinuities along curves. Another benefit of this approach is that, thanks to their mathematical structure, these systems provide a Multiresolution analysis similar to the one associated with classical wavelets, which is very useful for the development of fast algorithmic implementations."

Also some efficient synthesis techniques are referred to. Furthermore, examples are included to compare various two-channel filter banks with each other. Section 3 concentrates on the design of multi-channel (M-channel) uniform filter banks. The main emphasis is laid on designing these banks using tree-structured filter banks with the aid of two-channel filter banks and on generating the overall bank with the aid of a single prototype filter and a proper cosine-modulation or MDFT technique. In Section 4, it is shown how octave filter banks can be generated using a single two-channel filter bank as the basic building block. Also, the relations between the frequency-selective octave filter banks and discrete-time wavelet banks are briefly discussed. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

It is a set on which a notion of distance between each pair of elements is defined, and in which notions from calculus in R (open and closed intervals, convergent sequences, continuous functions) can be studied. Many of the fundamental types of spaces used in analysis are metric spaces (e.g., Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces), so metric spaces are one of the first abstractions that has to be mastered in order to learn analysis."

In this paper, we pursue a \" true \" two-dimensional transform that can capture the intrinsic geometrical structure that is key in visual information. The main challenge in exploring geometry in images comes from the discrete nature of the data. Thus, unlike other approaches, such as curvelets, that first develop a transform in the continuous domain and then discretize for sampled data, our approach starts with a discrete-domain construction and then studies its convergence to an expansion in the continuous domain. Specifically, we construct a discrete-domain multiresolution and multidirection expansion using non-separable filter banks, in much the same way that wavelets were derived from filter banks. This construction results in a flexible multiresolution, local, and directional image expansion using contour segments, and thus it is named the contourlet transform. The discrete contourlet transform has a fast iterated filter bank algorithm that requires an order N operations for N-pixel images. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between the developed filter bank and the associated continuous-domain contourlet expansion via a directional multiresolution analysis framework. We show that with parabolic scaling and sufficient directional vanishing moments, contourlets achieve the optimal approximation rate for piecewise smooth functions with discontinuities along twice continuously differentiable curves. Finally, we show some numerical experiments demonstrating the potential of contourlets in several image processing applications."

Improved classification methods can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models, leading to better performance in real-world applications like medical imaging, automated surveillance, and audio recognition.

Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to capture the intricate structures and patterns present in high-dimensional data. Technical obstacles include the need for robust algorithms that can efficiently handle the computational demands of shearlet transforms and the integration of these techniques with existing machine learning frameworks. Theoretical challenges also arise in ensuring that the extracted features maintain their discriminative power across various applications.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often focused on traditional wavelet and Fourier transforms, which may not adequately address the unique characteristics of multivariate data. Limitations in computational resources and the lack of effective algorithms for shearlet transforms have hindered progress. Additionally, many existing solutions do not leverage the full potential of multiscale analysis in conjunction with modern machine learning techniques. My approach aims to bridge this gap by developing novel algorithms that integrate shearlet-based feature extraction with state-of-the-art machine learning models, thus enhancing classification performance.\n\n### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nMy proposed methodology involves the following key components: \n1. **Method**: Implementing shearlet transforms for feature extraction from multivariate datasets, followed by the application of machine learning classifiers (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks).\n2. **Dataset**: Utilizing benchmark datasets from audio and image domains that require complex feature extraction for classification tasks.\n3. **Metric**: Evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of the shearlet-based features compared to traditional methods.\n"
