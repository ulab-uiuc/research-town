I have made significant contributions to object detection, shape-from-shading, video to depth estimation, navigation in virtual environments, automated theorem proving, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).\n\nIn my work on object detection, I proposed CornerNet, a novel approach that detects objects as paired keypoints, the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, using a single convolution neural network. This eliminates the need for designing a set of anchor boxes and achieves a 42.2% AP on MS COCO, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors.\n\nIn the area of shape-from-shading, I introduced an approach that trains deep networks with synthetic images, without the need for any external shape dataset to render synthetic images. The approach consists of two synergistic processes: the evolution of complex shapes from simple primitives, and the training of a deep network for shape-from-shading. The evolution generates better shapes guided by the network training, while the training improves by using the evolved shapes.\n\nI also worked on DeepV2D, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for predicting depth from video. DeepV2D combines the representation ability of neural networks with the geometric principles governing image formation. I composed a collection of classical geometric algorithms, which are converted into trainable modules and combined into an end-to-end differentiable architecture.\n\nIn the field of navigation in virtual environments, I compared learning-based methods and classical methods and constructed classical navigation agents that outperform state-of-the-art learning-based agents on two standard benchmarks. I performed detailed analysis to study the strengths and weaknesses of learned agents and classical agents, as well as how characteristics of the virtual environment impact navigation performance.\n\nI also considered the task of automated theorem proving, a key AI task. I proposed to learn a neural generator that automatically synthesizes theorems and proofs for the purpose of training a theorem prover. Experiments on real-world tasks demonstrated that synthetic data from my approach improves the theorem prover and advances the state of the art of automated theorem proving in Metamath.\n\nIn the area of SLAM, I introduced DROID-SLAM,",

I have also explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition, specifically under the constraint of a limited time budget.\n\nMore recently, I have investigated Group Normalization (GN) as an alternative to Batch Normalization (BN) for deep learning. GN divides the channels into groups and computes the mean and variance for normalization within each group, resulting in computation that is independent of batch sizes and stable accuracy across a wide range of batch sizes. I have shown that GN can outperform BN and other normalization variants in object detection, segmentation, and video classification tasks.\n\nI have also explored the use of Siamese networks for unsupervised visual representation learning, specifically the role of negative sample pairs, large batches, and momentum encoders in preventing collapsing solutions. I have proposed a simple Siamese network that achieves competitive results on ImageNet and downstream tasks using a stop-gradient operation to prevent collapsing.\n\nIn addition, I have revisited the \"dataset classification\" experiment from a decade ago and observed that modern neural networks can achieve excellent accuracy in classifying which dataset an image is from, indicating that these networks may be learning semantic features that are generalizable and transferable.\n\nI have also proposed a method for joint object and stuff segmentation that exploits shape information via masking convolutional features, resulting in state-of-the-art results on benchmarks of PASCAL VOC and new PASCAL-CONTEXT with a compelling computational speed.\n\nFurthermore, I have worked on accelerating the test-time computation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially very deep CNNs, by taking nonlinear units into account and developing an effective solution to the resulting nonlinear optimization problem without the need for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This method achieves a whole-model speedup of 4x with merely a 0.3% increase in top-5 error for the widely used very deep VGG-16 model.\n\nOverall, my research focuses on developing and",

This method trains the VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN and is 213x faster at test-time, while also achieving higher mean average precision (mAP) on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.\n\nIn my \"Low-shot Visual Recognition\" persona, I presented a benchmark for low-shot learning on complex images and proposed techniques for representation regularization and data augmentation to improve the effectiveness of convolutional networks in this setting. These methods improved the one-shot accuracy on novel classes by 2.3x on the ImageNet dataset.\n\nIn my \"Deformable Part Models are Convolutional Neural Networks\" persona, I showed that a deformable part model (DPM) can be formulated as a convolutional neural network (CNN), providing a novel synthesis of the two ideas. This construction, which I call DeepPyramid DPM, significantly outperforms DPMs based on histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and slightly outperforms a comparable version of the R-CNN detection system, while running an order of magnitude faster.\n\nI am also interested in developing datasets to drive progress in the field of computer vision. In my \"LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation\" persona, I introduced a new dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation, which contains ~2 million high-quality instance segmentation masks for over 1000 entry-level object categories in 164k images.

This approach allows for interpretable manipulation of the latent feature space at test time, enabling applications such as animating trajectories from a single image.\n\nI have also developed a method for converting a still image into a realistic animated looping video, targeting scenes with continuous fluid motion such as flowing water and billowing smoke. This method uses an image-to-image translation network to encode motion priors of natural scenes and a deep warping technique to animate pixels.\n\nIn the area of depth estimation, I have presented an algorithm for reconstructing dense, geometrically consistent depth for all pixels in a monocular video. This algorithm uses a learning-based prior in the form of a convolutional neural network trained for single-image depth estimation, fine-tuned to satisfy geometric constraints of a particular input video.\n\nMy work on reducing drift in structure from motion involves using extended structural features such as planes and vanishing points to establish long-range constraints on the scale and shape of the reconstruction. This method enables the reconstruction of particularly drift-prone sequences such as long, low field-of-view videos without inertial measurements.\n\nIn the field of lighting estimation, I have proposed a physically-based approach to model accidental light probes (ALPs) and estimate lighting from their appearances in single images. This approach models the appearance of ALPs by photogrammetrically principled shading and inverts this process via differentiable rendering to recover incidental illumination.\n\nFinally, I have presented a method for reconstructing high-quality meshes of large unbounded real-world scenes suitable for photorealistic novel view synthesis.

I have conducted experiments to compare the response of human subjects to the generated art with their response to art created by artists, and the results show that human subjects could not distinguish art generated by the proposed system from art generated by contemporary artists and shown in top art fairs.\n\nIn addition, I have proposed a computational approach for analysis of strokes in line drawings by artists, which facilitates attribution of drawings of unknown authors in a way that is not easy to be deceived by forged art. I have also developed an AI methodology that quantifies the characteristics of individual strokes in drawings using a novel algorithm for segmenting individual strokes and proposing different hand-crafted and learned features for the task of quantifying stroke characteristics.\n\nFurthermore, I have worked on a proximity-preserving distance correlation maximization algorithm, which reduces the dimensionality of the features while simultaneously maximizing a statistical measure of dependence known as distance correlation between the low-dimensional features and a response variable. This helps in solving the prediction problem with a low-dimensional set of features.\n\nI am also interested in Visual-Semantic Scene Understanding by Sharing Labels in a Context Network, which considers the problem of naming objects in complex, natural scenes containing widely varying object appearance and subtly different names.
