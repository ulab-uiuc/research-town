In my recent work, I have been exploring various approaches to enhance the accuracy and usability of eye tracking systems, natural interaction analysis, privacy-aware gaze interfaces, and off-screen mobile input.\n\nIn the SacCalib project, I proposed a novel method to reduce calibration distortion in stationary eye trackers using saccadic eye movements. This non-intrusive solution exploits the curving effect of calibration distortion on straight saccade trajectories, undistorting the gaze projection plane and improving the overall accuracy of eye trackers during long-term use.\n\nIn the Detecting Low Rapport project, I investigated the automatic prediction of low rapport during natural interactions within small groups using non-verbal behavior analysis. By analyzing facial expressions, hand motion, gaze, speaker turns, and speech prosody, I was able to detect low rapport with an average precision of 0.7, demonstrating the potential for early prediction and intervention in social dynamics.\n\nPrivacy-aware eye tracking using differential privacy is another area of focus for me. I conducted a large-scale online survey to understand users' willingness to share gaze data and designed a privacy-aware VR interface using differential privacy. This interface prevents user re-identification and protects gender information while maintaining high performance for gaze-based document type classification.\n\nIn the TapNet project, I developed a multi-task learning CNN for off-screen mobile input using built-in IMU sensors on mobile phones. TapNet can detect tapping on smartphones with high accuracy, recognizing multiple tap properties and establishing a new technical foundation for off-screen mobile input.\n\nLastly, I presented Rambler, an LLM-powered graphical user interface that supports gist-level manipulation of dictated text for efficient writing on mobile devices. Rambler's gist extraction and macro revision functions facilitate iterative revisions and user control over the content, improving the quality of spoken text and supporting diverse user strategies.\n\nIn summary, my research aims to improve human-computer interaction by developing innovative methods and technologies in eye tracking, natural interaction analysis, privacy-aware gaze interfaces, and off-screen mobile input.

In my work, I strive to take a web-scale, cross-community approach in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the online cultural ecosystem.\n\nIn one of my studies, I performed a web-scale analysis of the origins of image memes, which are cultural artifacts that often originate in peripheral communities and then diffuse to the mainstream core. However, my research found that communities at the core of the network are actually the ones that originate the most highly diffused image memes. The top 10% of communities by network centrality originate the memes that generate 62% of the image meme diffusion events on the web. This challenges the notion that cultural innovations originate in the periphery and highlights the importance of engaging in web-scale, cross-community analyses.\n\nIn another line of research, I studied the issue of low-quality work and unfair rejections on paid crowdsourcing platforms. I found that these problems are often caused by inflated reputation scores, which make high-quality work and workers difficult to find. These inflated scores stem from social pressure to avoid giving negative feedback. To address this issue, I introduced Boomerang, a reputation system for crowdsourcing that elicits more accurate feedback by rebounding the consequences of feedback directly back onto the person who gave it. Field experiments have shown that Boomerang causes both workers and requesters to provide feedback that is more closely aligned with their private opinions.\n\nOverall, my research is focused on using web-scale, cross-community analyses to gain a deeper understanding of online communities and the cultural artifacts that are shared within them.

Many recent algorithms for approximate model counting rely on a reduction to combinatorial searches over random subsets of the space defined by parity or XOR constraints. I have provided matching necessary and sufficient conditions on the required asymptotic length of the parity constraints, and have developed a new family of lower bounds and the first non-trivial upper bounds on the model count that are valid for arbitrarily short XORs.

Stevanovic at the Conference on Applications of Graph Spectra in Computer Science in 2012, regarding which graphs have the zero as the largest eigenvalue of their modularity matrix. I have proven that only complete and complete multipartite graphs have this property and have also shown that both the modularity and the normalized modularity matrix of a graph is negative semidefinite if and only if the graph is complete or complete multipartite.\n\nIn the area of stochastic convex optimization, I have shown that completely asynchronous stochastic gradient procedures achieve optimal (even to constant factors) convergence rates for the solution of convex optimization problems under nearly the same conditions required for asymptotic optimality of standard stochastic gradient procedures.

I provided strong baselines, including different architectures and evaluation of changes in performance across epochs, and replicated the RoBERTa baseline to observe the training robustness to hyperparameter selection and replicability.\n\nI have also delved into the issue of catastrophic interference (CI) in neural networks, which contrasts with humans' ability to sequentially learn new tasks without forgetting previous ones. By simulating naturalistic learning environments, I evaluated the extent of mitigation of CI when training simple rehearsal-based methods in power-law environments similar to those humans face. My results showed that performance was comparable or superior to that of models trained using popular regularization methods and rehearsals in non-power-law environments.\n\nIn addition, I have studied how well deep learning models capture human concepts, specifically focusing on the typicality effect, which is the finding that people judge some instances of a category to be more typical than others. I evaluated language and vision models across a broader range of architectures and concepts, finding that combined language and vision models better predict human typicality data than models of either modality alone.\n\nFrom a behavioral perspective, I have investigated how Large Language Models (LLMs) capture the magnitudes of numbers, revealing surprisingly human-like representations across language models of different architectures. I have also explored the processing of garden-path sentences and the fate of lingering misinterpretations in four large language models, finding promising alignment between humans and LLMs in the processing of garden-path sentences, especially when extra-syntactic information is available to guide processing.\n\nRecently, I have been working on leveraging large language models to provide contextualized and multi-level feedback to empower peer counselors, especially novices, at scale. I co-designed a multi-level feedback taxonomy with senior psychotherapy supervisors, constructed a publicly available dataset with comprehensive feedback annotations, and designed a self",

    "bio": " I am a researcher with a focus on web-scale analysis, crowdsourcing, and online communities. My work involves analyzing large-scale data from various online platforms to understand the origins and diffusion of cultural artifacts, such as image memes. In a recent study, I conducted a web-scale analysis of the origins of image memes and found that communities at the core of the network are the ones that originate the most highly diffused image memes.\n\nIn addition to my work on image memes, I have also explored the use of crowdsourcing for data collection, particularly during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. I led a team that gathered partial county-level data on non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in response to the pandemic in the United States using both volunteer and paid crowdsourcing.\n\nI am also interested in real-time crowdsourcing and have used queueing theory to analyze the retainer model for real-time crowdsourcing. I have developed an algorithm that allows requesters to minimize their cost subject to performance requirements and have proposed and analyzed techniques to improve performance.\n\nI have also worked on designing online field experiments and have introduced a language for online field experiments called PlanOut. This language separates experimental design from application code, allowing the experimenter to concisely describe experimental designs.\n\nIn the area of online creative communities, I have proposed an online community where sharing process, rather than showcasing outcomes, is the main method of sharing creative work. I have presented Mosaic, an online community where illustrators share work-in-progress snapshots showing how an artwork was completed from start to finish.\n\nI am committed to ensuring that AI research is conducted ethically and have developed the Ethics and Society Review board (ESR), a feedback panel that works with researchers to mitigate negative ethical and societal aspects of AI research. The ESR serves as a requirement for funding and has been successful in identifying issues such as harms to minority groups, inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the research plan, dual use, and representation in data.\n\nFinally, I have explored long-term crowd worker quality in the context of microtask crowdsourcing. I have found that workers are extremely stable in their quality over long periods of time and have demonstrated that it is possible to predict workers' long-term quality using just a glimpse of their quality on the first five tasks.",

I am passionate about finding ways to make technology, such as email, more dynamic and user-friendly. In my work, I strive to bring together insights from communication literature and human-computer interaction (HCI) to create practical solutions that benefit both individuals and society as a whole.\n\nIn my recent position paper, I introduced the concept of \"Public(s)-in-the-Loop,\" a framework for involving human influence in algorithmic decision-making for contentious public policy issues. This approach emphasizes the importance of viewing publics as plural political entities, collective decision-making through deliberation, and the construction of publics. I believe that by incorporating these features, we can advance our understanding of stakeholder participation in AI design and improve the way that contentious public policy issues are addressed.\n\nIn addition to my work on algorithmic decision-making, I have also been exploring ways to enhance email functionality. I believe that there is still much that can be done to improve this long-standing communication tool. In particular, I have been investigating the use of late bound content, a simple and generalizable technique that defers message content binding through image lazy-loading. This allows email senders and third-party services to update delivered emails, adding new features and functionality.\n\nOverall, my research is focused on finding ways to make technology more responsive to the needs and desires of users, while also taking into account the broader societal implications of these tools. I am excited to continue exploring these topics and to contribute to the ongoing conversation about the role of humans in the design and implementation of technology.",
