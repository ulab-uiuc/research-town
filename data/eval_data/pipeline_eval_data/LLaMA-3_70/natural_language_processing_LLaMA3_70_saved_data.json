In adversarial defense, we investigate the use of ensemble learning to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. For multimodal representation learning, we propose a novel approach for extending distributed representation learning to multimodal temporal data, such as videos with audio and text, by developing a cross-modality alignment mechanism. In interactive learning, we explore the use of user feedback and interaction to improve the understanding and processing of multimodal data, focusing on multimodal similarity models. Finally, we discuss progressive pre-training and fine-tuning strategies to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in deep learning models when fine-tuning for new tasks.
