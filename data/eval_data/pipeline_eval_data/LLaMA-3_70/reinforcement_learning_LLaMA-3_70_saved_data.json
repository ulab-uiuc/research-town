In hierarchical memory structures, we discuss combining different memory models and developing new architectures to enhance memory of complex, multi-level patterns. For attention mechanisms in state-space models, we investigate integrating attention mechanisms directly into state-space models to improve their ability to capture long-term dependencies and contextual information. In dynamic random feedback weights, we expand on the concept of using random feedback weights in deep neural networks, investigating dynamic feedback weight schemes for a more adaptive and flexible error-signal processing mechanism. Multi-compartment neurons with dendritic processing aim to better understand the computational principles underlying cortical microcircuits, potentially inspiring the development of new deep learning architectures. Lastly, we discuss lifelong continual learning, focusing on developing algorithms that enable networks to learn new tasks autonomously and adapt to changing environments without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.

We first investigate the use of meta-learning techniques to enable models to learn how to best adjust their own learning rates during training, leading to more efficient and effective optimization methods that can adapt to a wider range of problems and architectures. Next, we examine the potential of hierarchical memory addressing schemes in Neural Turing Machine extensions, which would allow for more complex and nuanced manipulation of memory and enable models to handle a wider variety of tasks and data structures. We also explore the combination of mollifying networks with attention mechanisms, which would enable models to focus on specific parts of the input when optimizing the smoothed objective function, leading to more efficient and effective optimization for large-scale learning problems. Additionally, we consider the application of planning mechanisms to recurrent neural networks, which would enable RNNs to plan ahead when processing sequences and improve their performance on tasks that require long-term dependencies and memory.
