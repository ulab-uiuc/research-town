This involves investigating key technical components and multimodal datasets to advance the development of Artificial Intelligence for Generative Content (AIGC) and world models.\n2. **Zero-Shot Reasoning and Segmentation**: A new task has been introduced for zero-shot 3D reasoning segmentation, which transcends limitations for previous category-specific 3D semantic segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation. This task involves understanding and executing complex commands for fine-grained segmenting specific parts for 3D meshes with contextual awareness and reasoned answers for interactive segmentation.\n3. **Natural Language Processing and Robotics**: The use of natural language processing in robotics has led to the development of models and frameworks that enable robots to perform complex tasks, such as task-oriented object grasping and rearrangement, by learning from human demonstrations. This involves creating novel object representations, such as the Multi-feature Implicit Model (MIMO), that encode multiple spatial features between a point and an object in an implicit neural field.\n4. **Multimodal Representation Learning**: There is interest in multimodal representation learning, specifically for images and texts. This involves training deep multimodal similarity models (DMSM) to maximize global semantic similarity between images and their captions in natural language, thereby capturing the combination of various visual concepts and cues.\n5. **Conversational AI**: Research in conversational AI involves surveying neural approaches and grouping conversational systems into three categories: question answering agents, task-oriented dialogue agents, and chatbots. This also includes addressing challenges in building intelligent open-domain dialog systems, specifically addressing the challenges of semantics.\n6. **Data Augmentation for Spoken Language Understanding**: Data augmentation techniques for spoken language understanding (SLU) involve using pretrained language models to boost the variability and accuracy of generated utterances.
