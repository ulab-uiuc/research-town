We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GenBaB framework on a wide range of neural networks and computational graphs, including LSTMs and Vision Transformers.

We first investigate the trade-off between privacy and utility in local privacy methods and show that adaptive mechanisms can improve performance while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. We then propose the combination of local privacy methods with multi-party computation for privacy-preserving data analysis on vertically partitioned data, allowing for more complex analyses while preserving privacy. We also demonstrate the application of federated learning methods to graph neural networks, enabling privacy-preserving analysis of graph-structured data distributed across multiple devices or organizations. Additionally, we show that large language models trained on public data can significantly improve the quality of pre-training data for on-device models trained with differential privacy and federated learning, leading to better performance and faster convergence. Finally, we discuss new methods for federated optimization that incorporate differential privacy and secure multi-party computation, allowing for privacy-preserving optimization of machine learning models in distributed settings with limited communication resources.

We investigate the relationship between the insensitivity of user distribution in multicell networks and the verification of neural networks, aiming to gain new insights into the fundamental properties of wireless networks. Additionally, we utilize large-scale pre-trained generative models to predict and generate user distribution patterns in multicell networks, which can help in optimizing network performance and resource allocation. We also propose a novel framework for conducting branch-and-bound (BaB) for general nonlinearities in general computational graphs based on linear bound propagation, which can be used for verifying a wide range of neural networks and computation graphs. Furthermore, we introduce a spectrum-aware adaptation framework for generative models, which adjusts both singular values and their basis vectors of pretrained weights, achieving parameter-efficient adaptation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through various experiments and provide open-source implementations for reproducibility.",
