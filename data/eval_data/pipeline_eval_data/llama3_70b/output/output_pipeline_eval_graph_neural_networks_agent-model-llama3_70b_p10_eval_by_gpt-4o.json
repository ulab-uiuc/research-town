First, we investigate the use of probabilistic deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for learning the underlying probability distributions of complex datasets more accurately and efficiently. We propose combining these models with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Boltzmann Machines (BMs) to create hybrid architectures that leverage the strengths of both types of models. Second, we apply the concept of geometry of probability distributions to reinforcement learning, where the goal is to learn the optimal policy for a given environment. By studying the geometry of the sets of policies representable by different reinforcement learning algorithms, we develop new methods for optimizing policies more effectively and efficiently. Third, we explore the use of deep learning techniques for improving the compression efficiency of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm in sequential recurrence-based multidimensional universal source coding. A deep neural network is trained to predict the next symbol in a sequence based on the previous symbols, and this predicted sequence is used to guide the compression process. Finally, we discuss the implications of the study of mode posets and probability polytopes for the field of robust statistics, and how this understanding can be used to develop new methods for estimating statistical models that are more robust to outliers and other sources of noise in the data.",

Performance evaluations of PMem have led to guidelines for efficient PMem usage and the development of I/O primitives tuned for PMem.\n4. Deep Sketches: Compact models of databases, powered by a new deep learning approach to cardinality estimation, have been introduced to estimate the result sizes of SQL queries. Deep Sketches can capture correlations between columns, even across tables, and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional cardinality estimators.\n5. Machine learning for computer vision: Recent research has focused on various training and learning approaches in computer vision, such as adversarial learning, contrastive learning, diffusion denoising learning, and ordinary reconstruction learning. Fine-tuning approaches, like low-rank adaptation (LoRA), have also been explored to enhance overall performance with reduced GPU memory usage and time costs.\n6. Hardware accelerators for deep learning: To address memory and computation resource constraints, hardware accelerators like computation-in-memory (CIM) with memristive devices have been developed. These accelerators focus on optimizing common operations, such as matrix-vector multiplication, and improving confidence in NN predictions in the presence of device non-idealities.",

First, we investigate the potential of developing a dynamic memory allocator selection mechanism that considers the specific workload, aiming to further optimize performance and resource utilization. Second, we propose a hybrid deep learning and traditional cardinality estimator approach, combining the strengths of deep learning-based cardinality estimators with traditional methods for more accurate and efficient estimations. Lastly, we delve into adversarial training techniques for robust computer vision models, enhancing their robustness against malicious attacks and real-world variations by generating adversarial examples during training. Additionally, we discuss memory-efficient fine-tuning techniques for hardware accelerators and confidence calibration for persistent memory systems, ensuring reliability and optimal performance in these emerging technologies.",
