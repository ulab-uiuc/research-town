In this paper, we explore several novel ideas and insights to improve the trade-off between privacy and utility in such settings. First, we propose combining local privacy methods with multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving data analysis on vertically partitioned data, where different parties hold different features of the same samples. We show that adaptive mechanisms that adjust the amount of noise added based on the sensitivity of the data can significantly improve the performance of local privacy methods while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Second, we apply federated learning methods to graph neural networks, allowing for privacy-preserving analysis of graph-structured data distributed across multiple devices or organizations. We demonstrate that large language models trained on public data can significantly improve the quality of pre-training data for on-device models trained with differential privacy and federated learning, leading to better performance and faster convergence. Finally, we develop new methods for federated optimization that incorporate differential privacy and secure multi-party computation, allowing for privacy-preserving optimization of machine learning models in distributed settings with limited communication resources. These methods enable new applications in areas such as edge computing and IoT. We validate our findings through controlled experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, and provide open-source code for reproducibility.",
