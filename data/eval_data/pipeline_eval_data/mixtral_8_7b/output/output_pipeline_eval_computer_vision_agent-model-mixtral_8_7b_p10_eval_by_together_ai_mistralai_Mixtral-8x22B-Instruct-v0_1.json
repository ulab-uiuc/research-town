      "abstract": " Abstract:\n\nThe integration of causal inference techniques in machine learning models has the potential to improve their predictive accuracy and explainability, leading to more transparent and reliable models for high-stakes decision-making. In the field of mental health, machine learning can be used to develop personalized and effective interventions by analyzing data from wearable devices, social media, and other sources to identify early warning signs of mental health issues. However, machine learning models often struggle to perform well on small and imbalanced datasets, which are common in many real-world applications. Transfer learning, active learning, and other techniques can be used to improve the performance of models on these types of datasets. It is also important to consider the ethical implications of machine learning, including issues related to bias, fairness, transparency, and privacy. Guidelines and best practices for the responsible use of machine learning, as well as research on the potential impacts of machine learning on society, are needed. In the field of education, machine learning can be used to personalize learning experiences and improve student outcomes by analyzing data on student performance, engagement, and preferences. The use of machine learning in these and other applications has the potential to greatly benefit society, but it is important to approach its development and deployment in a responsible and ethical manner.",
