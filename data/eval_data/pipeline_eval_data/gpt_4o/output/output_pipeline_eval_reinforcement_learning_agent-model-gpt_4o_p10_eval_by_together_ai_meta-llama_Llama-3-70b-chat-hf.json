This paper explores two noteworthy areas\u2014**Meta-Learning for Cross-Domain Transfer Learning** and **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Modular Skill Building**\u2014which collectively aim to address significant challenges in model adaptability and efficiency. We propose enhancing gradient-based meta-learning frameworks to support cross-domain tasks through the incorporation of domain adaptation layers. These adaptive layers can dynamically adjust based on meta-learned domain representations, enabling models to transfer knowledge efficiently from one domain to another with minimal labeled data. Concurrently, we explore a hierarchical reinforcement learning system designed to decompose complex tasks into modular skills learned by lower-level policies. These skills can then be sequenced and integrated by higher-level policies to facilitate zero-shot transferability across different tasks, optimizing both exploration and exploitation.
