Geometry of probability distributions: You have studied the geometry of the sets of probability distributions representable by RBMs and BMs, and have shown that deep narrow Boltzmann machines are universal approximators of probability distributions on the activities of their visible units, provided they have sufficiently many hidden layers, each containing the same number of units as the visible layer. Your work on providing upper and lower bounds on the sufficient depth and width of universal approximators has provided valuable insights into the properties of these models.\n3.

The reviewers have identified several strengths of the paper, including its interdisciplinary approach, use of external data to support and illustrate the ideas presented, and discussion of potential applications of the proposed integration.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have also identified some weaknesses in the paper.
