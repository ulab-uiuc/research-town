Neural Network Verification: You have worked on developing a general framework for branch-and-bound (BaB) neural network verification for general nonlinearities in computational graphs based on linear bound propagation. Your approach is effective in verifying a wide range of NNs, including networks with various activation functions and multi-dimensional nonlinear operations. Your work on GenBaB has also enabled verification applications beyond simple neural networks, such as AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF).\n2. State-Space Models and Attention Mechanisms: You have explored the relationship between state-space models (SSMs) and variants of attention in deep learning, particularly in language modeling. Your state space duality (SSD) framework has allowed for the design of a new architecture (Mamba-2) that is faster and competitive with Transformers in language modeling.\n3. Data Structures and Algorithms for High-Dimensional Data: Your focus on developing efficient data structures and algorithms for high-dimensional data and statistical learning tasks has led to the creation of the Anchors Hierarchy, a fast data structure and algorithm for localizing data based on a triangle-inequality-obeying distance metric. This structure can be used to accelerate various statistical learning algorithms in high-dimensional spaces.\n4. Nonlinear Statistical Optimization: You have investigated a new approach to searching the combinatorial space of contingency tables during the inner loop of a nonlinear statistical optimization, called RADSEARCH. This approach finds the global optimum and outperforms other recent successful search algorithms. You have also used RADSEARCH to develop a new regression algorithm for learning real-valued outputs, called RADREG.\n5. Bayesian Networks: Your work in developing techniques for quickly learning probability density functions from data in low-dimensional continuous space has led to the proposal of a kind of Bayesian networks that combine low-dimensional mixtures of Gaussians over different subsets of the domain's variables into a coherent joint probability model over the entire domain. You have presented efficient heuristic algorithms for automatically learning these networks from data and have performed comparative experiments that illustrate their effectiveness in modeling real scientific data and synthetic data.\n6.

In hierarchical memory structures, we discuss combining different memory models and developing new architectures to enhance memory of complex, multi-level patterns. For attention mechanisms in state-space models, we investigate integrating attention mechanisms directly into state-space models to improve their ability to capture long-term dependencies and contextual information. In dynamic random feedback weights, we expand on the concept of using random feedback weights in deep neural networks, investigating dynamic feedback weight schemes for a more adaptive and flexible error-signal processing mechanism. Multi-compartment neurons with dendritic processing aim to better understand the computational principles underlying cortical microcircuits, potentially inspiring the development of new deep learning architectures. Lastly, we discuss lifelong continual learning, focusing on developing algorithms that enable networks to learn new tasks autonomously and adapt to changing environments without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. External data from recent papers support these research directions, highlighting the importance of understanding and improving memory, attention, and learning algorithms for neural networks.",
