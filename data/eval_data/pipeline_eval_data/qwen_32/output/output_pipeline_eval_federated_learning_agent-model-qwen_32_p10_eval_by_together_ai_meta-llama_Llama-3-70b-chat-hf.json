We then apply machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, to the study of configuration space integrals to discover new patterns and relationships. Next, we extend topological constructions to hypergraphs, providing a new way to model and analyze complex systems, such as political structures, social networks, and biological systems. By studying the topological properties of hypergraphs, we can gain insights into the structure and behavior of these systems, and develop new methods for controlling and optimizing them. We also explore the formality of the little N-disks operad and its potential applications in developing new theoretical frameworks for machine learning, by providing a way to characterize and analyze the topological structure of computational graphs. This could lead to new methods for verifying and optimizing neural networks, as well as a better understanding of the fundamental principles underlying machine learning algorithms. Additionally, we discuss the calculus of the embedding functor and its potential applications in fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and control theory. By associating a Taylor tower to the space of curves or shapes, we can study their cohomology spectral sequence and gain insights into their topological structure, which could be used to develop new algorithms for shape recognition, tracking, and manipulation. Finally, we propose the development of hypergraph neural networks, where the nodes and hyperedges of hypergraphs are associated with neurons and the topological relationships between them are learned and optimized through training.
