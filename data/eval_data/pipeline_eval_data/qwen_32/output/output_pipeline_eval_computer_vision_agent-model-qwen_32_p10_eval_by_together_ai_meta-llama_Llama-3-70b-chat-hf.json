Diffusion models can be used for 3D scene synthesis by learning the underlying distribution of 3D scenes and generating new scenes that are similar to the training data. Multi-task learning can be applied to video to depth estimation to improve the accuracy of the depth estimation by training the network to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Finally, explainable AI techniques can be used for automated theorem proving to help users understand how the system arrived at a particular proof, increasing trust in the system's capabilities.

We present related work and external data in each of these areas, demonstrating the progress and challenges in each domain. In transfer learning for abnormal object recognition, we find that pre-trained models from object detection tasks can significantly improve the performance of abnormal object recognition models, particularly when limited abnormal data is available. The combination of DEC with generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), leads to more robust anomaly detection by learning the underlying data distribution and generating new samples for better representation. Multi-task learning for MLLMs helps improve performance in various tasks, such as video captioning, visual question answering, and action recognition, by learning shared representations across tasks. Physics-guided 3D scene synthesis generates more realistic and plausible scenes by enforcing physical constraints derived from Newtonian physics during the synthesis process. Lastly, extending models for visual Newtonian dynamics to perform zero-shot prediction enables the prediction of the dynamics of novel objects or scenarios without explicit training, making the model more versatile and adaptable. The findings from this paper contribute to the ongoing development of AI and ML techniques, offering insights and directions for future research.",
