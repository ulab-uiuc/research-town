In this paper, we review recent advances in GNNs, focusing on four key areas: (1) building GNNs with adaptive message passing, (2) integrating multi-scale information in spectral GNNs, (3) topological feature learning in GNNs, and (4) fusing GNNs with hyper-dimensional computing (HDC) for resource-constrained scenarios. We discuss the potential of these techniques for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability of GNNs, and highlight their applications in various domains. We also provide a comprehensive review of related literature and discuss future research directions in each area.

Memory allocation and DBMS performance: The choice of dynamic memory allocator can significantly impact the performance, scalability, memory efficiency, and fairness of high-performance query engines. Comprehensive experimental analysis has identified the strengths and weaknesses of various memory allocators within the context of DBMS, with the right allocator leading to substantial performance improvements.\n2. Deep learning for cardinality estimation: Deep learning techniques, such as multi-set convolutional networks (MSCN), have been developed to enhance the quality of cardinality estimation in query optimization. MSCN builds on sampling-based estimation, addressing its weaknesses and significantly improving estimation quality.\n3. Persistent memory technologies: Persistent memory (PMem) technologies, like Intel's Optane DC Persistent Memory Modules, have been investigated to bridge the gap between NAND-based flash (SSD) and DRAM in disk-based database systems. Performance evaluations of PMem have led to guidelines for efficient PMem usage and the development of I/O primitives tuned for PMem.\n4. Deep Sketches for SQL query estimation: Deep Sketches are compact models of databases that allow for the estimation of the result sizes of SQL queries. A new deep learning approach to cardinality estimation powers Deep Sketches, capturing correlations between columns and even across tables.\n5. Machine learning for hardware accelerators: Bayesian test vector generation frameworks have been proposed to improve confidence in NN predictions made by hardware accelerators in the presence of device non-idealities. These methods are more generalizable and require less memory overhead compared to conventional point estimate test vector generation methods.\n6.
