In light of the robustness of the ADASECANT method for adaptively tuning learning rates in deep neural networks, the paper suggests the use of meta-learning techniques to enable models to learn how to best adjust their own learning rates during training, leading to more efficient and effective optimization methods. The paper also discusses the potential of hierarchical memory addressing schemes in Neural Turing Machine extensions, such as the dynamic neural Turing machine model, to model longer-term dependencies and more complex memory access patterns. Additionally, the integration of planning mechanisms into reinforcement learning algorithms is explored, allowing agents to learn how to plan and make decisions in complex, dynamic environments. The paper also investigates the use of attention mechanisms in memory-augmented networks, which could lead to more efficient and effective memory utilization and improved interpretability of model decisions.
