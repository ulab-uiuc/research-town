This paper explores four key areas in GNN research: multi-scale representations, robustness, explainability, and lifelong learning. First, we discuss multi-scale GNNs that effectively capture both local and global graph structures, addressing the need for explicit 3D shape preprocessing and enabling real-world applications like robotics and augmented reality. Second, we investigate integrating GNNs with differentiable renderers, which can enable learning 3D shape representations directly from raw 2D image data. Third, we study adversarial training techniques for GNNs to enhance their robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy graph data. Fourth, we delve into explainability in GNNs, focusing on building trust in these models and providing insights into their decision-making processes. Lastly, we explore lifelong learning techniques for GNNs, enabling them to continuously learn and adapt to new graph data, addressing the challenge of non-stationary graph distributions and improving their long-term performance and applicability.

Fine-tuning approaches like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have also been explored to enhance overall performance with reduced GPU memory usage and time costs.", "paper": " Title: Advancements in Intelligent Systems: Memory Allocators, Persistent Memory, Explainable Deep Learning, and More\n\nAbstract: This paper provides an overview of recent advancements in intelligent systems, focusing on five key areas: memory allocator choices in database management systems (DBMS), hardware-software co-design for persistent memory in DBMS, explainable deep learning for cardinality estimation, multi-task learning for computer vision training, and adversarial robustness in computer vision. In the context of memory allocator choices in DBMS, we discuss the potential of combining memory allocators and deep learning techniques to optimize DBMS performance, leading to adaptive query engines that can self-tune memory allocator choices based on workload characteristics. For hardware-software co-design for persistent memory in DBMS, we explore the development of customized I/O primitives and hardware support for memory management, which can enhance PMem usage efficiency and performance in disk-based database systems. In the realm of explainable deep learning for cardinality estimation, we highlight the need for more explainable models to understand the underlying decision-making processes, building trust and providing insights for further optimization. We also delve into multi-task learning for computer vision training, which can improve overall performance and reduce memory usage by training a single model to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously. Lastly, we discuss adversarial robustness in computer vision, focusing on research in adversarial training and defense techniques to improve model robustness and reduce vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.
