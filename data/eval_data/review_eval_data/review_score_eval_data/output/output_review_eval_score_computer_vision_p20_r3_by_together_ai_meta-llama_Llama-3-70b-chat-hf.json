      "abstract": "While recent camera-only 3D detection methods leverage multiple timesteps, the limited history they use significantly hampers the extent to which temporal fusion can improve object perception. Observing that existing works' fusion of multi-frame images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set.

      "abstract": "While some state-of-the-art artificial neural network systems in computer vision are strikingly accurate models of the corresponding primate visual processing, there are still many discrepancies between these models and the behavior of primates on object recognition tasks. Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings  across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model \"IT\" representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness. We further assessed the limitations of this approach and find that the improvements in behavioral alignment and adversarial robustness generalize across different image statistics, but not to object categories outside of those covered in our IT training set. Taken together, our results demonstrate that building models that are more aligned with the primate brain leads to more robust and human-like behavior, and call for larger neural data-sets to further augment these gains.",

The authors' use of neural population activity in the IT cortex to fine-tune model representations is a novel and effective approach. The results, which show a strong correlation between IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, are impressive and suggest that this approach could lead to more robust and human-like AI models. However, the limitations of the study, such as the need for larger neural datasets and the restricted generalizability of the results, are areas for future improvement.\n\n**Review 3:**\nTitle: \"From Primates to AI: Aligning Model Representations for Improved Object Recognition\"\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThis paper presents an interesting approach to improving object recognition in AI models by aligning their representations with those of the macaque IT cortex. The authors' use of chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings from non-human primates is a significant contribution to the field. The results, which show a correlation between IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, are promising. However, the study's limitations, such as the restricted generalizability of the results and the need for larger neural datasets, are areas for future improvement. Additionally, the study could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the neural mechanisms underlying object recognition in primates.\n\n**Review 4:**\nTitle: \"Aligning AI"

      "abstract": "Visual description, detection, and matching of keypoints in images are fundamental components of many computer vision problems, such as camera tracking and (re)localization. Recently, learning-based feature extractors on top of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we further explore the usage of CNN and present a new approach that ensembles randomly initialized CNNs without any training. Our observation is that the CNN architecture inherently extracts features with certain extents of robustness to viewpoint/illumination changes and thus, it can be regarded as visual descriptors. Consequently, randomized CNNs serve as descriptor extractors and a subsequent consensus mechanism detects keypoints using them. Such description and detection pipeline can be used to match keypoints in images and achieves higher generalization ability than the state-of-the-art methods in our experiments. ",

      "abstract": "The current approach to ML model design is either to choose a flexible Blackbox model and explain it post hoc or to start with an interpretable model. Blackbox models are flexible but difficult to explain, whereas interpretable models are designed to be explainable. However, developing interpretable models necessitates extensive ML knowledge, and the resulting models tend to be less flexible, offering potentially subpar performance compared to their Blackbox equivalents. This paper aims to blur the distinction between a post hoc explanation of a BlackBox and constructing interpretable models. We propose beginning with a flexible BlackBox model and gradually carving out a mixture of interpretable models and a residual network. Our design identifies a subset of samples and routes them through the interpretable models. The remaining samples are routed through a flexible residual network. We adopt First Order Logic (FOL) as the interpretable model's backbone, which provides basic reasoning on the concept retrieved from the BlackBox model. On the residual network, we repeat the method until the proportion of data explained by the residual network falls below a desired threshold. \nOur approach offers several advantages. First, the mixture of interpretable and flexible residual networks results in almost no compromise in performance. Second, the rout, interpret, and repeat approach yields a highly flexible interpretable model. Our extensive experiment demonstrates the performance of the model on various datasets. We show that by editing the FOL model, we can fix the shortcut learned by the original BlackBox model. Finally, our method provides a framework for a hybrid symbolic-connectionist network that is simple to train and adaptable to many applications.",

      "abstract": "A central question of machine learning is how deep nets  manage to learn tasks in high dimensions. An appealing hypothesis is that they achieve this feat by building a representation of the data where information  irrelevant to the task is lost. For image data sets, this view is supported by the observation that after (and not before) training,  the neural representation becomes less and less sensitive to diffeomorphisms acting on images as the signal propagates through the net.  \nThis loss of sensitivity correlates with performance, and surprisingly  also correlates  with a gain of sensitivity to white noise acquired during training. These facts are unexplained, and as we demonstrate still hold when white noise is added to the images of the training set. Here, we (i) show empirically for various architectures that stability to image diffeomorphisms is achieved by spatial pooling in the first half of the net, and by channel pooling in the second half, (ii) introduce a scale-detection task for a simple model of data where pooling is learnt during training, which captures all empirical observations above and (iii) compute in this model how stability to diffeomorphisms and noise scale with depth. The scalings are found to depend on the presence of strides in the net architecture. We find that the increased sensitivity to noise is due to the perturbing noise piling up during pooling, after a ReLU non-linearity is applied to the noise in the internal layers.",

      "abstract": "Today\u2019s computer vision models achieve human or near-human level performance across a wide variety of vision tasks. However, their architectures, data, and learning algorithms differ in numerous ways from those that give rise to human vision. In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect the alignment between the representations learned by neural networks and human mental representations inferred from behavioral responses. We find that model scale and architecture have essentially no effect on the alignment with human behavioral responses, whereas the training dataset and objective function both have a much larger impact. These findings are consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected using two different tasks. Linear transformations of neural network representations learned from behavioral responses from one dataset substantially improve alignment with human similarity judgments on the other two datasets. In addition, we find that some human concepts such as food and animals are well-represented by neural networks whereas others such as royal or sports-related objects are not. Overall, although models trained on larger, more diverse datasets achieve better alignment with humans than models trained on ImageNet alone, our results indicate that scaling alone is unlikely to be sufficient to train neural networks with conceptual representations that match those used by humans.",

      "title": "Vera Verto: Multimodal Hijacking Attack",
      "abstract": "The increasing cost of training machine learning (ML) models has led to the inclusion of new parties to the training pipeline, such as users who contribute training data and companies that provide computing resources. This involvement of such new parties in the ML training process has introduced new attack surfaces for an adversary to exploit. A recent attack in this domain is the model hijacking attack, whereby an adversary hijacks a victim model to implement their own -- possibly malicious -- hijacking tasks. However, the scope of the model hijacking attack is so far limited to computer vision-related tasks. In this paper, we transform the model hijacking attack into a more general multimodal setting, where the hijacking and original tasks are performed on data of different modalities. Specifically, we focus on the setting where an adversary implements a natural language processing (NLP) hijacking task into an image classification model. To mount the attack, we propose a novel encoder-decoder based framework, namely the Blender, which relies on advanced image and language models. Experimental results show that our modal hijacking attack achieves strong performances in different settings. For instance, our attack achieves 94%, 94%, and 95% attack success rate when using the Sogou news dataset to hijack STL10, CIFAR-10, and MNIST classifiers.",

      "title": "PBFormer: Capturing Complex Scene Text Shape with Polynomial Band Transformer",
      "abstract": "We present PBFormer, an efficient yet powerful scene text detector that unifies the transformer with a novel text shape representation Polynomial  Band (PB).  The representation has four polynomial curves to fit a text's top, bottom, left, and right sides, which can capture a text with a complex shape by varying polynomial coefficients.  PB has appealing features compared with conventional representations: 1)  It can model different curvatures with a fixed number of parameters, while polygon-points-based methods need to utilize a different number of points.  2) It can distinguish adjacent or overlapping texts as they have apparent different curve coefficients, while segmentation-based methods suffer from adhesive spatial positions. PBFormer combines the PB with the transformer, which can directly generate smooth text contours sampled from predicted curves without interpolation.  To leverage the advantage of PB,  PBFormer has a parameter-free cross-scale pixel attention module.  The module can enlarge text features and suppress irrelevant areas to benefit from detecting texts with diverse scale variations.  Furthermore, PBFormer is trained with a shape-contained loss, which not only enforces the piecewise alignment between the ground truth and the predicted curves but also makes curves' position and shapes consistent with each other.  Without bells and whistles about text pre-training, our method is superior to the previous state-of-the-art text detectors on the arbitrary-shaped CTW1500 and Total-Text datasets.

      "title": "The Geometry of Self-supervised Learning Models and its Impact on Transfer Learning",
      "abstract": "Self-supervised learning~(SSL) has emerged as a desirable paradigm in computer vision due to the inability of supervised models to learn representations that can generalize in domains with limited labels. The recent popularity of SSL has led to the development of several models that make use of diverse training strategies, architectures, and data augmentation policies with no existing unified framework to study or assess their effectiveness in transfer learning.\nWe propose a data-driven geometric strategy to analyze different SSL models using local neighborhoods in the feature space induced by each. Unlike existing approaches that consider mathematical approximations of the parameters, individual components, or optimization landscape, our work aims to explore the geometric properties of the representation manifolds learned by SSL models.\nOur proposed manifold graph metrics~(MGMs) \nprovide insights into the geometric similarities and differences between available SSL models, their invariances with respect to specific augmentations, and their performances on transfer learning tasks. Our key findings are two fold: $(i)$ contrary to popular belief, the geometry of SSL models is not tied to its training paradigm (contrastive, non-contrastive, and cluster-based); $(ii)$ we can predict the transfer learning capability for a specific model based on the geometric properties of its semantic and augmentation manifolds.",

      "title": "TaskPrompter: Spatial-Channel Multi-Task Prompting for Dense Scene Understanding",
      "abstract": "Learning effective representations simultaneously from multiple tasks in a unified network framework is a fundamental paradigm for multi-task dense visual scene understanding. This requires joint modeling (i) task-generic and (ii) task-specific representations, and (iii) cross-task representation interactions. Existing works typically model these three perspectives with separately designed structures, using shared network modules for task-generic learning, different modules for task-specific learning, and establishing connections among these components for cross-task interactions. It is barely explored in the literature to model these three perspectives in each network layer in an end-to-end manner, which can not only minimize the effort of carefully designing empirical structures for the three multi-task representation learning objectives, but also greatly improve the representation learning capability of the multi-task network since all the model capacity will be used to optimize the three objectives together. In this paper, we propose TaskPrompter, a novel spatial-channel multi-task prompting transformer framework to achieve this target. Specifically, we design a set of spatial-channel task prompts and learn their spatial- and channel interactions with the shared image tokens in each transformer layer with attention mechanism, as aggregating spatial and channel information is critical for dense prediction tasks. Each task prompt learns task-specific representation for one task, while all the prompts can jointly contribute to the learning of the shared image token representations, and the interactions between different task prompts model the cross-task relationship. To decode dense predictions for multiple tasks with the learned spatial-channel task prompts from transformer, we accordingly design a dense task prompt decoding mechanism, which queries the shared image tokens using task prompts to obtain spatial- and channel-wise task-specific representations. Extensive experiments on two challenging multi-task dense scene understanding benchmarks (i.e. NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context) show the superiority of the proposed framework and TaskPrompter establishes significant state-of-the-art performances on multi-task dense predictions.

      "abstract": "Neural network weights are typically initialized at random from univariate distributions, controlling just the variance of individual weights even in highly-structured operations like convolutions. Recent ViT-inspired convolutional networks such as ConvMixer and ConvNeXt use large-kernel depthwise convolutions whose learned filters have notable structure; this presents an opportunity to study their empirical covariances. In this work, we first observe that such learned filters have highly-structured covariance matrices, and moreover, we find that covariances calculated from small networks may be used to effectively initialize a variety of larger networks of different depths, widths, patch sizes, and kernel sizes, indicating a degree of model-independence to the covariance structure. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a learning-free multivariate initialization scheme for convolutional filters using a simple, closed-form construction of their covariance. Models using our initialization outperform those using traditional univariate initializations, and typically meet or exceed the performance of those initialized from the covariances of learned filters; in some cases, this improvement can be achieved without training the depthwise convolutional filters at all.

      "abstract": "Humans have been shown to use a ''straightened'' encoding to represent the natural visual world as it evolves in time (Henaff et al. 2019). In the context of discrete video sequences, ''straightened'' means that changes between frames follow a more linear path in representation space at progressively deeper levels of processing. While deep convolutional networks are often proposed as models of human visual processing, many do not straighten natural videos. In this paper, we explore the relationship between network architecture, differing types of robustness, biologically-inspired filtering mechanisms, and representational straightness in response to time-varying input; we identify strengths and limitations of straightness as a useful way of evaluating neural network representations. We find that (1) adversarial training leads to straighter representations in both CNN and transformer-based architectures but (2) this effect is task-dependent, not generalizing to tasks such as segmentation and frame-prediction, where straight representations are not favorable for predictions; and nor to other types of robustness. In addition, (3) straighter representations impart temporal stability to class predictions, even for out-of-distribution data. Finally, (4) biologically-inspired elements increase straightness in the early stages of a network, but do not guarantee increased straightness in downstream layers of CNNs. We show that straightness is an easily computed measure of representational robustness and stability, as well as a hallmark of human representations with benefits for computer vision models.",

Contemporary psychological theories consider language and speech as devices to understand complex psychological processes and deliver them as cultural products of ideas and communication. Sign and gesture language, offering an intelligent co-ordination of eye-and-hand and ear-and-mouth, has evolved as an intelligent manifestation of speech for the impaired. However, they have very limited modality and iconicity in accommodating a greater range of linguistically relevant meanings. URVoice is an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device, which currently features a pipeline of forward communication from signer to collocutor with a novel approach shouldered on convex hull using vision-based approach. The solution achieves real time translation of gesture to text/voice using convex hull as the computational geometry, which follows Akl-Toussaint heuristic and Graham-Sklansky scan algorithms. The results are weighed against our other solutions based on conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches. A futuristic version of URVoice, with voice translated to sign language gestures, will be a complete solution for effectively bridging the cognitive and communication gap between the impaired and the abled lot.",

      "abstract": "Few datasets contain self-identified demographic information, inferring demographic information risks introducing additional biases, and collecting and storing data on sensitive attributes can carry legal risks. Besides, categorical demographic labels do not necessarily capture all the relevant dimensions of human diversity. We propose to implicitly learn a set of continuous face-varying dimensions, without ever asking an annotator to explicitly categorize a person. We uncover the dimensions by learning on A View From Somewhere (AVFS) dataset of 638,180 human judgments of face similarity. We demonstrate the utility of our learned embedding space for predicting face similarity judgments, collecting continuous face attribute values, attribute classification, and comparative dataset diversity auditing. Moreover, using a novel conditional framework, we show that an annotator's demographics influences the \\emph{importance} they place on different attributes when judging similarity, underscoring the \\emph{need} for diverse annotator groups to avoid biases.

By leveraging a massive dataset of human judgments of face similarity, the authors implicitly learn a set of continuous face-varying dimensions that capture the complexity of human diversity. This approach avoids the pitfalls of categorical demographic labels and explicit annotation, which can introduce biases and legal risks. The results demonstrate the utility of the learned embedding space for various tasks, including face similarity judgments, attribute classification, and dataset diversity auditing. The conditional framework used to analyze annotator demographics and attribute importance is particularly insightful, highlighting the need for diverse annotator groups to mitigate biases. Overall, this work has significant implications for the development of fair and inclusive face recognition systems.\n\n**Review 2: A Step Towards Fairer Face Recognition**\n\nThe authors of \"A View From Somewhere\" tackle the critical issue of bias in face recognition systems by proposing a novel approach to learning face representations. By eschewing categorical demographic labels and explicit annotation, they avoid introducing additional biases and legal risks.

      "abstract": "Vision language models like CLIP are robust to natural distribution shifts, in part because CLIP learns on unstructured data using a technique called caption supervision; the model inteprets image-linked texts as ground-truth labels. In a carefully controlled comparison study, we show that CNNs trained on a standard cross-entropy loss can also benefit from caption supervision, in some cases even more than VL models, on the same data. To facilitate future experiments with high-accuracy caption-supervised models, we introduce CaptionNet, one piece of which is a class-balanced, fully supervised dataset with over 50,000 new human-labeled ImageNet-compliant samples which includes web-scraped captions. In a series of experiments on CaptionNet, we show how the choice of loss function, data filtration and supervision strategy enable robust computer vision.",
