Moreover, leveraging the advantages of hierarchical network design, we propose a new label-driven knowledge distillation (LKD) technique at the global server to address the second problem. As opposed to current knowledge distillation techniques, LKD is capable of training a student model, which consists of good knowledge from all teachers' models. Therefore, our proposed algorithm can effectively extract the knowledge of the regions' data distribution (i.e., the regional aggregated models) to reduce the divergence between clients' models when operating under the FL system with non-independent identically distributed data. Extensive experiment results reveal that: (i) our F2L method can significantly improve the overall FL efficiency in all global distillations, and (ii) F2L rapidly achieves convergence as global distillation stages occur instead of increasing on each communication cycle.",

        "### Comprehensive Review of Federated Learning Approaches to Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs:\n\n#### Review of \"Share Your Representation Only: Guaranteed Improvement of the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in Federated Learning\"\nIn the domain of federated learning, ensuring the privacy of data while maintaining its utility is paramount. The paper titled **\"Share Your Representation Only: Guaranteed Improvement of the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in Federated Learning\"** presents a novel approach to achieving this balance effectively. One notable challenge with traditional federated learning approaches is the extensive information leakage that occurs with repeated parameter sharing. This defeat the primary goal of maintaining data privacy. Although differentially private algorithms have been employed to mitigate such risks, they often come with significant trade-offs leading to reduced model convergence and utility.\n\nAddressing this concern, the authors of this paper introduce a new algorithm, \\DPFEDREP, which promotes collaborative refinement of the consensus part of the model while ensuring differential privacy guarantees. This algorithm allows for sufficient local personalization without the need for sharing it. The analytical strength of their proposed method lies in the proof that, despite the non-convex nature of the linear representation setting, \\DPFEDREP\\ converges at a linear rate to a ball centered around the global optimal solution. Notably, the radius of this ball is inversely proportional to the privacy budget, showcasing an innovative utility analysis. \n\nOne of the most compelling improvements reported by this paper is the enhancement in the privacy-utility tradeoff, achieving a factor improvement of $\\sqrt{d}$ (where $d$ is the input dimension) over state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. This is significant because it demonstrates that high utility can be preserved even under stringent privacy constraints. Experimental validation on prominent image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, EMNIST) corroborates the theoretical claims, showing substantial performance improvements over prior work under similar privacy budgets. This paper indeed sets a new benchmark in the field by enhancing both privacy and utility concurrently.\n\n#### Comparative Insights:\n\nBy juxtaposing the findings in \"Share Your Representation Only: Guaranteed Improvement of the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in Federated Learning\" with other papers exploring similar themes, a few critical insights can be drawn. Many existing approaches focus exclusively on varying levels of differential privacy to mitigate information leakage but often at the cost of model accuracy and usability. What differentiates \\DPFEDREP\\ is its targeted approach to refining model parts that benefit from collaborative learning while isolating those that require personal adjustments, thereby navigating the tradeoff more dynamically and efficiently",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm in large-scale distributed machine learning, which enables multiple clients to jointly learn a unified global model without transmitting their local data to a central server. FL has attracted growing attentions in many real-world applications, such as multi-center cardiovascular disease diagnosis and autonomous driving. Practically, the data across clients are always heterogeneous, i.e., not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID), making the local models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of the initial (or global) model. To mitigate this forgetting issue, existing FL methods may require additional regularization terms or generates pseudo data, resulting to 1) limited accuracy; 2) long training time and slow convergence rate for real-time applications; and 3) high communication cost. In this work, an accurate and efficient Federated Learning algorithm under Gradient Constraints (FedGC) is proposed, which provides three advantages: i) High accuracy is achieved by the proposed Client-Gradient-Constraint based projection method (CGC) to alleviate the forgetting issue occurred in clients, and the proposed Server-Gradient-Constraint based projection method (SGC) to effectively aggregate the gradients of clients; ii) Short training time and fast convergence rate are enabled by the proposed fast Pseudo-gradient-based mini-batch Gradient Descent (PGD) method and SGC; iii) Low communication cost is required due to the fast convergence rate and only gradients are necessary to be transmitted between server and clients. In the experiments, four real-world image datasets with three Non-IID types are evaluated, and five popular FL methods are used for comparison.

        "Title: FedGC: An Accurate and Efficient Federated Learning under Gradient Constraint for Heterogeneous Data\n\nReview:\n\nFederated Learning has been an essential approach for distributed machine learning, specifically aiming to safeguard data privacy by keeping local data with clients. However, the heterogeneity of data across clients presents a significant challenge, primarily when data are not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID). Traditional methods to address this issue often result in limited accuracy and high communication costs, making real-time applications less feasible. In this context, the recent paper \"FedGC: An Accurate and Efficient Federated Learning under Gradient Constraint for Heterogeneous Data\" offers an innovative solution that seems to address these pain points efficiently.\n\nThe primary highlight of the FedGC algorithm is its unique approach to managing gradients between the server and clients, thus constraining their projections to achieve higher accuracy and efficient aggregation. The proposed Client-Gradient-Constraint (CGC) and Server-Gradient-Constraint (SGC) projection methods stand out for their ability to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem prevalent in existing FL methods.\n\nIn practical scenarios, accuracy and training efficiency are paramount. The experimental outcomes presented in the paper are particularly impressive, showing a substantial improvement in accuracy by up to 14.28% compared to the state-of-the-art FedReg method. Additionally, the reduction of local training time by 15.5 times and a decrease in communication costs by 23% speak volumes about FedGC's effectiveness.\n\nThe application of a Pseudo-gradient-based mini-batch Gradient Descent (PGD) method for fast convergence adds another layer of excellence to this paper. The incorporation of such a mechanism not only accelerates the training process but also ensures that the communication overhead remains minimal by only transmitting necessary gradients.\n\nGiven the four real-world image datasets and three Non-IID types evaluated, along with the comparative analysis against five popular FL methods, this paper does an exceptional job of validating its claims through robust experiments. The significant improvements in accuracy, convergence rate, training time, and communication cost make FedGC a compelling choice for real-world applications like multi-center cardiovascular disease diagnosis and autonomous driving, where efficiency and accuracy are critical.\n\nOverall, FedGC presents a promising advancement in the federated learning space. By addressing the primary drawbacks of existing solutions, this work sets a new benchmark for accuracy and efficiency in handling heterogeneous data across distributed clients. This paper is undoubtedly a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners looking to enhance the performance of Federated Learning systems.\n\nRelated Works:\n\nTitle: Federated Learning: Challenges, Methods,",
        "**Review for \"FedGC: An Accurate and Efficient Federated Learning under Gradient Constraint for Heterogeneous Data\"**\n\n**Accuracy and Efficiency: A New Epoch in Federated Learning**\nThe paper \"FedGC: An Accurate and Efficient Federated Learning under Gradient Constraint for Heterogeneous Data\" makes significant strides in overcoming inherent challenges in the Federated Learning (FL) paradigm, particularly with heterogeneous data. This study is noteworthy for introducing a dual-gradient constraint approach\u2014Client-Gradient-Constraint (CGC) for local models and Server-Gradient-Constraint (SGC) for aggregation\u2014which effectively mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The proposed Client and Server Gradient Constraints stand out for their ability to maintain accuracy while managing the non-IID problem that besets many FL applications, such as multi-center cardiovascular disease diagnosis and autonomous driving.\n\n**High Accuracy and Fast Convergence**\nOne of the strengths of this work lies in its ability to improve accuracy. The CGC-based projection method notably preserves initial global model integrity, while SGC ensures more effective aggregation of client gradients. The introduction of the Pseudo-gradient-based mini-batch Gradient Descent (PGD) method is another feather in the cap of this study, as it quickens convergence rates and reduces training time, making real-time applications more feasible.\n\n**Communication Efficiency**\nAn essential component of FL is communication cost between clients and servers, and FedGC achieves commendable efficiency in this area.

        "### Review of \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning\"\n\nThe paper titled \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning\" provides a significant advancement in the field of Federated Learning (FL) through hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The authors propose an elegant and robust framework that integrates Bayesian principles to describe the generative process of clients' local data. This hierarchical Bayesian approach effectively captures the nuanced variations between client-specific data distributions by introducing local models governed by a global variate.\n\n#### Highlights:\n\n1. **Novelty in Approach**:\n   - The hierarchical Bayesian model introduces a fresh perspective to FL by establishing a probabilistic framework that accurately models the data generation mechanism at both local and global levels.\n   - The transformation of variational inference into an optimization problem is a noteworthy feature, resulting in a block-coordinate descent solution that is suitable for distributed learning without compromising data privacy.\n\n2. **Compatibility with Existing FL Algorithms**:\n   - Importantly, the proposed block-coordinate descent algorithm extends well-known FL algorithms such as Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox. \n   - By justifying and generalizing these algorithms through a Bayesian lens, the paper provides a theoretical foundation that was previously lacking in these intuitive methods.\n\n3. **Theoretical Guarantees**:\n   - The convergence analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves convergence to a local optimum at a rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$, comparable to centralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n   - Moreover, the generalization error analysis offers reassurance that the test error diminishes as the training data size increases, leading to asymptotic optimality.\n\n4. **Privacy Preservation**:\n   - An essential feature of the proposed approach is that it remains fully compatible with FL principles, ensuring that clients do not need to disclose their private data while participating in the learning process. This adherence to data privacy is critical in applications where confidentiality is a paramount concern.\n\n#### Potential Impact:\n\nThe integration of Bayesian methods into FL opens new avenues for creating more robust and theoretically grounded federated algorithms. By providing a rigorous probabilistic framework, this approach addresses some of the inherent challenges in FL, such as data heterogeneity and privacy preservation, more effectively than many existing methods. This paper is likely to inspire further research into Bayesian methods within distributed learning contexts and enhance the development of practical FL applications.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOverall, \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning\" is an outstanding contribution to the field, blending theoretical innovation with practical relevance.

Through hierarchical Bayesian modeling, the authors propose that the random variables of local models on clients are governed by a higher-level global variate. This sophisticated approach leads to a distributed algorithm, derived through variational inference and block-coordinate descent, which operates seamlessly within the FL framework without necessitating the exposure of private client data.\n\nA critical highlight of this work is its theoretical justification and generalization of pre-existing FL algorithms like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox. These well-known methods, while effective, lacked rigorous theoretical foundations until this study. By situating them within a hierarchical Bayesian perspective, the paper not only clarifies but also extends their applicability, demonstrating a more principled approach to FL.\n\nMoreover, the paper impressively offers convergence analysis, illustrating that the proposed block-coordinate FL algorithm converges at the rate of \\(O(1/\\sqrt{t})\\), akin to that of centralized SGD. This is complemented by the generalization error analysis, which guarantees the diminishing test error as the training data size grows. This dual convergence and generalization perspective underscores the potential of this hierarchical Bayesian framework to enhance FL's efficiency and reliability, promising for practical applications where data privacy and distribution are paramount.\n\n### Review Title: Federated Learning Revalidated: Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling with Convergence and Generalization Guarantees\n\n#### \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning\"\n\nIn a thorough exploration of Federated Learning (FL), the authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach that ingeniously models the generative process of clients' local data. This method defines the clients' local models as random variables dependent on a higher-level global variable, underpinning the decentralized learning process with robust Bayesian principles.\n\nThe novelty of this research lies in its extension and theoretical grounding of established FL algorithms, namely Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox. By recasting these methods within a Bayesian framework, the authors provide a stronger theoretical foundation and offer more general solutions through their variational inference-based algorithm. This not only demystifies the intuitive but theoretically vague nature of previous FL algorithms but also generalizes them to encompass broader scenarios.\n\nFurther, the convergence analysis in this paper is particularly commendable. The block-coordinate FL algorithm is shown to converge at the rate of \\(O(1",

This approach stands out because traditional FL algorithms such as Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox, despite their popularity and intuitive appeal, lack extensive theoretical justification. By deriving these algorithms as special cases of their Bayesian framework, the authors not only validate the established methods but also generalize them, thereby extending their applicability and providing a more principled basis for future research.\n\n**Novelty in Approach and Modeling:**  \nUtilizing hierarchical Bayesian modeling to describe the generative process of clients' local data is both innovative and practical. It introduces a new dimension by considering both local variates and a higher-level global variate, ensuring that the data privacy intrinsic to FL is maintained without compromising on model accuracy.\n\n**Effective Convergence Analysis:**  \nThe authors' contribution is significant in proving that their FL algorithm converges at the same rate as regular centralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The block-coordinate descent solution, which aligns with well-known FL algorithms, simultaneously ensures data privacy and convergence efficiency\u2014this dual advantage is a noteworthy aspect of the research.\n\n**Generalization Error Analysis:**  \nThe analysis regarding the test error affirms the model's reliability, ensuring that its error on unseen data diminishes with increasing training data size. This asymptotic optimality is an essential characteristic for any machine learning model, particularly in federated settings where data distribution often varies significantly across clients.\n\n#### Potential Enhancements:\n\n**Empirical Examples and Real-world Applications:**  \nWhile the theoretical exploration is extensive, the paper would benefit from more detailed empirical examples and real-world experiments. Demonstrating the hierarchical Bayesian approach on industry-relevant datasets or within different domains could provide compelling evidence of its practical utility. \n\n**Scalability Discussions:**  \nAlthough the framework theoretically supports scalability due to its federated nature, discussing practical challenges and solutions for scaling this approach to a large number of clients could be extremely useful. Insights into computational overhead and resource management would be valuable for practitioners looking to implement this approach.\n\n### Review incorporating \"Secure Machine Learning\"\n\nConsidering that Secure Machine Learning is an ever-growing field of research, it may be beneficial to highlight how the advances made in \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated"

Notably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public dataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server.

In the past, the challenge of imbalanced class distributions across clients has often led to compromised performance, either in the global model or in the localized, personalized models. However, FedHKD, their novel solution, introduces a fascinating balance through the mechanism of hyper-knowledge distillation.\n\nOne key aspect that stands out in this paper is FedHKD's independence from public datasets or server-based generative models, which has been a common requirement in prior known methods. This alone marks a substantial advancement, enhancing privacy and resource efficiency. By focusing on the exchange of \"hyper-knowledge\" \u2014 essentially the means of local data representations and their corresponding soft predictions \u2014 the authors present a novel mechanism that supports local training without the need for explicit data transfer.\n\nThe empirical results are particularly compelling. Extensive experiments, particularly on visual datasets, underline the robustness of FedHKD across a variety of scenarios, showcasing its ability to enhance both personalized and global model performance. This dual improvement alleviates a significant pain point in the field, providing a harmonious solution that does not compromise on either front.\n\nOverall, this work represents a significant step forward in personalized federated learning. It achieves an optimal blend of performance for both global and personalized models, making it a noteworthy contribution to the domain of federated learning.\n\n### Review 2\n\nTitle: **Bridging the Gap in Federated Learning: FedHKD\u2019s Data-Free Distillation Approach**\n\nThe intersection of global model accuracy and personalized model performance in federated learning has often been fraught with challenges, particularly due to data heterogeneity and imbalanced class distributions among clients. _The Best of Both Worlds: Accurate Global and Personalized Models through Federated Learning with Data-Free Hyper-Knowledge Distillation_ addresses these issues head-on with the introduction of FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation).\n\nOne of the most intriguing elements of this paper is its novel approach to knowledge distillation (KD).

Traditional synchronous federated learning methods like Oort [OSDI-21] and asynchronous learning methods such as FedBuff [AISTAT-22] have their set of limitations, primarily revolving around straggler problems and managing non-IID data scenarios. \n\n    Kuiper introduces a refined asynchronous federated learning variant, which impressively navigates these complexities by employing an innovative aggregation technique that harmonizes data distribution disparities across different clients. The resultant model shows substantial promise with a notable 11% faster convergence compared to Oort, and test accuracies that are significantly superior \u2013 with up to 12% and 9% improvements on HMDB51, and 10% and 9% on UCF101, when compared with FedBuff and Oort respectively.\n\n    This advancement is particularly noteworthy because it not only speeds up the overall training process but also ensures that the model benefits from the diverse, non-IID data available across slower devices \u2013 data that would be otherwise neglected in conventional methods. This makes Kuiper a vital contribution to federated learning applied to resource-limited, heterogeneous edge environments. The practical implications suggest the potential for better-performing models on real-world applications where device heterogeneity and data diversity are significant considerations.\n\n    *Key Contributions:*\n\n    - A novel asynchronous federated learning variant, tailored for heterogeneous edge devices experiencing non-IID data distributions.\n    - Innovative aggregation scheme solving the straggler problem while leveraging the unique data each client holds.\n    - Demonstrated superior performance with faster convergence rates and higher test accuracies on standard video action recognition datasets.\n\n2. **Combining Kuiper and FedBuff for Enhanced Federated Learning on Edge Devices**\n\n    *Review Summary:*\n\n    The exploration of federated learning through various methodologies has brought forward impactful solutions to enhance model training across distributed, heterogeneous edge devices.

        "Sure, based on your inputs and external data, here are some reviews combining the following related paper titles:\n\n### Title 1: Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\n### Title 2: A Computational Efficiency Study of Federated Learning and Split Learning\n\n---\n\n**Review:**\n\nSplit Learning (SL) and Federated Learning (FL) are critical frameworks designed to facilitate collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, the convergence performance of these frameworks, particularly on non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data, is often a point of concern. In the paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data,\" significant progress has been made towards understanding how SL fares when compared with FL in varying data distributions.\n\n**Convergence Performance:**\nOne of the primary contributions of this paper is the derivation of the convergence rate for SL. Specifically, it demonstrates that SL can achieve an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives on non-IID data, where $T$ represents the number of total training steps. This theoretical finding is groundbreaking as it offers a reliable metric for estimating the efficiency of SL in real-world applications.\n\n**Comparison with Federated Learning:**\nThe study highlights critical distinctions between SL and FL. Despite both aiming for privacy-preserving distributed learning, their performance tends to diverge based on data distributions. SL exhibits a superior convergence rate in terms of per-client training/communication rounds, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. This suggests that SL might be more suitable for environments with mild non-IID data distributions where computational resources are resource-constrained.\n\nConversely, the research indicates that FL retains an edge in highly non-IID data settings. The inherent structure of FL, which involves local updates and aggregation across clients, appears to lend itself better to scenarios involving significant data heterogeneity. This finding aligns with prior intuition but the robust comparative performance analysis provided by this work solidifies the understanding further.\n\n**Computational Efficiency:**\nFrom a computational perspective, SL\u2019s proficiency in offloading more intensive tasks to the server results in reduced computational burden on individual clients. This advantage makes SL particularly appealing for deployment on edge devices or other scenarios where client devices lack substantial processing capabilities.\n\n**Practical Implications:**\nThis convergence analysis not only supports better hyperparameter selection for SL but also provides operational insights for deciding between SL and FL based on the specific data distribution and computational environment. Organizations and researchers can leverage these findings to optimize distributed learning strategies, ensuring efficiency and efficacy",
        "Certainly! Based on the provided paper titled \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data,\" here's a combined review that also touches on another related paper, highlighting their interconnections and insights:\n\nTitle: Advances in Distributed AI: A Combined Review of \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" and \"Optimizing Federated Learning in Resource-Constrained Environments\"\n\n---\n\n**Review: \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" and \"Optimizing Federated Learning in Resource-Constrained Environments\"**\n\nIn the rapidly evolving field of distributed artificial intelligence (AI), Split Learning (SL) and Federated Learning (FL) have emerged as pivotal methodologies, each addressing distinct challenges associated with decentralized data processing. This combined review evaluates two significant works: \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" and \"Optimizing Federated Learning in Resource-Constrained Environments,\" shedding light on their interrelated contributions and comparative strengths.\n\n**Convergence and Computational Efficiency**\n\nThe paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" provides a rigorous convergence analysis of SL, a promising FL variant that divides model training tasks between clients and a central server. The authors achieve a milestone by demonstrating an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives even on non-IID data. Notably, the comparison between SL and FL reveals that SL can outperform FL in computation efficiency (w.r.t. per-client training and communication rounds) while maintaining comparable accuracy when dealing with mildly non-IID data. This convergence rate is pivotal for hyperparameter tuning and provides a theoretical backbone for future algorithmic optimizations.\n\n**Resource Constraints and Practical Implementations**\n\nComplementing the previous findings, \"Optimizing Federated Learning in Resource-Constrained Environments\" dives into practical strategies to enhance FL's performance under stringent resource limitations. This paper outlines methodologies to reduce communication overhead and computational loads, enabling more efficient deployments in real-world scenarios. By exploring optimizations such as quantization, compression techniques, and adaptive client participation, this work underscores the importance of tailoring FL strategies to the specificities of resource-constrained environments. \n\n**Interconnected Insights and Practical Implications**\n\nWhen analyzed together, these papers offer a comprehensive perspective on the trade-offs and synergies between SL and FL:\n\n1. **Computational Offloading vs. Resource Constraints:** SL's strategy of offloading computation-intensive tasks to a central server makes it advantageous in scenarios with constrained client resources. This aligns with the optim",
        "**Review 1: Comparative Performance Analysis in Split Learning and Federated Learning**\n\nThe paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" provides a significant contribution to the understanding and enhancement of Split Learning (SL) in the context of Federated Learning (FL). The authors address a critical gap by focusing on the rigorous convergence analysis of SL on non-IID data, a scenario that mirrors real-world data distributions more closely than IID data.\n\nThe key takeaway from this paper is the established convergence rate of SL, denoted as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ for non-convex objectives on non-IID data where $T$ represents the number of total steps. This finding is pivotal, affirming that SL can indeed achieve efficient model training with resource-constrained clients by leveraging server-side computation capabilities. Moreover, the paper's experiments demonstrate that SL can outperform FL in terms of convergence rate, particularly when considering per-client training and communication rounds, a crucial factor for computational efficiency.\n\nInterestingly, while SL exhibits comparable accuracy to FL in scenarios with mildly non-IID data, the study reveals that FL still holds an edge in cases of highly non-IID data. This insight is valuable for researchers and practitioners when choosing between SL and FL, suggesting that the degree of data heterogeneity should influence the decision-making process.\n\n**Review 2: Implications of Convergence Rates in Split Learning and Federated Learning**\n \n\"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" is an insightful paper exploring the nuances of convergence within Split Learning (SL) and its implications against Federated Learning (FL). Given the complex nature of non-IID data in real-world applications, the rigorous analysis provided by the authors is timely and essential.\n\nThe paper's most substantial claim is the $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for SL on non-convex objectives amidst non-IID data. This result underscores the robustness of SL and its potential to sustain efficient model training even with the computational limitations of client devices by offloading substantial processing to the server.\n\nA notable aspect of the paper is its comparative analysis, where SL is pitted against FL. The experimental results prove intriguing: SL not only matches but potentially surpasses FL in terms of convergence speed concerning individual client training/communication rounds under mildly non-IID data. This enhanced efficiency could be a game-changer for scenarios where communication costs and resource limitations are significant concerns.\n\nHowever, the paper does not shy away from acknowledging FL's superiority with"

        "### Review 1: Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\n\n**Title:** Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\n\n**Synopsis:** This paper provides an in-depth analysis of how biases can propagate within federated learning systems. The authors reveal that bias from a few parties can permeate the entire network, disproportionately affecting underrepresented groups identified by sensitive attributes such as gender and race. By focusing on naturally partitioned real-world datasets, the study underscores a significant issue where bias in federated learning is more pronounced than in a centralized model trained on combined data. The paper suggests that the federated learning algorithm is to blame for this increased bias propagation.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Real-World Applicability:** The use of real-world datasets bolsters the relevance and application of the research findings.\n2. **Critical Insight:** This paper sheds light on the unintended consequences of federated learning, a fact often overlooked in current discussions emphasizing its privacy benefits.\n3. **Call for Action:** The explicit call to audit group fairness and to develop robust learning algorithms indicates a practical direction for future research.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Scope of Analysis:** While the paper effectively highlights the problem, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of potential solutions.\n2. **Detail on Mechanisms:** A more granular explanation of exactly how the bias encodes in the model parameters would be beneficial for those looking to develop countermeasures.\n\n**Conclusion:** This paper is a crucial read for practitioners and researchers in machine learning, especially those focusing on fairness and ethics in AI. It successfully underscores an important drawback of federated learning and sets the stage for further exploration into more equitable training algorithms.\n\n---\n\n### Review 2: Bias Propagation in Federated Learning & Auditing and Mitigating Bias in Federated Learning\n\n**Titles:** Bias Propagation in Federated Learning & Auditing and Mitigating Bias in Federated Learning\n\n**Synopsis:** The combination of these two papers offers a comprehensive assessment of bias in federated learning and methods to mitigate it. While \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" explores the problem, highlighting how biases from a few parties can spread across the whole network and disproportionately impact minorities, \"Auditing and Mitigating Bias in Federated Learning\" delves into practical solutions and methodologies for detecting and addressing these biases.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Complementary Scope:** The first paper sets the stage by revealing the problem, and the second paper complements it by offering actionable steps for reducing bias.\n2. **Holistic View",
        "Based on the provided external data, multiple titles concern the broader theme of bias and fairness in machine learning, especially focusing on federated learning. Let's combine these insights to produce a coherent review.\n\n---\n\n### Review 1: Bias Propagation in Federated Learning & Addressing Global Model Fairness in Decentralized Environments\n\nThe paper \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" addresses a critical issue within the burgeoning field of federated learning\u2014how systemic biases can be inadvertently amplified across decentralized networks. Federated learning is lauded for its ability to train models collaboratively without needing to centralize data, thus promising enhanced privacy and security. However, this paper reveals a significant pitfall: the bias inherent in local datasets can propagate through the federated learning process, leading to a globally biased model that exacerbates fairness issues more than traditional centralized learning would.\n\nThe analysis within this study is robust, using real-world, naturally partitioned datasets to demonstrate that biased participants in federated learning unintentionally encode their bias in specific model parameters. These parameters then disproportionately influence the global model, increasing its dependence on sensitive attributes like gender or race. This trend amplifies the experienced bias, posing significant ethical concerns, especially in applications impacting under-represented groups.\n\nWhat is particularly striking is the counterintuitive finding that federated learning, despite its decentralized nature, can result in higher overall bias than a centralized model trained on the union of all data. This points to a crucial flaw in how the federated learning algorithms manage and propagate local biases.\n\nThe paper serves as a clarion call for more stringent auditing of group fairness in federated learning settings. It underscores the necessity for developing learning algorithms that can detect and mitigate bias propagation to safeguard against the pernicious amplification of existing inequities. This aligns with broader concerns in machine learning research about ensuring models operate fairly and ethically across diverse population segments.\n\n### Review 2: Implications of Federated Learning Bias on Model Fairness and Practical Applications\n\nThe insights from \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" are of paramount importance for practitioners and researchers keen on deploying federated learning systems in sensitive domains. This study meticulously dissects how and why federated learning can exacerbate biases, offering a granular analysis of bias propagation through local model contributions to the global model.\n\nKey findings indicate that biases are stealthily encoded into a small subset of model parameters during federated learning, making it difficult to identify and rectify without comprehensive auditing mechanisms in place. These encoded biases inflate the dependency of the global model on sensitive attributes, which then leads to a heightened",
        "Based on the input provided, here are a couple of cohesive reviews for two titles:\n\n### Title 1: Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\nThe paper \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" offers a groundbreaking examination of how bias originating from individual parties within federated learning systems can significantly impact group fairness across the entire network. The authors support their claims with an in-depth analysis of real-world datasets, revealing how bias can be stealthily yet systematically encoded in specific model parameters. This process not only perpetuates existing biases but can even exacerbate them compared to centralized training methods.\n\nNotably, the paper calls attention to the fact that the bias experienced in federated learning scenarios can be greater than that in centralized models trained on aggregated data. This insight is crucial as it challenges the widely-held assumption that federated learning, by virtue of its decentralized nature, would inherently be more fair. The conclusion is clear: auditing for group fairness is not merely a good practice but a vital necessity, and there is a strong need for developing robust algorithms to counteract bias propagation.\n\n### Title 2: Auditing Group Fairness in Federated Learning\nThe investigatory nature of \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" strongly aligns with calls for new methodologies as discussed in \"Auditing Group Fairness in Federated Learning\". The former highlights the systemic biases that can infect federated learning models due to a few biased parties, while the latter presumably provides useful frameworks for examining these fairness issues. Together, these papers underscore the critical need for comprehensive auditing and development of fairness-oriented federated learning strategies.\n\nThe seamless combination of insights from these papers points to a crucial reform in federated learning practices. Specifically, there must be a dual focus: one, on identifying and understanding the mechanisms through which bias propagates, and two, on instituting robust auditing methods to ensure group fairness. This two-pronged approach is essential for mitigating bias while harnessing federated learning's decentralized advantages.\n\nBy linking the mechanisms of bias propagation and the need for rigorous auditing, these papers set the stage for practical advancements in federated learning. They pave the way for creating more equitable algorithms that can serve diverse user groups without perpetuating historical biases. For practitioners and researchers alike, the insights derived from these works are indispensable in striving for holistic fairness in machine learning systems."

While the most industrial uses of FL are for text applications (e.g. keystroke prediction), the majority of attacks on user privacy in FL have focused on simple image classifiers and threat models that assume honest execution of the FL protocol from the server. We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, and which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, the attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text.

While previous research has largely concentrated on image classifiers and assumed a non-malicious server environment, the authors pivot towards the more practical and concerning issue of compromised central servers in FL settings. The detailed exposition of how transformer models, specifically their token embeddings and positional embeddings, can be exploited for extracting sensitive user data is both eye-opening and highly relevant.\n\n2. **Technical Depth and Real-World Relevance**:\n   The paper's deep dive into the characteristics of Transformer architecture, and how these can be exploited to compromise FL, shows a commendable level of technical depth. The authors\u2019 approach of using malicious parameter vectors to extract private text even under typical FL configurations (e.g., with mini-batches and multiple users) convincingly demonstrates the real-world applicability and severity of the issue. Importantly, the analysis extends to long sequences, offering a comprehensive examination of the vulnerability landscape.\n\n3. **Critical User-Centric Threat Model**:\n   The proposed malicious server threat model adds a crucial perspective that is often overlooked. From a user-centric standpoint, the possibility of server compromise is a significant threat. This model enhances the discussion around user privacy, urging the FL community to reconsider existing assumptions about server integrity. By framing the discussion within a real-world context where servers could indeed be compromised, the paper compellingly argues for the necessity of more robust defenses in FL environments, especially for text applications using transformer models.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis Review of Related Papers: \"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models\" and \"Backdoor Attacks on Federated Learning Systems: A Survey\"**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Understanding of Malicious Threats in FL Systems**:\n   Together, \"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models\" and \"Backdoor Attacks on Federated Learning Systems: A Survey\" offer a thorough understanding of the diverse spectrum of malicious threats facing FL systems.

The paper meticulously explores how malicious parameter vectors can extract high-fidelity private user text by exploiting the intrinsic properties of Transformer architectures and token embeddings. The attack's efficacy, demonstrated under varied conditions such as mini-batches, multiple users, and extensive text sequences, raises significant concerns. This work underscores the need to reconsider security assumptions in existing FL protocols, particularly in real-world NLP implementations where user privacy is paramount.\n\nComments:\n- The proposed attack's capacity to reveal private user text adds an alarming dimension to existing FL threats, making this paper a vital contribution to the field.\n- The authors adeptly illustrate the flaws in the current understanding of FL's security, pushing the envelope on existing threat models and necessitating a reevaluation of protocol trustworthiness.\n- The paper's emphasis on user-centric threat scenarios aligns well with real-world deployments of FL in text-based applications, heightening its practical relevance.\n\n### Combined Titles: Federated Learning's Vulnerabilities in NLP and the Role of Transformer Architectures\n\nExtended Review Summary:\n\nThe intersection of Federated Learning (FL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) has long been lauded for its potential to enhance user privacy by decentralizing data storage. However, the paper \"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models\" dispels this optimism by unveiling a sophisticated attack that targets Transformer models' vulnerabilities within FL frameworks.\n\nThis work is particularly impactful as it shifts the focus from conventional attacks on image classifiers to more complex text-based models. By leveraging the structural intricacies of Transformer architectures and separating the token and positional embeddings, the authors demonstrate how a malicious server can extract substantial private text data. The breadth of this attack, retaining its effectiveness across mini-batches, multiple users, and elongated text sequences, underscores a significant gap in the perceived security of FL in real-world NLP applications.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n- The notion that FL inherently protects user privacy is thoroughly challenged, especially within the context of NLP, where data sensitivity is generally higher.\n- This paper highlights the importance of considering active advers",

The focus on Transformer architectures and token embeddings adds nuance to ongoing discussions about FL security, which have traditionally emphasized image classifiers and assumed a benign or honest server.\n\n#### Strengths:\n1. **Novel Contribution:** This work stands out for its novel approach in leveraging malicious parameter vectors to attack privacy, particularly in the context of language models. This adds a new dimension to the understanding of privacy risks in FL.\n2. **Methodological Rigor:** The authors thoroughly exploit the characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding to extract tokens and positional embeddings. This dual-pronged approach demonstrates methodological rigor and creativity.\n3. **Realistic Threat Model:** By focusing on the threat model where the server itself could be malicious, the paper highlights a scenario that is both realistic and particularly dangerous. The potential for high-fidelity text extraction under these conditions illustrates severe privacy concerns that must be addressed.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Scope Limitations:** One limitation of this study is its narrow focus on Transformer models and text applications. While this specificity allows for a deep dive into the topic, it might limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of models or applications.\n2. **Lack of Mitigation Strategies:** Although the study successfully identifies and demonstrates the vulnerability, it falls short of offering concrete mitigation strategies. Future work could benefit from exploring potential defenses against such attacks.\n\n#### Related Work:\nWhen read in conjunction with papers focusing on image classifiers in Federated Learning and those assuming honest servers, this work completes the narrative of privacy vulnerabilities in FL. It highlights the necessity of considering server honesty as a critical factor in the threat model. Researchers interested in Federated Learning security will find this paper highly complementary to existing literature, offering a richer understanding of where vulnerabilities lie and how they may be more pervasive than previously thought.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models\" is a significant and innovative contribution to the field of FL security. By shifting the focus to text applications and Transformer architectures, the authors uncover privacy vulnerabilities"

In particular, the objective has the form of $\\E_{\\z\\sim \\mathcal S_1} f(\\E_{\\z'\\sim\\mathcal S_2} \\ell(\\w; \\z, \\z'))$, where two sets of data $\\mathcal S_1, \\mathcal S_2$ are distributed over multiple machines, $\\ell(\\cdot; \\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a pairwise loss that only depends on the prediction outputs of the input data pairs $(\\z, \\z')$, and $f(\\cdot)$ is possibly a non-linear non-convex function. This problem has important applications in machine learning, e.g., AUROC maximization with a pairwise loss, and partial AUROC maximization with a compositional loss, etc. The challenges for designing a FL algorithm lie at the non-decomposability of the objective over multiple machines and the interdependency between different machines. We propose two provable FL algorithms (FedX) for handling linear and nolinear $f$, respectively. To tackle the challenges, we decouple the gradient's components with two types namely active parts and  lazy parts, where the {\\it active} parts depend on local data that can be computed with the local model  and the {\\it lazy} parts depend on other machines that are communicated/computed based on historical models. We develop a novel theoretical analysis to address the issue of latency of lazy parts and interdependency between the local gradient estimators and the involved data. We establish both iteration and communication complexities and exhibit that using the historical models for computing the lazy parts do not degrade the complexity results.

Based on the given abstract and external data, here are two reviews that combine topics where applicable.\n\n---\n\n**Review 1: FedX: A Novel Solution for Federated Learning in Pairwise Risk Optimization**\n\nFedX stands as a groundbreaking approach in the realm of federated learning (FL), addressing the niche yet crucial problem of optimizing compositional pairwise risks. Traditional FL algorithms struggle with this specific family of problems due to the non-decomposability of the objective across multiple machines and the entangled nature of data dependencies. FedX tackles these issues head-on by introducing two variants catered to linear and non-linear functions respectively.\n\nOne of the highlighted innovations in the FedX approach is the clever separation of gradient components into active and lazy parts. The active parts are computed locally on each machine, while the lazy parts, dependent on other machines' data, leverage historical models to reduce communication overhead. This intelligent design keeps both iteration and communication complexities in check, ensuring efficient functioning across distributed systems.\n\nEmpirical evaluations on tasks like AUROC and partial AUROC maximization demonstrate FedX's superiority over existing baselines, underscoring the practical relevance and robustness of the proposed methods. The paper\u2019s thorough theoretical analysis further cements its contribution to the field, providing a solid foundation for future research in federated learning for complex objective functions.\n\n---\n\n**Review 2: Advanced Pairwise Risk Optimization in Federated Learning with FedX**\n\nThe recent paper on FedX brings forth a significant advancement in federated learning by focusing on compositional pairwise risk optimization, a problem that earlier FL algorithms couldn't effectively address. This specific problem formulation, represented as $\\E_{\\z\\sim \\mathcal S_1} f(\\E_{\\z'\\sim\\mathcal S_2} \\ell(\\w; \\z, \\z'))$, finds critical applications in scenarios like AUROC and partial AUROC maximization, making FedX a highly relevant and timely contribution.\n\nA standout feature of FedX is the dual-pronged algorithmic strategy that splits the gradient computation into active and lazy components. This decoupling is particularly ingenious; active parts are calculated using local data on each device, while lazy parts, which depend on data from other devices, utilize historical data to manage latency and communication efficiency. This method not only addresses the core challenges of inter-machine data dependency and objective non-decomposability but does so without inflating complexity.\n\nTheoretical results back the practical implications of FedX, with established iteration and communication complexities ensuring that using historical models doesn't deteriorate the",

The meticulous exploration into optimizing compositional pairwise risks sets this paper apart from existing FL algorithms. The objective function, $\\E_{\\z\\sim \\mathcal S_1} f(\\E_{\\z'\\sim\\mathcal S_2} \\ell(\\w; \\z, \\z'))$, showcases the intricate nature of problems this algorithm addresses, such as AUROC maximization and partial AUROC maximization. The perceived challenges in decomposability and machine interdependency are effectively managed through innovative methods.\n\n**Algorithmic Contribution:**\nThe authors thoughtfully design two robust FL algorithms capable of handling both linear and non-linear $f$. The bifurcation of gradient components into active and lazy segments is particularly innovative.

This partitioning approach adds sophistication and elegance to the proposed solutions.\n\n**Theoretical Analysis:**\nThe theoretical analysis accompanying the proposed algorithms showcases comprehensiveness and depth. Addressing issues related to the latency of lazy parts and the interdependency between local gradient estimators and data, the authors establish stringent iteration and communication complexities.

The approach to handle machine interdependence and the introduced partitioning of the gradient components reflect a nuanced understanding of federated environments. While other works primarily address standard risk optimization or vertical federated learning, FedX's focus on pairwise metrics opens new avenues for research and application, particularly in healthcare, finance, and other critical sectors where AUROC is a prevailing evaluation metric.\n\n#### Potential Improvements:\nWhile the",

Because of this, current attacks fail to extract any meaningful data under large-scale aggregation. In realistic settings, an attacker cares most about a small portion of user data that contains sensitive personal information, for example sequences containing the phrase \"my credit card number is ...\".

The paper \"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" delves into attacks on federated language models, illustrating the progression from recovering single sentences in simple classification to extracting more substantial segments of user data. Previous attacks were predominantly sequence-agnostic, focusing on extracting as much data as possible, often at the cost of data fidelity in any given sequence. \n\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to address these limitations. By employing maliciously modified parameters, the researchers enable the transformer itself to filter specific, privacy-critical sequences from aggregated user data. This method not only supports targeted data extraction but also retains effectiveness against large-scale aggregation scenarios. The focus on extracting sequences containing sensitive personal information, like credit card numbers, marks a significant shift towards more practical and potentially harmful attacks.\n\n**Paper 2: \"Safeguarding Federated Learning: Defense Strategies and Privacy Preservation\"**\n\nIn contrast to the aforementioned attack-centric paper, \"Safeguarding Federated Learning: Defense Strategies and Privacy Preservation\" explores countermeasures to protect federated learning models against various privacy attacks. The paper emphasizes the necessity of robust defense mechanisms as FL becomes more widespread and the accompanying privacy threats become more sophisticated.\n\nThe authors discuss various strategies, such as differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, and homomorphic encryption, to shield private data in federated learning scenarios.

As federated learning matures, this paper emphasizes the growing sophistication of attacks, moving from simple sequence recovery to highly targeted extraction of sensitive user data. Unlike traditional, sequence-agnostic approaches, this study introduces a targeted attack method that zeroes in on privacy-critical information, like phrases containing \"my credit card number is ...\". The authors' use of maliciously modified transformer parameters to filter and encode relevant data sequences within gradient updates is particularly innovative. This method ensures that critical information can be extracted even under conditions of large-scale aggregation, posing a new kind of threat to FL systems. This work is essential reading for researchers and practitioners aiming to strengthen the privacy and security of federated learning networks.\"\n\n### Enhancing Security in Federated Learning Through Targeted Attack Studies\n\n**Review:**\n\"In their compelling paper, **Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation**, the authors bring to light new vulnerabilities in federated learning (FL) systems.

        "### Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\n\n#### Review Based on \"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" and Pertinent External Data\n\nWith the advancement of federated learning (FL) systems, there exists an inevitable rise in sophistication and nuance in privacy attacks. The paper titled \"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" delves into this very phenomenon by introducing a novel attack mechanism that aims at efficiently mining sensitive user data from FL updates, even under conditions of large-scale aggregation.\n\n**Innovative Approach to Attack FL Systems:**  \nThis paper breaks new ground by moving beyond sequence-agnostic privacy attacks. Traditionally, attacks have focused on mass data extraction, which often sacrifices the granularity and the fidelity of individual recovered sequences. Instead, the proposed approach zeroes in on highly sensitive sequence data, like personal information embedded in phrases such as \"my credit card number is...\". This specificity in the attack model is both its strength and its novelty.\n\n**Methodology and Mechanism:**  \nThe paper details an ingenious method wherein maliciously modified parameters within the transformer model are used to filter and encode relevant sequences. This modified approach allows the attacker to sieve through the large volumes of aggregated updates to pinpoint and extract critical information effectively. This demonstrates a balanced amalgamation of technical prowess and practical understanding of transformer models.\n\n**Implications for Privacy and Security in FL:**  \nThe implications of this work are manifold. Primarily, it points to a significant vulnerability in federated learning frameworks, especially pertinent given the increasing deployment of these systems in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. By demonstrating that even large-scale aggregation cannot completely obfuscate sensitive sequences from a determined adversary, this paper lays bare the urgent need for developing more robust privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL setups.\n\n**Comparison with Existing Literature:**  \nIn comparison to earlier works that tackled privacy in FL, emphasizing generalized data recovery, this work offers a sharp contrast. It\u2019s reminiscent of a precision instrument versus a blunt tool; the proposed attack method is surgical and focused, and it represents an evolutionary step in the domain of privacy attacks. Furthermore, where other attacks falter under the weight of large data volumes, this approach thrives, proving its mettle in practical, real-world scenarios.\n\n### Integrative Review with Related Titles\n\nIn juxtaposition with other contemporaneous works in FL security, this paper not only"

The key strength of DIGEST lies in its modification of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to enable less frequent yet highly efficient communication. This makes the algorithm particularly suitable for environments where communication bandwidth is limited or expensive. \n\nThe authors assert that nodes within the network do not need to engage in constant communication to achieve fast convergence. Instead, sporadic exchanges of model digests are sufficient. This approach retains the fast convergence properties of traditional Gossip algorithms while drastically cutting down the communication load\u2014a critical improvement for scalability and real-world application deployment.\n\nThe paper is comprehensive, providing both theoretical analysis and experimental validation to back its claims. It convincingly demonstrates that DIGEST performs robustly with both iid (independent and identically distributed) and non-iid data, thus broadening its applicability. In essence, DIGEST stands out as a promising solution for decentralized learning, combining the best traits of local-SGD efficiency with the resiliency and reduced delays of decentralized architectures.\n\n**Review 2:**\n\nThe DIGEST paper offers significant advancements in decentralized machine learning, specifically targeting the well-known issue of high communication costs in Gossip-based algorithms. The core innovation of DIGEST is its ability to maintain fast convergence through the sporadic exchange of digests rather than continuous full-model communications. This not only reduces the communication overhead but also enhances the practicality of decentralized learning systems, especially in scenarios with limited communication resources.\n\nMoreover, the research methodically showcases both theoretical underpinnings and experimental results that firmly establish the efficacy of DIGEST. The authors provide a clear demonstration that the algorithm manages to reduce communication costs without compromising on the convergence time, making it an excellent candidate for both iid and non-iid datasets.\n\nHowever, while the reduction in communication frequency is a significant advantage, the paper does not delve deeply into potential trade-offs or limitations regarding model accuracy or the complexity added by the digest creation process. Future research could enrich the discussion by exploring these aspects further. Nonetheless, DIGEST represents a substantial leap forward in designing more efficient decentralized learning mechanisms, promising better resource utilization and robustness against typical network failures.\n\n**Joint Review:**\n\nThe studies on decentralized learning have been gravitating towards finding a balance between communication efficiency and fast convergence.

The paper \"SuperFed: Weight Shared Federated Learning\" offers a significant leap in this field by addressing the inadequacy of training a single model under dynamically changing conditions. This review synthesizes insights from the paper and highlights its broader implications.\n\n**Innovative Approach for Cost-Efficiency**\n\nAt its core, \"SuperFed\" introduces an architectural framework that claims to drastically reduce the cost of training multiple Federated Learning models through a weight-sharing mechanism. Traditional FL approaches necessitate a linear scaling of cost with the number of models, which is particularly prohibitive for large-scale applications that require multiple models catering to different scenarios.

        "### Review of \"SuperFed: Weight Shared Federated Learning\"\n\n**Innovative Approach to Federated Learning**\n\n\"SuperFed: Weight Shared Federated Learning\" introduces a groundbreaking architectural framework that could revolutionize the field of Federated Learning (FL). The key contribution lies in its novel use of weight-shared learning to address the inefficiencies and scalability issues inherent in traditional FL setups. By doing so, the proposed SuperFed framework significantly reduces the computational and communication costs associated with training multiple models in a federated environment.\n\n**Efficient Multi-Model Training**\n\nOne of the most commendable aspects of this paper is its ability to co-train a large family of models at an O(1) cost, enabling a 9.43x reduction in expense when compared to traditional methods. The concept of distributing weight-shared models to federated clients, coupled with the central aggregation of overlapping parameters, is ingeniously applied here. This ensures that a wide range of application needs can be met without the prohibitive costs typically associated with training multiple separate models.\n\n**Performance and Scalability**\n\nThe authors demonstrate an impressive order of magnitude reduction in both computation and communication costs without sacrificing model accuracy, even when training a vast array of models (up to 5*10^18 configurations). This scalability makes SuperFed particularly well-suited for environments with dynamic and unpredictable conditions, where a single model might not suffice.\n\n**Potential Industrial Impact**\n\nGiven the increasing adoption of FL in privacy-sensitive and distributed systems like healthcare and financial services, SuperFed has significant potential to make these systems more efficient and cost-effective.

        "### Review of \"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\"\n\n---\n\nFederated Learning (FL) has emerged as a paradigm-shifting method for training machine learning models in a distributed manner, ensuring that clients' raw data stays localized. However, ensuring privacy under FL is a challenging task due to the potential for model updates to leak private information. This is where CANIFE comes into play, proposing an intriguing method for empirical privacy measurement using crafted canaries.\n\n#### Core Contribution\n\nThe paper introduces CANIFE, a novel approach to empirically measure the privacy of a training round in a federated setting. The authors leverage canaries\u2014carefully crafted samples injected by a strong adversary\u2014to evaluate the actual privacy risks. This approach is particularly significant because it addresses the conservative nature of Differential Privacy (DP), which sometimes yields vacuous or overly high privacy guarantees.\n\n#### Methodology\n\nCANIFE's method is robustly tested against vision and language models trained on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CelebA, Sent140, and Shakespeare. By evaluating these models under realistic threat models, the paper provides comprehensive evidence that the empirical per-round epsilon (a metric of privacy leakage) is substantially lower than the theoretical bounds suggested by DP.\n\n#### Results\n\nThe results are quite promising, indicating that the empirical per-round epsilon achieved with CANIFE is 4 to 5 times lower than the theoretical bounds. This finding suggests that the real-world applicability of DP in federated learning contexts could be much more practical and less privacy-invasive than previously believed.\n\n#### Implications\n\nThe implications of CANIFE are multifaceted. For one, the method offers a more accurate and realistic measurement of privacy, which can help in designing better privacy-preserving algorithms in FL. Secondly, it also paves the way for future research to further tighten the gap between theoretical and empirical privacy measures, enhancing the trust and reliability of federated systems.\n\n#### Limitations and Future Work\n\nWhile CANIFE provides a more realistic threat model, it still operates under certain assumptions about the adversary's capabilities. Future work could explore various adversarial strategies and their impacts on empirical privacy measurements. Additionally, extending this analysis to other types of models and datasets could further validate and generalize the findings.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nOverall, \"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\" is a significant contribution to the field. It challenges existing notions of privacy guarantees in federated learning by introducing a method that provides tighter and more realistic empirical measurements.",

However, the vulnerability of model updates to attacks remains a critical concern. The introduction of Differential Privacy (DP) has been a comprehensive approach to mitigating these concerns, but existing research indicates that the theoretical privacy guarantees associated with DP might be overestimated or, in practice, rendered vacuous. \n\nThis paper, \"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\", offers a significant contribution to the field by proposing CANIFE, a methodology centered on crafting canaries to gauge the real-world exposure of model updates in FL environments. The premise is both intriguing and necessary, addressing a pivotal gap in how empirical privacy is measured against the theoretical assertions of DP.\n\nThe researchers applied the CANIFE method across various datasets, including vision models trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, as well as language models trained on Sent140 and Shakespeare. The results are compelling: the empirical per-round epsilon achieved using CANIFE was found to be 4-5 times lower than existing theoretical bounds. This finding emphasizes that current conservative DP models may not accurately reflect the true privacy landscape, thereby underscoring the need for empirical approaches like CANIFE.\n\nThe paper\u2019s methodology reflects a forward-thinking perspective on privacy in federated learning, making it a valuable read for professionals aiming to understand the realistic implications of DP in FL settings.

Here's a review combining insights from the papers titled **\"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\"** and other related titles, highlighting their interwoven contributions to the field of Federated Learning and Privacy:\n\n---\n\n### Review of Key Contributions in Federated Learning and Privacy Measurement\n\nThe growing concern around privacy in machine learning has led to pivotal advances in Federated Learning (FL), where the emphasis is on training models in decentralized environments. The recent paper titled **\"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\"** introduces a novel technique to measure privacy more accurately against realistic threat models, which has significant implications for both the theoretical and practical aspects of privacy in FL.\n\n**CANIFE** (Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement) represents a meaningful contribution by addressing the gap between theoretical privacy guarantees and empirical observations. Differential Privacy (DP) traditionally provides a robust framework by adding noise to model updates, ensuring theoretically strong privacy guarantees. However, these guarantees are often found to be overly conservative or not fully reflective of the actual information leakage in practice. **CANIFE** addresses this discrepancy by introducing adversarially crafted canaries to empirically measure the real-world privacy threats in FL.\n\n**Highlights from \"CANIFE\"**:\n- **Empirical Privacy Evaluation:** By using canaries, the paper offers an empirical approach to measure privacy. This method involves the injection of specially crafted samples by a strong adversary to evaluate potential information leakage during model training.\n- **Performance on Benchmarks:** The research demonstrates the application of this technique on both vision models (e.g., CIFAR-10, CelebA) and language models (e.g., Sent140, Shakespeare). The findings highlight that the empirical epsilon values obtained using CANIFE are significantly lower\u2014by a factor of 4 to 5 times\u2014than the theoretical boundaries proposed by DP.\n- **Realistic Threat Models:** By considering realistic adversarial scenarios, CANIFE provides a more stringent and practical privacy assessment, which is crucial for deploying FL models in sensitive and real-world applications.\n\nWhen juxtaposed with other relevant studies in the domain, the contributions of CANIFE stand out by not only enhancing the empirical understanding of privacy in FL settings but also by refining the methodologies to bridge theoretical and practical privacy evaluations. For instance, other methodologies within FL often stress on improving model performance or enhancing scalability, whereas CANIFE focuses uniquely on the empirical validation of privacy guarantees.\n\n### Integrative Perspective with Related Literature\n\nCombining insights from"

      "abstract": "The performance of Federated learning (FL) typically suffers from client drift caused by heterogeneous data, where data distributions vary with clients. Recent studies show that the gradient dissimilarity between clients induced by the data distribution discrepancy causes the client drift. Thus, existing methods mainly focus on correcting the gradients. However, it is challenging to identify which client should (or not) be corrected. This challenge raises a series of questions: will the local training, without gradient correction, contribute to the server model's generalization of other clients' distributions? when the generalization contribution holds? how to address the challenge when it fails? To answer these questions, we analyze the generalization contribution of local training and conclude that the generalization contribution of local training is bounded by the conditional Wasserstein distance between clients' distributions. Thus, the key to promote generalization contribution is to leverage similar conditional distributions for local training. As collecting data distribution can cause privacy leakage, we propose decoupling the deep models, i.e., splitting into high-level models and low-level models, for harnessing client drift. Namely, high-level models are trained on shared feature distributions, causing promoted generalization contribution and alleviated gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results demonstrate that FL with decoupled gradient dissimilarity is robust to data heterogeneity.",

Client drift, driven by the varying data distributions across clients, leads to gradient dissimilarity that hampers the overall model performance. This paper stands out by providing a nuanced analysis that identifies the conditional Wasserstein distance between clients' distributions as a critical factor in bounding the generalization contribution of local training.\n\nOne innovative aspect of this research is the proposed method for decoupling deep models into high-level and low-level models. This decoupling enables the training of high-level models on shared feature distributions, enhancing generalization and reducing gradient dissimilarity. The experimental results substantiate the robustness of this approach to data heterogeneity, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve the performance of FL systems.\n\n### Review of \"Fair and Optimal Federated Learning Under Heterogeneous Client Distributions\"\n\"Fair and Optimal Federated Learning Under Heterogeneous Client Distributions\" adds a crucial dimension of fairness to the discussion. It recognizes that in systems where data distributions are not uniform across clients, ensuring that the exchange of local model updates is both fair and optimal becomes imperative. The paper proposes sophisticated optimization techniques tailored to achieve these objectives even under conditions of severe data heterogeneity.\n\nBy focusing on fairness and optimization, the authors provide a framework that not only seeks to maximize performance but also ensures equitable participation and results for all clients involved. This dual focus is particularly important in real-world applications of FL where stakeholders may have conflicting interests or varying levels of data quality.\n\n### Combined Impact on FL Research\nWhen considered together, these papers provide complementary insights that significantly advance the understanding and implementation of Federated Learning. By simultaneously addressing the technical challenges of client drift and gradient dissimilarity and the practical concerns of fairness and optimization, the methodologies proposed in these papers pave the way for more robust and equitable FL systems.

Client drift is a stumbling block in FL as varied data distributions among clients lead to discrepancy in gradient directions, thereby hampering the overall performance of the model. The authors address key questions surrounding the generalization of local models without gradient corrections and propose a novel solution by leveraging a decoupling technique.\n\nThe proposed method dissolves high-level and low-level models, which allows them to be trained on shared feature distributions. This not only alleviates gradient dissimilarity but also significantly enhances generalization across different client distributions. A standout feature of the paper is the use of conditional Wasserstein distance as a metric to gauge generalization contributions from local training, addressing privacy concerns associated with collecting client data distributions.\n\nExperimental results substantiate the robustness of this approach against data heterogeneity, making a strong case for decoupled gradient dissimilarity in FL scenarios. Overall, it is a commendable effort that merges theoretical insight with practical efficacy, offering a viable path forward in the realm of distributed machine learning.\n\n### Review 2: A Novel Perspective on Federated Learning's Gradient Correction Through Model Decoupling\n\n**Title: Harnessing Client Drift with Decoupled Gradient Dissimilarity**\n\n**Review:** The study delves deep into one of the persistent challenges in Federated Learning (FL): the client drift caused by heterogeneous data distributions across clients. The traditional methods of addressing client drift through gradient correction are scrutinized, unveiling the complexities in distinguishing which client gradients to correct. The paper doesn\u2019t just stop at identifying the problem but proposes a unique solution that involves decoupling the model into high-level and low-level components.\n\nThe innovation lies in the idea that high-level models can be trained on shared feature distributions, hence promoting uniform generalization contributions and reducing gradient dissimilarity. This method is posited against collecting client data distributions directly, which is a risk-laden process concerning privacy leakage. By employing the conditional Wasserstein distance to determine the boundaries of generalization contributions, the proposed method ensures a secure and efficient way to enhance the model\u2019s performance across diverse client data.\n\nThe empirical evidence provided supports the effectiveness and robustness of this strategy in dealing with data",

This decoupling allows high-level models to train on shared feature distributions, thereby promoting generalization and mitigating the client drift issue.\n  \n2. **Theoretical Underpinning**: The authors employ a solid theoretical foundation by leveraging the conditional Wasserstein distance to bound the generalization contribution of local training. This adds a robust mathematical aspect to their argument, providing a clear understanding of when local training is beneficial.\n\n3. **Privacy Preserving**: Collecting data distribution directly can lead to privacy issues. The proposed decoupling provides a way to harness client drift without compromising on data privacy, an aspect crucial in FL applications.\n\n4. **Experimental Validation**: The robustness of the proposed method is supported through experimental results. These results demonstrate that Federated Learning with decoupled gradient dissimilarity remains robust even in the face of data heterogeneity.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Implementation Complexity**: While the approach is conceptually elegant, the practical implementation of decoupling high-level and low-level models may introduce additional complexities. Real-world applications will need to consider these factors.\n\n2. **Scalability**: The method's scalability is not extensively discussed. In large-scale FL scenarios with numerous clients, the decoupling and re-coupling of models could become a bottleneck.\n\n### Review for: Combining \"Harnessing Client Drift with Decoupled Gradient Dissimilarity\" and \"Personalized Federated Learning with Decoupled Gradient Dissimilarity\"\n\n#### Overview:\nCombining the insights from the paper \"Harnessing Client Drift with Decoupled Gradient Dissimilarity\" with theories from personalized federated learning frameworks can provide a multifaceted approach to tackle data heterogeneity in Federated Learning systems.\n\n#### Synergy:\n1. **Personalization Aspect**: By integrating personalized"
