      "abstract": "Lexicographic multi-objective problems, which impose  a  lexicographic importance order over the objectives, arise in many real-life scenarios. Existing Reinforcement Learning work  directly addressing lexicographic tasks has been scarce. The few proposed approaches were all noted to be heuristics without theoretical guarantees as the Bellman equation is not applicable to them. Additionally, the practical applicability of these prior approaches also  suffers from various issues such as not being able to reach the goal state.  While some of these issues have been known before, in this work we investigate further shortcomings, and propose fixes for improving practical performance in many cases. We also present a  policy optimization approach using our Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm that has the potential to address these theoretical and practical concerns. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed algorithms on benchmark problems.",

      "abstract": "Feature engineering is widely acknowledged to be pivotal in tabular data analysis and prediction. Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) emerged to automate this process managed by experienced data scientists and engineers conventionally. In this area, most \u2014 if not all \u2014 prior work adopted an identical framework from the neural architecture search (NAS) method. While feasible, we posit that the NAS framework very much contradicts the way how human experts cope with the data since the inherent Markov decision process (MDP) setup differs. We point out that its data-unobserved setup consequentially results in an incapability to generalize across different datasets as well as also high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel AutoFE framework Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH), a pipeline mainly for feature generation and selection. Notably, FETCH is built on a brand-new data-driven MDP setup using the tabular dataset as the state fed into the policy network. Further, we posit that the crucial merit of FETCH is its transferability where the yielded policy network trained on a variety of datasets is indeed capable to enact feature engineering on unseen data, without requiring additional exploration. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer attempt to build a tabular data pre-training paradigm via AutoFE. Extensive experiments show that FETCH systematically surpasses the current state-of-the-art AutoFE methods and validates the transferability of AutoFE pre-training.",

However, these methods require biological implausible ingredients, such as the detailed storage of older experiences, and long periods of offline learning. The optimal way to learn and exploit word-models is still an open question.\nTaking inspiration from biology, we suggest that dreaming might be an efficient expedient to use an inner model. We propose a two-module (agent and model) neural network in which \"dreaming\" (living new experiences in a model-based simulated environment) significantly boosts learning. We also explore \"planning\", an online alternative to dreaming, that shows comparable performances. Importantly, our model does not require the detailed storage of experiences, and learns online the world-model. This is a key ingredient for biological plausibility and implementability (e.g., in neuromorphic hardware).",

      "abstract": "Recently, graph-based planning algorithms have gained much attention to solve goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: they provide a sequence of subgoals to reach the target-goal, and the agents learn to execute subgoal-conditioned policies. However, the sample-efficiency of such RL schemes still remains a challenge, particularly for long-horizon tasks.  To address this issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance. Unlike prior methods that only utilize graph-based planning in an execution phase, our method transfers knowledge from a planner along with a graph into policy learning. We empirically show that our method can significantly boost the sample-efficiency of the existing goal-conditioned RL methods under various long-horizon control tasks.",

      "title": "Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories",
      "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate and improve the generalization performance for reinforcement learning (RL) agents on the set of ``controllable'' states, where good policies exist on these states to achieve the goal. An RL agent that generally masters a task should reach its goal starting from any controllable state of the environment instead of memorizing a small set of trajectories. To practically evaluate this type of generalization, we propose relay evaluation, which starts the test agent from the middle of other independently well-trained stranger agents' trajectories. With extensive experimental evaluation, we show the prevalence of generalization failure on controllable states from stranger agents. For example, in the Humanoid environment, we observed that a well-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, with only 3.9\\% failure rate during regular testing, failed on 81.6\\% of the states generated by well-trained stranger PPO agents. To improve \"relay generalization,\" we propose a novel method called Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA), which will reset the environment to the agent's old states according to the Q function during training. After applying STA to the Soft Actor Critic's (SAC) training procedure, we reduced the failure rate of SAC under relay-evaluation by more than three times in most settings without impacting agent performance and increasing the needed number of environment interactions.

      "abstract": "Time series observations can be seen as realizations of an underlying dynamical system governed by rules that we typically do not know. For time series learning tasks we create our model using available data. Training on available realizations, where data is limited, often induces severe over-fitting thereby preventing generalization. To address this issue, we introduce a general recursive framework for time series augmentation, which we call the Recursive Interpolation Method (RIM). New augmented time series are generated using a recursive interpolation function from the original time series for use in training. We perform theoretical analysis to characterize the proposed RIM and to guarantee its performance under certain conditions. We apply RIM to diverse synthetic and real-world time series cases to achieve strong performance over non-augmented data on a variety of learning tasks. Our method is also computationally more efficient and leads to better performance when compared to state of the art time series data augmentation.\n",

In this work, we first point out that RL generalization is fundamentally different from the generalization in supervised learning, and fine-tuning on the target environment is necessary for good test performance. Therefore, we seek to answer the following question: how much can we expect pre-training over training environments to be helpful for efficient and effective fine-tuning? On one hand, we give a surprising result showing that asymptotically, the improvement from pre-training is at most a constant factor. On the other hand, we show that pre-training can be indeed helpful in the non-asymptotic regime by designing a policy collection-elimination (PCE) algorithm and proving a distribution-dependent regret bound that is independent of the state-action space. We hope our theoretical results can provide insight towards understanding pre-training and generalization in RL.",

      "abstract": "Favorable reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms should not only be able to synthesize controller for complex tasks, but also transfer across various such tasks. Classical model-free RL algorithms like Q-learning can be made stable, and has the potential to solve complicated tasks individually. However, rewards are key supervision signals in model-free approaches, making it challenging in general to transfer across multiple tasks with different reward functions. On the other hand, model-based RL algorithms, naturally transfers to various reward functions if the transition dynamics are learned well. Unfortunately, model-learning usually suffers from high dimensional observations and/or long horizons due to the challenges of compounding error. In this work, we propose a new way to transfer behaviors across problems with different reward functions that enjoy the best of both worlds. Specifically, we develop a model-free approach that implicitly learns the model without constructing the transition dynamics. This is achieved by using random features to generate reward functions in training, and incorporating model predictive control with open-loop policies in online planning. We show that the approach enables fast adaptation to problems with completely new reward functions, while scaling to high dimensional observations and long horizons. Moreover, our method can easily be trained on large offline datasets, and be quickly deployed on new tasks with good performance, making it more widely applicable than typical model-free and model-based RL methods. We evaluate the superior performance of our algorithm in a variety of RL and robotics domains.",

However, these self-supervised representation learning algorithms are designed to preserve global visual information, which may miss changes in visual information that are important for performing the task. To resolve this problem, self-supervised representation learning specifically designed for better preserving task relevant information is necessary. Following this idea, we introduce Temporal Change Sensitive Representation (TCSR), which is designed for reinforcement learning algorithms that have a latent dynamic model.

      "abstract": "Learning to evaluate and improve policies is a core problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Traditional RL algorithms learn a value function defined for a single policy. A recently explored competitive alternative is to learn a single value function for many policies. Here we combine the actor-critic architecture of Parameter-Based Value Functions and the policy embedding of Policy Evaluation Networks to learn a single value function for evaluating (and thus helping to improve) any policy represented by a deep neural network (NN). The method yields competitive experimental results. In continuous control problems with infinitely many states, our value function minimizes its prediction error by simultaneously learning a small set of  `probing states' and a mapping from actions produced in probing states to the policy's return. The method extracts crucial abstract knowledge about the environment in form of very few states sufficient to fully specify the behavior of many policies. A policy improves solely by changing actions in probing states, following the gradient of the value function's predictions. Surprisingly, it is possible to clone the behavior of a near-optimal policy in Swimmer-v3 and Hopper-v3 environments only by knowing how to act in 3 and 5 such learned states, respectively. Remarkably, our value function trained to evaluate NN policies is also invariant to changes of the policy architecture: we show that it allows for zero-shot learning of linear policies competitive with the best policy seen during training.",

      "abstract": "Controlling agents remotely with deep reinforcement learning~(DRL) in the real world is yet to come. One crucial stepping stone is to devise RL algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical RL methods usually require considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios, they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these issues, we propose  Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping~(DeFog), an offline RL algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping scenarios without online interaction. DeFog first randomly masks out data in the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show that DeFog outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like 90\\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in the regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and the Atari environments. Our approach offers a robust and deployable solution for controlling agents in real-world environments with limited or unreliable data.",

By leveraging offline datasets and explicitly modeling frame dropping, DeFog achieves state-of-the-art performance under severe frame drop rates.

By randomly masking out data in offline datasets and incorporating the time span of frame dropping as inputs, DeFog enables agents to learn robust policies without online interaction. The finetuning stage, which further boosts performance, is a clever addition. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of DeFog in both MuJoCo control benchmarks and Atari environments.

This is a crucial step towards deploying RL agents in real-world environments, where data corruption and sensor malfunctions are common. DeFog's ability to learn from offline datasets and adapt to frame dropping without online interaction is a game-changer. The empirical results, which show DeFog outperforming strong baselines under severe frame drop rates, are impressive and demonstrate the potential of this approach for real-world applications.\n\n**Review 2: A Step Towards Reliable RL in Real-World Environments**\n\nThe paper \"Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping\" addresses a critical challenge in RL: developing algorithms that can operate reliably in the presence of corrupted or missing data. The proposed DeFog algorithm is a significant step towards achieving this goal. By leveraging offline datasets and explicitly modeling frame dropping, DeFog enables agents to act robustly in scenarios where traditional RL methods fail. The results, which demonstrate DeFog's effectiveness in both MuJoCo control benchmarks and Atari environments, are promising and suggest that this approach could be a key component of reliable RL systems in real-world environments.\n\n**Review 3: Overcoming the Limitations of Traditional RL**\n\nTraditional RL methods are often brittle and require extensive online interaction data, which can be costly and unsafe to collect in real-world environments. The authors of \"Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping\" have proposed a novel solution to this problem: an offline RL algorithm that can learn from limited and unreliable data. DeFog's ability to adapt to frame dropping scenarios without online interaction is a significant advantage over traditional RL methods. The empirical results, which show DeFog outperforming strong baselines, demonstrate the potential of this approach for overcoming the limitations of traditional RL and enabling the deployment of RL agents in real-world environments.\n\n**Review 4: A New Frontier in Offline RL**\n\nThe paper \"Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping\" represents a significant advance in offline RL, a research area that has gained increasing attention in recent years.

Our algorithm, which we call MAD (on account of using the mean absolute deviation in the importance weighting calculation), has distributed data generators sampling multiple candidates per source sentence on worker nodes, while a central learner updates the policy. MAD depends crucially on two variance reduction strategies: (1) a conditional reward normalization method that ensures each source sentence has both positive and negative reward translation examples and (2) a new robust importance weighting scheme that acts as a conditional entropy regularizer. Experiments on a variety of translation tasks show that policies learned using the MAD algorithm perform very well when using both greedy decoding and beam search, and that the learned policies are sensitive to the specific reward used during training.",

      "abstract": "Extensive work has demonstrated that equivariant neural networks can significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization by enforcing an inductive bias in the network architecture. These applications typically assume that the domain symmetry is fully described by explicit transformations of the model inputs and outputs. However, many real-life applications contain only latent or partial symmetries which cannot be easily described by simple transformations of the input. In these cases, it is necessary to learn symmetry in the environment instead of imposing it mathematically on the network architecture. We discover, surprisingly, that imposing equivariance constraints that do not exactly match the domain symmetry is very helpful in learning the true symmetry in the environment. We differentiate between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints and show that while imposing incorrect symmetry can impede the model's performance, imposing extrinsic symmetry can actually improve performance. We demonstrate that an equivariant model can significantly outperform non-equivariant methods on domains with latent symmetries both in supervised learning and in reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation and control problems.",

      "abstract": "  While deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents have showcased strong results across many domains, a major concern is their inherent opaqueness and the safety of such systems in real-world use cases. To overcome these issues, we need agents that can quantify their uncertainty and detect out-of-distribution (OOD) states. Existing uncertainty estimation techniques, like Monte-Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles, have not seen widespread adoption in on-policy deep RL. We posit that this is due to two reasons: concepts like uncertainty and OOD states are not well defined compared to supervised learning, especially for on-policy RL methods.\n Secondly, available implementations and comparative studies for uncertainty estimation methods in RL have been limited. To overcome the first gap, we propose definitions of uncertainty and OOD for Actor-Critic RL algorithms, namely, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and present possible applicable measures. In particular, we discuss the concepts of value and policy uncertainty. The second point is addressed by implementing different uncertainty estimation methods and comparing them across a number of environments. The OOD detection performance is evaluated via a custom evaluation benchmark of in-distribution (ID) and OOD states for various RL environments. We identify a trade-off between reward and OOD detection performance. To overcome this, we formulate a Pareto optimization problem in which we simultaneously optimize for reward and OOD detection performance. We show experimentally that the recently proposed method of Masksembles strikes a favourable balance among the survey methods, enabling high-quality uncertainty estimation and OOD detection while matching the performance of original RL agents.",

By providing clear definitions of uncertainty and out-of-distribution (OOD) states, they pave the way for more reliable and safe RL systems. The comprehensive evaluation of various uncertainty estimation methods and the introduction of a custom benchmark for OOD detection are particularly impressive.

      "abstract": "By properly utilizing the learned environment model, model-based reinforcement learning methods can improve the sample efficiency for decision-making problems. Beyond using the learned environment model to train a policy, the success of MCTS-based methods shows that directly incorporating the learned environment model as a planner to make decisions might be more effective. However, when action space is of high dimension and continuous, directly planning according to the learned model is costly and non-trivial. Because of two challenges: (1) the infinite number of candidate actions and (2) the temporal dependency between actions in different timesteps. To address these challenges, inspired by Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) in optimal control theory, we design a novel Policy Optimization with Model Planning (POMP) algorithm, which incorporates a carefully designed Deep Differential Dynamic Programming (D3P) planner into the model-based RL framework. In D3P planner, (1) to effectively plan in the continuous action space, we construct a locally quadratic programming problem that uses a gradient-based optimization process to replace search. (2) To take the temporal dependency of actions at different timesteps into account, we leverage the updated and latest actions of previous timesteps (i.e., step $1, \\cdots, h-1$) to update the action of the current step (i.e., step $h$), instead of updating all actions simultaneously. We theoretically prove the convergence rate for our D3P planner and analyze the effect of the feedback term. In practice, to effectively apply the neural network based D3P planner in reinforcement learning, we leverage the policy network to initialize the action sequence and keep the action update conservative in the planning process. Experiments demonstrate that POMP consistently improves sample efficiency on widely used continuous control tasks. Our code is released at https://github.com/POMP-D3P/POMP-D3P. ",

For such applications, population-based approaches have proven effective. Methods such as Quality-Diversity deals with this by encouraging novel solutions and producing a diversity of behaviours. However, these methods are driven by either undirected sampling (i.e. mutations) or use approximated gradients (i.e. Evolution Strategies) in the parameter space, which makes them highly sample-inefficient. In this paper, we propose a model-based Quality-Diversity approach, relying on gradients and learning in imagination. Our approach optimizes all members of a population simultaneously to maintain both performance and diversity efficiently by leveraging the effectiveness of QD algorithms as good data generators to train deep models. We demonstrate that it maintains the divergent search capabilities of population-based approaches while significantly improving their sample efficiency (5 times faster) and quality of solutions (2 times more performant).",

This work has the potential to revolutionize the field of reinforcement learning and pave the way for large-scale foundation models.\n\n**4-star review**\n\"A Promising Approach to Option Discovery: HiT-MDP Shows Great Potential\"\n\nHiT-MDP is an innovative approach to option discovery that tackles the instability and inefficiency of the standard option framework. The authors' use of transformer-based embeddings and maximum-entropy policy gradient framework is a clever move that pays off in the experimental results. While the paper could benefit from more theoretical analysis and comparisons to other related works, the results are undeniably impressive. HiT-MDP's performance on infinite horizon environments is particularly noteworthy, and its potential for large-scale foundation models is exciting. Overall, a great contribution to the field of reinforcement learning.\n\n**3-star review**\n\"A Solid Contribution to Option Discovery: HiT-MDP Has Its Strengths and Weaknesses\"\n\nHiT-MDP is a well-written paper that proposes a novel approach to option discovery on MDPs. The authors' use of hidden temporal embeddings is an interesting idea, and the experimental results are promising. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons to other related works, such as [related paper 1] and [related paper 2]. Additionally, the theoretical analysis could be more comprehensive, and the authors could provide more insights into the limitations of their approach. Nevertheless, HiT-MDP is a solid contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, and its performance on infinite horizon environments is a notable achievement.\n\n**2-star review**\n\"A Good Start, But HiT-MDP Needs More Development\"\n\nWhile HiT-MDP is an interesting approach to option discovery, it feels like a work in progress. The authors' use of transformer-based embeddings is a good idea, but the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations and justifications. The experimental results are promising, but they are not comprehensive enough"

      "abstract": "The ability to effectively reuse prior knowledge is a key requirement when building general and flexible Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. \nSkill reuse is one of the most common approaches, but current methods have considerable limitations. For example, fine-tuning an existing policy frequently fails, as the policy can degrade rapidly early in training, particularly in sparse reward tasks. In a similar vein, distillation of expert behavior can lead to poor results when given sub-optimal experts. \nWe compare several common approaches for skill transfer on multiple domains and in several different transfer settings, including under changes in task and system dynamics. We identify how existing methods can fail and introduce an alternative approach which sidesteps some of these problems. \nOur approach learns to sequence existing temporally-abstract skills for exploration but learns the final policy directly from the raw experience. This conceptual split enables rapid adaptation and thus efficient data collection but without constraining the final solution. Our approach significantly outperforms many classical methods across a suite of evaluation tasks and we use a broad set of ablations to highlight the importance of different components of our method.",
