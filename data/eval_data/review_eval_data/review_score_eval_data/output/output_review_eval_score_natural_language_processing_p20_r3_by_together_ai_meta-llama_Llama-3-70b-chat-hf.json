      "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have achieved impressive results on multiple choice question answering (MCQA) tasks in the zero, one, and few-shot settings, they generally lag behind the MCQA state of the art (SOTA). MCQA tasks have traditionally been presented to LLMs like cloze tasks. An LLM is conditioned on a question (without the associated answer options) and its chosen option is the one assigned the highest probability after normalization (for length, etc.). A more natural prompting approach is to present the question and answer options to the LLM jointly and have it output the symbol (e.g., \u201cA\u201d) associated with its chosen answer option. This approach allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option representations on answer selection. For the natural approach to be effective, the LLM it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the symbols that represent them. The LLM needs what we term multiple choice symbol binding (MCSB) ability. This ability varies greatly by model. We show that a model with high MCSB ability performs much better with the natural approach than with the traditional approach across 20 diverse datasets and largely closes the gap with the SOTA, suggesting that the MCQA ability of LLMs has been previously underestimated.",

      "title": "Contextualized Generative Retrieval",
      "abstract": "The text retrieval task is mainly performed in two ways: the bi-encoder approach and the generative approach. The bi-encoder approach maps the document and query embeddings to common vector space and performs a nearest neighbor search. It stably shows high performance and efficiency across different domains but has an embedding space bottleneck as it interacts in L2 or inner product space. The generative retrieval model retrieves by generating a target sequence and overcomes the embedding space bottleneck by interacting in the parametric space. However, it fails to retrieve the information it has not seen during the training process as it depends solely on the information encoded in its own model parameters. To leverage the advantages of both approaches, we propose Contextualized Generative Retrieval model, which uses contextualized embeddings (output embeddings of a language model encoder) as vocab embeddings at the decoding step of generative retrieval. The model uses information encoded in both the non-parametric space of contextualized token embeddings and the parametric space of the generative retrieval model. Our approach of generative retrieval with contextualized vocab embeddings shows higher performance than generative retrieval with only vanilla vocab embeddings in the document retrieval task, an average of 6% higher performance in KILT (NQ, TQA) and 2X higher in NQ-320k, suggesting the benefits of using contextualized embedding in generative retrieval models.",

      "abstract": "The development of largely human-annotated benchmarks has driven the success of deep neural networks in various NLP tasks. These benchmarks are collected by aggregating decisions made by different annotators on the target task. Aggregating the annotated decisions via majority is still used as a common practice, despite its inevitable limitation from simple aggregation. In this paper, we establish a novel classification framework, based on task-specific human preference between a pair of samples, which provides an informative training signal to capture fine-grained and complementary task information through pair-wise comparison. Hence, it improves the existing instance-wise annotation system by enabling better task modeling from learning the relation between samples. Specifically, we propose a new multi-task learning framework, called prefer-to-classify (P2C), to effectively learn human preferences in addition to the given classification task.\nWe collect human preference signals in two ways: (1) extracting relative preferences implicitly from annotation records (for free) or (2) collecting subjective preferences explicitly from (paid) crowd workers. In various text classification tasks, we demonstrate that both extractive and subjective preferences are effective in improving the classifier with our preference learning framework. Interestingly, we found that subjective preference shows more significant improvements than extractive preference, revealing the effectiveness of explicit modeling of human preferences. Our code and preference dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance.",

Overall, this is a well-written and well-executed paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of NLP.\"\n\n**Review 4:**\n\"The authors of this paper propose a novel classification framework that leverages human preferences to improve text classification performance. The Prefer-to-Classify framework is based on task-specific human preference between a pair of samples, which provides a more informative training signal than traditional instance-wise annotation systems. The authors' use of both implicit and explicit human preference signals is a strength, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The paper is well-written and well-organized, with clear explanations of the proposed framework and experimental"

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) grow larger and more sophisticated, assessing their \"reasoning\" capabilities in natural language grows more challenging. Recent question answering (QA) benchmarks that attempt to assess reasoning are often limited by a narrow scope of covered situations and subject matters. We introduce WikiWhy, a QA dataset built around a novel auxiliary task: explaining why an answer is true in natural language. WikiWhy contains over 9,000 \"why\" question-answer-rationale triples, grounded on Wikipedia facts across a diverse set of topics. Each rationale is a set of supporting statements connecting the question to the answer. WikiWhy serves as a benchmark for the reasoning capabilities of LLMs because it demands rigorous explicit rationales for each answer to demonstrate the acquisition of implicit commonsense knowledge, which is unlikely to be easily memorized. GPT-3 baselines achieve only 38.7% human-evaluated correctness in the end-to-end answer & explain condition, leaving significant room for future improvements.",

      "abstract": "In multi-principal-agent alignment scenarios spanning governance, markets, diplomacy, and AI, it is infeasible to elicit every principal's view on all perspectives relevant to agent decisions. Elicitation inference optimization (EIO) aims to minimize the $n$ elicitations needed to approximate $N$ principal's views across $K$ perspectives. In this work, we demonstrate an EIO approach where data efficiency ($NK/n$) increases with scale. We introduce STUMP: an elicitation inference model which integrates an LLM with a latent factor model to enable learning transfer across samples, contexts, and languages.  Then, we characterize STUMP's performance on a set of elicitation primitives from which scalable elicitation (sampling) protocols can be constructed. Building from these results, we design and demonstrate two scalable elicitation protocols for STUMP where data efficiency grows boundlessly, scaling like $O(n)$ in the number of elicitations $n$. This makes it possible to obtain complex, high-dimensional preference signals spanning principal populations at any scale.",

Yet, its success puts the utility of future internet-derived datasets at potential risk, as model outputs begin to replace human annotations as a source of supervision. In this work, we formalize a system where interactions with one model are recorded as history and scraped as training data in the future. We then analyze its stability over time by tracking changes to a test-time bias statistic (e.g. gender bias of model predictions). We find that the degree of bias amplification is closely linked to whether the model\u2019s outputs behave like samples from the training distribution, a behavior which we characterize and define as consistent calibration. Experiments in three conditional prediction scenarios \u2013 image classification, visual role-labeling, and language generation \u2013 demonstrate that models that exhibit a sampling-like behavior are more calibrated and thus more stable. Based on this insight, we propose an intervention to help calibrate and stabilize unstable feedback systems.",

Nevertheless, introduced in recent progress of parameter-efficient tuning is a new paradigm that large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) can be adapted to specific tasks by optimizing a tiny proportion of parameters, which might hopefully change the game. We associate this new paradigm with the computational tractability of second-order optimizers and succeed in applying them to large PTMs that are from hundreds of millions to billions in scale. Beyond verifying their tractability, we further investigate the stability-influencing factors in the optimization process and propose accordingly a Newton-step-clipping approach in which we clip the update tensors rather than the gradients. This approach stabilizes the convergence by gating the magnitude of Newton steps along the optimization trajectories through the rugged landscapes of deep transformers. \nWe conduct extensive experiments across different downstream tasks, demonstrating that, when equipped with our Newton-step-clipping strategy, second-order optimizers, especially Kronecker-factored curvature approximation (K-FAC), can attain comparable and even superior results and faster convergence to those state-of-the-art bars implemented with AdamW.  Furthermore, we scale the model up to 3 billion parameters and validate the tractability and effectiveness of our method. This work is not only the first successful application of second-order optimization on such large-scale models but also sheds light on the possibility of further optimization-wise analysis on large-scale models in the future.",

This issue emerges from the pre-trained language models' learning process that heavily relies on spurious correlations, which work for the majority of training examples but do not hold in general. As a consequence, the models' performance drops substantially on out-of-distribution datasets. Previous studies proposed various solutions, including data augmentation and learning process improvement. In this paper, we present Mask-tuning, an approach that alleviates the impact of spurious correlations on the fine-tuning learning process. To achieve this goal, Mask-tuning integrates masked language training into the fine-tuning learning process. In this case, Mask-tuning perturbs the linguistic relation of downstream tasks' training examples and computes masked language training loss. Then, the perturbed examples are fed into fine-tuning process to be classified based on their ground-truth label and compute the fine-tuning training loss. Afterward, Mask-tuning loss-- a weighted aggregation of masked language model training loss and fine-tuning loss-- updates the masked language model and fine-tuning through training iterations. Extensive experiments show that Mask-tuning consistently improves the pre-trained language models' generalization on out-of-distribution datasets and enhances their performance on in-distribution datasets.

The goal of this kind of adversarial attack is to modify the input text to fool a classifier while maintaining the original meaning of the text. Although most existing adversarial attacks claim to fulfill the constraint of semantics preservation, careful scrutiny shows otherwise. We show that the problem lies in the text encoders used to determine the similarity of adversarial examples, specifically in the way they are trained. Unsupervised training methods make these encoders more susceptible to problems with antonym recognition. To overcome this, we introduce a simple, fully supervised sentence embedding technique called Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE). The results show that our solution minimizes the variation in the meaning of the adversarial examples generated. It also significantly improves the overall quality of adversarial examples, as confirmed by human evaluators. Furthermore, it can be used as a component in any existing attack to speed up its execution while maintaining similar attack success.",

The authors tackle the long-standing problem of semantics preservation in adversarial attacks, where existing methods often fail to maintain the original meaning of the text. By introducing the Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE), a fully supervised sentence embedding technique, the authors demonstrate a significant improvement in preserving the semantics of adversarial examples. The results are impressive, with human evaluators confirming the superior quality of the generated examples. This work has far-reaching implications for the development of more robust language models.\n\n**Review 2: A Critical Examination of Adversarial Attacks**\n\nThis paper provides a much-needed critique of existing adversarial attacks in NLP. The authors show that most attacks fail to preserve the original meaning of the text, despite claims to the contrary. By identifying the root cause of the problem in unsupervised text encoders, the authors propose a novel solution, the Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE). The results are convincing, with SPE outperforming existing methods in terms of semantics preservation. This work serves as a wake-up call for the NLP community, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation and development of adversarial attacks.\n\n**Review 3: A Step Towards More Robust Language Models**\n\nThe paper \"Preserving Semantics in Textual Adversarial Attacks\" takes a crucial step towards developing more robust language models. By introducing the Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE), the authors provide a simple yet effective solution to the problem of semantics preservation in adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate the potential of SPE to improve the quality of adversarial examples, which can in turn be used to train more robust language models. This work has significant implications for the development of AI systems that can withstand adversarial attacks.\n\n**Review 4: A Novel Approach to Sentence Embeddings**\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to sentence embeddings, which is a crucial component of adversarial attacks in NLP. The authors propose the Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE), a fully supervised sentence embedding technique that outperforms existing methods in terms of semantics preservation.

      "abstract": "Why do models often attend to salient words, and how does this evolve throughout training? We approximate model training as a two stage process: early on in training when the attention weights are uniform, the model learns to translate individual input word `i` to `o` if they co-occur frequently. Later, the model learns to attend to `i` while the correct output is o because it knows `i` translates to `o`. To formalize, we define a model property, Knowledge to Translate Individual Words (KTIW) (e.g. knowing that `i` translates to `o`), and claim that it drives the learning of the attention. This claim is supported by the fact that before the attention mechanism is learned, KTIW can be learned from word co-occurrence statistics, but not the other way around. Particularly, we can construct a training distribution that makes KTIW hard to learn, the learning of the attention fails, and the model cannot even learn the simple task of copying the input words to the output. Our approximation explains why models sometimes attend to salient words, and inspires a toy example where a multi-head attention model can overcome the above hard training distribution by improving learning dynamics rather than expressiveness. We end by discussing the limitation of our approximation framework and suggest future directions.",

      "abstract": "As more and more conversational and translation systems are deployed in production, it is essential to implement and develop effective control mechanisms to ensure their proper functioning and security. An essential component to ensure the safe behavior of the system is out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which aims to detect whether an input sample is statistically far from the training distribution. While OOD detection is a widely covered topic in classification tasks, it has received much less attention in text generation. This paper addresses the problem of OOD detection for machine translation and dialog generation from an operational perspective. Our contribution includes (i) RAINPROOF a Relative informAItioN Projection Out OF distribution detection framework and (ii) a more operational evaluation setting for OOD detection. Surprisingly, we find that OOD detection is not necessarily aligned with task-specific measures. The OOD detector may filter out samples that are well processed by the model and keep samples that are not, leading to weaker performance. Our results show that RAINPROOF breaks this curse and achieve good results in OOD detection while increasing system performance.",

      "abstract": "Effective training of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on large batches and long sequences for throughput and accuracy. To handle variable-length sequences on hardware accelerators, it is common practice to introduce padding tokens, so that all sequences in a batch have the same length. We show in this paper that the variation in sequence lengths in common NLP datasets is such that up to 50% of all tokens can be padding. In less common, but not extreme, cases (e.g. GLUE-COLA with sequence length 128), the ratio is up to 89%. Existing methods to address the resulting inefficiency are complicated by the need to avoid \"cross-contamination\" in self-attention, by a reduction in accuracy when sequence ordering information is lost, or by customized kernel implementations only valid for specific accelerators.\n\nThis paper introduces a new formalization of sequence packing in the context of the well-studied bin packing problem, and presents new algorithms based on this formulation which, for example, confer a 2x speedup for phase 2 pretraining in BERT while preserving downstream performance. We show how existing models can be adapted to ensure mathematical equivalence between the original and packed models, meaning that packed models can be trained with existing pre-training and fine-tuning practices.",

Since most summarization datasets do not come with gold labels indicating whether document sentences are summary-worthy, different labeling algorithms have been proposed to extrapolate oracle extracts for model training. In this work, we identify two flaws with the widely used greedy labeling approach: it delivers suboptimal and deterministic oracles. To alleviate both issues, we propose a simple yet effective labeling algorithm that creates soft, expectation-based sentence labels. We define a new learning objective for extractive summarization which incorporates learning signals from multiple oracle summaries and prove it is equivalent to estimating the oracle expectation for each document sentence. Without any architectural modifications, the proposed labeling scheme achieves superior performance on a variety of summarization benchmarks across domains and languages, in both supervised and zero-shot settings.",

By operating in the representation space, their SimgReg method encourages models to learn debiased internal representations, rather than simply down-weighing biased examples. This approach shows promising results, improving out-of-distribution (OOD) performance while reducing bias in internal model components. The experiments on three NLU tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SimgReg, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n**Review 2: A Step Forward in Debiasing NLU Models**\n\nRecent studies have revealed that traditional debiasing methods may not be as effective as previously thought, with internal model representations often becoming more biased. The authors of \"Learning from Others\" address this issue with SimgReg, a similarity-based regularization method that targets debiasing in the representation space. By encouraging models to learn representations similar to unbiased models or different from biased models, SimgReg shows improved OOD performance and reduced bias in internal representations. This work builds upon previous research (e.g., [1], [2]) and offers a promising solution for mitigating artifacts in NLU models.\n\n**Review 3: Debiasing NLU Models with Representation Space Regularization**\n\nThe paper \"Learning from Others\" presents a novel approach to debiasing NLU models by regularizing the representation space. The authors' SimgReg method leverages similarity-based regularization to encourage models to learn debiased internal representations. This approach is particularly interesting in light of recent findings that traditional debiasing methods may not be effective in reducing bias in internal model components. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SimgReg in improving OOD performance and reducing bias, making it a valuable contribution to the field of NLU.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] \"Debiasing Pre-trained Language Models\" by [Author et al.]\n[2] \"Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Natural Language Understanding\" by [Author et al.]\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to generate more reviews or modify these in any way!",

Selective prediction, in which models abstain on low-confidence examples, provides a possible solution, but existing models are often overly confident on OOD examples. To remedy this overconfidence, we introduce Contrastive Novelty Learning (CNL), a two-step method that generates OOD examples representative of novel classes, then trains to decrease confidence on them. First, we generate OOD examples by prompting a large language model twice: we prompt it to enumerate novel classes relevant to the label set, then generate examples from each novel class matching the task format. Second, we train our classifier with a novel contrastive objective that encourages lower confidence on generated OOD examples than training examples. When trained with CNL, classifiers improve in their ability to detect and abstain on OOD examples over prior methods by an average of 2.3% AUAC and 5.5% AUROC across 4 NLP datasets, with no cost to in-distribution accuracy.",

This work is particularly noteworthy for its use of large language models to generate OOD examples, which could have far-reaching implications for the development of more robust and generalizable NLP models.\n\n**Review 3: A Step Towards More Reliable Text Classification**\n\nThe authors of \"Contrastive Novelty Learning: Anticipating Outliers with Large Language Models\" have taken a significant step towards developing more reliable text classification models.

By introducing Contrastive Novelty Learning (CNL), a two-step method that generates out-of-distribution (OOD) examples and trains classifiers to decrease confidence on them, they have achieved impressive results in detecting and abstaining on OOD examples. The 2.3% AUAC and 5.5% AUROC improvements over prior methods across four NLP datasets are a testament to the effectiveness of CNL. This work has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach text classification and selective prediction.\n\n**Review 2: A Novel Approach to Overcoming Overconfidence**\n\nOne of the major challenges in text classification is the overconfidence of models on out-of-distribution examples. The authors of \"Contrastive Novelty Learning\" have tackled this problem head-on by proposing a novel contrastive objective that encourages lower confidence on generated OOD examples than training examples. By leveraging large language models to generate OOD examples, CNL provides a robust solution to the problem of overconfidence. The results are impressive, with no cost to in-distribution accuracy. This work is a significant step forward in developing more reliable and accurate text classification models.\n\n**Review 3: A Promising Direction for Selective Prediction**\n\nSelective prediction, which involves models abstaining on low-confidence examples, is a crucial aspect of text classification. However, existing models often struggle to detect out-of-distribution examples. The authors of \"Contrastive Novelty Learning\" have proposed a promising solution to this problem by introducing a two-step method that generates OOD examples and trains classifiers to decrease confidence on them. The results are encouraging, with significant improvements over prior methods. This work opens up new avenues for research in selective prediction and has the potential to lead to more accurate and reliable text classification models.\n\n**Review 4: A Step Towards More Robust Text Classification Models**\n\nThe authors of \"Contrastive Novelty Learning\" have made a significant contribution to the development of more robust text classification models. By generating OOD examples that are representative of novel classes and training classifiers to decrease confidence on them, CNL provides a robust solution to the problem of overconfidence.

      "abstract": "Language models significantly benefit from context tokens, such as prompts or scratchpads. They perform better when prompted with concrete training examples and abstract statements about the target task (instructions), and they acquire new capabilities to perform complex tasks by generating step-by-step reasoning (scratch-pad) before predicting the final answers. However, they do not internalize these performance gains, which disappear when the context tokens are gone. Consequently, we always need to pay extra computation for this gain, and it is unclear how to transfer the capabilities acquired by context tokens to other tasks, or how to leverage the context tokens when their length exceeds the context window size. Our work proposes to apply context distillation so that a language model can internalize these gains. Concretely, given an input for the target task, we let the model use all relevant context tokens to generate the output, using ``[instructions] + [task-input]'' to predict ``[scratch-pad] + [final answer]''; then we fine-tune the same model to predict the above ``[final answer]'' conditioned on the ``[task-input]'', without seeing the ``[instructions]'' or using the ``[scratch-pad]''. This incentivizes the model to behave as if the context were present, hence updating the parameters to internalize the context information. We show that context distillation can be used as a general method for learning. In particular, we demonstrate that context distillation can effectively internalize 3 types of contexts: 1) abstract task instructions and natural language explanations of why an output is correct or incorrect on Natural-Instructions-V2; 2) step-by-step reasoning on 8-digit addition questions, where we show the model can apply this newly acquired capability to downstream question answering tasks; and 3) concrete training examples on the SPIDER Text-to-SQL dataset, where context distillation outperforms directly learning with gradient descent by 7%.",

      "abstract": "In the mode connectivity literature, it is widely accepted that there are common circumstances in which two neural networks, trained similarly on the same data, will maintain loss when interpolated in the weight space. In particular, transfer learning is presumed to ensure the necessary conditions for linear mode connectivity across training runs. In contrast to existing results from image classification, we find that among text classifiers (trained on MNLI, QQP, and CoLA), some pairs of finetuned models have large barriers of increasing loss on the linear paths between them. On each task, we find distinct clusters of models which are linearly connected on the test loss surface, but are disconnected from models outside the cluster---models that occupy separate basins on the surface. By measuring performance on specially-crafted diagnostic datasets, we find that these clusters correspond to different generalization strategies. For example, on MNLI, one cluster behaves like a bag of words model under domain shift, while another cluster uses syntactic heuristics. Our work demonstrates how the geometry of the loss surface can guide models towards different heuristic functions in standard finetuning settings.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have a substantial capacity for high-level analogical reasoning: reproducing patterns in linear text that occur in their training data (zero-shot evaluation) or in the provided context (few-shot in-context learning). However, recent studies show that even the largest LLMs fail in scenarios that require reasoning over multiple objects or facts or making sequences of logical deductions. We propose a two-stage probabilistic inference paradigm, ThinkSum, that reasons over sets of objects or facts in a structured manner. In the first stage (Think -- 'fast' retrieval of associations), a LLM is queried in parallel over a set of phrases extracted from the prompt or an auxiliary model call. In the second stage (Sum -- 'slow' probabilistic inference or reasoning), the results of these queries are aggregated to make the final prediction. We demonstrate the advantages of ThinkSum on the BIG-bench suite of evaluation tasks, achieving improvements over the state of the art using GPT-family models on ten difficult tasks, often with far smaller model variants. We compare and contrast ThinkSum with other proposed modifications to direct prompting of LLMs, such as variants of chain-of-thought prompting. We argue that because the probabilistic inference in ThinkSum is performed outside of calls to the LLM, ThinkSum is less sensitive to prompt design, yields more interpretable predictions, and can be flexibly combined with latent variable models to extract structured knowledge from LLMs.",

        "Here are some potential reviews based on the input and external data:\n\n**5-star review**\n\"ThinkSum is a game-changer for large language models (LLMs). By introducing a two-stage probabilistic inference paradigm, the authors have successfully addressed the limitations of LLMs in reasoning over multiple objects or facts. The ThinkSum approach is not only more effective than traditional prompting methods but also provides more interpretable predictions. The results on the BIG-bench suite of evaluation tasks are impressive, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. I particularly appreciate the flexibility of ThinkSum, which can be combined with latent variable models to extract structured knowledge from LLMs. This paper is a must-read for anyone working on LLMs and probabilistic reasoning.\"\n\n**4-star review**\n\"I was impressed by the ThinkSum approach, which tackles the challenging problem of reasoning over sets of objects or facts using large language models. The two-stage paradigm, consisting of 'fast' retrieval of associations and 'slow' probabilistic inference, is well-designed and effective. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of ThinkSum on the BIG-bench suite, demonstrating its advantages over other prompting methods. While I would have liked to see more analysis on the limitations of ThinkSum, the paper is well-written and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs. Overall, ThinkSum is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.\"\n\n**3-star review**\n\"ThinkSum is an interesting approach to probabilistic reasoning over sets using large language models. The authors propose a two-stage paradigm that combines the strengths of LLMs with probabilistic inference. While the results on the BIG-bench suite are promising, I'm not convinced that ThinkSum is a silver bullet for all reasoning tasks. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of ThinkSum and how it compares to other approaches, such as chain-of-thought prompting. Additionally, I would have liked to see more analysis on the interpretability of ThinkSum's predictions. Overall, ThinkSum is a solid contribution to the field, but it's not a revolutionary breakthrough.\"\n\n**2-star review**\n\"I was underwhelmed by the ThinkSum approach, which seems to be an incremental improvement over existing prompting methods. While the two-stage paradigm is well-designed, I'm not convinced that it's significantly better than other approaches, such as chain-of-thought prompting.

      "title": "TransFool: An Adversarial Attack against Neural Machine Translation Models",
      "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to small perturbations of their inputs known as adversarial attacks. In this paper, we consider the particular task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), where security is often critical. We investigate the vulnerability of NMT models to adversarial attacks and propose a new attack algorithm called TransFool. It builds on a multi-term optimization problem and a gradient projection step to compute adversarial examples that fool NMT models. By integrating the embedding representation of a language model in the proposed attack, we generate fluent adversarial examples in the source language that maintain a high level of semantic similarity with the clean samples and render the attack largely undetectable. Experimental results demonstrate that, for multiple translation tasks and different NMT architectures, our white-box attack can severely degrade the translation quality for more than 60% of the sentences while the semantic similarity between the original sentence and the adversarial example stays very high. Moreover, we show that the proposed attack is transferable to unknown target models and can fool those quite easily. Finally, our method leads to improvement in terms of success rate, semantic similarity, and fluency compared to the existing attack strategies both in white-box and black-box settings. Hence, TransFool permits to better characterize the vulnerability of NMT systems and outlines the necessity to design strong defense mechanisms and more robust NMT systems for real-life applications.",
