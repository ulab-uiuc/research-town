      "abstract": "Most graph neural networks follow the message passing mechanism. However, it faces the over-smoothing problem when multiple times of message passing is applied to a graph, causing indistinguishable node representations and prevents the model to effectively learn dependencies between farther-away nodes. On the other hand, features of neighboring nodes with different labels are likely to be falsely mixed, resulting in the heterophily problem. In this work, we propose to order the messages passing into the node representation, with specific blocks of neurons targeted for message passing within specific hops. This is achieved by aligning the hierarchy of the rooted-tree of a central node with the ordered neurons in its node representation. Experimental results on an extensive set of datasets show that our model can simultaneously achieve the state-of-the-art in both homophily and heterophily settings, without any targeted design. Moreover, its performance maintains pretty well while the model becomes really deep, effectively preventing the over-smoothing problem. Finally, visualizing the gating vectors shows that our model learns to behave differently between homophily and heterophily settings, providing an explainable graph neural model.",

        "### Review of \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\"\n\nIn their insightful paper, the authors address two critical challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs) - over-smoothing and heterophily. The conventional message passing mechanisms in GNNs tend to blur the distinctions between nodes, leading to over-smoothing. On the other hand, misrepresentation of nodes that have diverse labels in proximity results in a heterophily problem. \n\nThe proposed method, \"Ordered GNN,\" tackles these issues by ordering the messages during the passing phase and assigning specific blocks of neurons for different hops in the node hierarchy. This novel approach effectively aligns a rooted-tree hierarchy with the ordered neurons to enhance node representations.\n\n### Synergizing with \"Graph Neural Networks for Heterophily\"\n\nThe Ordered GNN shares conceptual synergies with the methodologies discussed in \"Graph Neural Networks for Heterophily.\" While Ordered GNN advances through incorporation of a rooted-tree aligned neuron ordering, it dovetails with the various mechanisms proposed for heterophily in the broader literature. Complementing this innovative idea, the existing body of knowledge around heterophily GNNs emphasizes the necessity to preserve distinct node label information despite close proximities and diverse graph topologies.\n\n### Empirical Validation and Performance Analysis\n\nExperimental results underscore Ordered GNN's efficacy across various datasets, demonstrating its superiority in both homophily and heterophily contexts. Additionally, the performance of Ordered GNN remains stable as the model depth increases, thereby mitigating the over-smoothing problem usually observed in conventional message passing frameworks. This reliable performance over deeper structures makes it a promising candidate for more complex network-based applications.\n\n### Visual Explainability\n\nAn intriguing aspect of Ordered GNN is the visual explainability through gating vectors, showing adaptative behaviors in different settings. This added transparency features allows for better understanding and trust in the model's decision-making process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn synthesis, \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\" is a commendable addition to the GNN field, presenting innovative solutions backed by rigorous empirical results and rich explanatory dimension. This marks a definitive step forward not only for theoretical advancements but also for practical applications requiring intricate and reliable graph analysis.",
        "## Review for \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\"\n\n### Summary\nThe paper \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\" presents a novel approach to enhance the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) by addressing two significant challenges: over-smoothing and heterophily. The core idea is to introduce ordered message passing, leveraging an architecture that aligns the rooted-tree hierarchy of a central node with its node representation. Experimental results demonstrate this novel model's effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, the model maintains performance even with increased depth, providing a robust solution against over-smoothing. The approach also offers explainability through visualized gating vectors, distinguishing it in both homophily and heterophily settings.\n\n### Strengths\n1. **Innovative Methodology**: The concept of ordered message passing is unique and addresses the critical aspects of GNN performance in heterophilous and homophilous contexts.\n2. **Scalability**: The model demonstrates robustness as it scales deeper, alleviating the over-smoothing issue commonly seen in GNNs.\n3. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Thorough experimentation on a wide array of datasets shows the model's competence in achieving leading results.\n4. **Explainability**: By visualizing the gating vectors, the paper not only offers a high-performing model but also contributes to the explainability of GNNs, which is often a challenging aspect.\n\n### Weaknesses\n1. **Complexity of Implementation**: The ordered message-passing mechanism, while beneficial, could add complexity to implementation, potentially hindering straightforward application and adoption.\n2. **Generalization Beyond Benchmarks**: While extensive benchmarks are presented, further discussion on the generalizability to diverse and unseen real-world graphs could strengthen the paper.\n3. **Comparative Analysis Depth**: More in-depth comparative analysis with specific models designed for heterophily and over-smoothing issues might provide deeper insights into the practical advantages of the proposed method.\n\n### Detailed Review\nThe Ordered GNN framework is a significant contribution in the landscape of graph neural networks, particularly given the dual focus on handling heterophily and avoiding over-smoothing. By ingeniously aligning hierarchical information of nodes within their neighborhoods, the model constructs effective node representations that cater differently to homophily and heterophily conditions. \n\nThe robustness displayed by the model as it goes deeper indicates a promising direction for future",
        "### Comprehensive Review of Graph Heterophily Handling in Neural Networks\n\n**Title: Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing**\n\nModern graph neural networks (GNNs) have predominantly relied on the conventional message passing mechanism to aggregate information from neighboring nodes. However, two significant challenges have consistently plagued these models: over-smoothing and heterophily. Over-smoothing refers to the phenomenon where nodes obtain overly similar representations after multiple message-passing steps, making it challenging to differentiate between them. Heterophily, on the other hand, occurs when nodes with dissimilar labels (neighboring nodes) share their features, leading to incorrect aggregations and impaired learning.\n\nThe paper \u201cOrdered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\u201d addresses these issues head-on by introducing a novel approach where message passing is systematically ordered within the nodes' representations. The innovative idea is to align the hierarchy of a rooted tree centered on a node with a specific arrangement of neurons assigned to particular hops. This structured alignment helps in isolating the propagated messages, thereby maintaining meaningful distinctions between node representations and mitigating both over-smoothing and heterophily.\n\nExperimental evidence from the study showcases the model's versatility and robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse settings encompassing both homophilic (nodes with similar labels are neighbors) and heterophilic graphs (nodes with different labels are neighbors). What's more impressive is that the model's efficacy remains largely unaffected even when it grows deeper, contrasting with many traditional GNNs that degrade due to over-smoothing.\n\nA visual examination of the gating vectors reveals intriguing insights: the model dynamically adjusts its behavior depending on the graph's nature (homophily vs. heterophily). This adaptability not only underscores its sophistication but also offers a layer of interpretability that is often missing in traditional GNN models.\n\nIn conclusion, the Ordered GNN presents a significant advancement in addressing the pervasive challenges of graph neural networks. By employing a structured message passing order, it effectively enhances the learning process across varying graph structures, promising improved performance and deeper insights into the workings of GNNs. This work not only amplifies our understanding of these neural networks but also paves the way for more refined and adaptable models in the future."

However, the challenge of efficiently training GNNs on large graphs\u2014sometimes spanning millions of nodes and billions of edges\u2014remains significant. Traditional sampling-based methods often resort to dropping edges and nodes to accelerate GNN training, which compromises graph integrity and model performance. Distributed GNN algorithms, which tap into multiple computing devices, are touted as solutions but come with their own sets of trade-offs.\n\nIn this context, the paper titled \"Distributed Graph Neural Network Training with Periodic Stale Representation Synchronization\" introduces DIGEST (DIstributed Graph reprEsentation SynchronizaTion), a novel framework designed to mitigate these inherent challenges. Unlike existing methods, DIGEST synergizes the strengths of both partition-based and propagation-based approaches. Partition-based methods, although efficient in communication cost, often suffer from information loss due to dropped edges. On the other hand, propagation-based methods, while preventing information loss, face prohibitive communication overhead due to neighbor explosion.\n\nDIGEST introduces a clever mechanism of utilizing stale representations of neighbors within different subgraphs during subgraph parallel training. This approach preserves global graph information, which mitigates information loss and reduces communication overhead. Additionally, the framework offers both synchronous and asynchronous training modes, catering to homogeneous and heterogeneous training environments, respectively. The notion of staleness-induced approximation error is addressed with an upper-bound proof, and most notably, the convergence rate is shown to be state-of-the-art.\n\nExtensive experimental evaluation on large real-world graph datasets highlights that DIGEST can achieve up to 21.82\u00d7 speedup while maintaining performance, positioning it favorably against current distributed GNN training frameworks. \n\n### Related Work and Broader Implications\n\nThe study dovetails with broader themes in the domain, as explored in other works like \"Training Graph Neural Networks with 1000 Layers.\" This paper deals with the depths of GNNs and highlights issues such as over-smoothing and computational complexity, which are particularly pertinent when considering large-scale graphs. Similarly, \"SuperGAT: Self-Supervised Graph Attention Networks\" explores self-supervised learning methods that also aim to harness massive datasets efficiently, aligning well with DIGEST's focus on scalable training mechanisms.\n\nOverall, DIGEST's novel approach to distributed GNN training",

The detailed convergence analysis and upper-bounded approximation error further establish DIGEST as a robust and efficient training method for GNNs. This framework represents a substantial step forward for scalable GNN training, offering a practical and effective solution for processing extensive real-world datasets. As the demand for handling larger and more complex graphs grows, DIGEST's contribution could set a new benchmark in distributed GNN training methodologies.\n\nTitle: Synergistic Techniques in Distributed GNN Training: From DIGEST to the Future\nReview: The landscape of Graph Neural Network (GNN) training has been significantly advanced by the introduction of distributed training frameworks like DIGEST, as presented in \"Distributed Graph Neural Network Training with Periodic Stale Representation Synchronization.\" This method tackles the intricate challenges associated with training on extensive graphs, typical in modern applications like social networks and knowledge graphs, by merging the strengths of both partition-based and propagation-based methods.\n\nDIGEST\u2019s ingenious approach to using stale representations of neighbors to curtail communication overhead while maintaining graph integrity marks a major progression in distributed GNN training. The ability to balance between synchronizing representations and mitigating the computational burden is a breakthrough, allowing for enhanced speedup\u2014up to 21.82 times\u2014without degrading model performance.\n\nThis paper not only proposes a theoretically sound framework with provable convergence rates but also validates its effectiveness through rigorous experimental evaluation on large, real-world datasets. The flexibility in supporting both synchronous and asynchronous training paradigms further augments its usability across various computational environments.

One of these\nchallenges is the rapidly growing number of tourists in space-limited regions such\nas historical city centers, museums, or geographical bottlenecks like narrow val-\nleys.

However, this technological breakthrough makes people wonder: how does a GNN make such decisions, and can we trust its prediction with high confidence? When it comes to some critical fields, such as biomedicine, where making wrong decisions can have severe consequences, it is crucial to interpret the inner working mechanisms of GNNs before applying them. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic model-level explanation method for different GNNs that follow the message passing scheme, GNNInterpreter, to explain the high-level decision-making process of the GNN model. More specifically, GNNInterpreter learns a probabilistic generative graph distribution that produces the most discriminative graph pattern the GNN tries to detect when making a certain prediction by optimizing a novel objective function specifically designed for the model-level explanation for GNNs. Compared to existing works, GNNInterpreter is more flexible and computationally efficient in generating explanation graphs with different types of node and edge features, without introducing another blackbox or requiring manually specified domain-specific rules. In addition, the experimental studies conducted on four different datasets demonstrate that the explanation graphs generated by GNNInterpreter match the desired graph pattern if the model is ideal; otherwise, potential model pitfalls can be revealed by the explanation.",

The intuition, often termed visual intuitive physics, is a critical ability that allows us to make effective plans to manipulate the scene to achieve desired outcomes without relying on extensive trial and error. In this paper, we present a framework capable of learning 3D-grounded visual intuitive physics models purely from unlabeled images. Our method is composed of a conditional Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-style visual frontend and a 3D point-based dynamics prediction backend, in which we impose strong relational and structural inductive bias to capture the structure of the underlying environment. Unlike existing intuitive point-based dynamics works that rely on the supervision of dense point trajectory from simulators, we relax the requirements and only assume access to multi-view RGB images and (imperfect) instance masks. This enables the proposed model to handle scenarios where accurate point estimation and tracking are hard or impossible. We evaluate the models on three challenging scenarios involving fluid, granular materials, and rigid objects, where standard detection and tracking methods are not applicable. We show our model can make long-horizon future predictions by learning from raw images and significantly outperforms models that do not employ an explicit 3D representation space. We also show that, once trained, our model can achieve strong generalization in complex scenarios under extrapolate settings.",

The inclusion of these real-world datasets is commendable as it demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed mechanism in diverse scientific fields.\n\nOverall, this work makes a substantial contribution to the field by addressing both interpretability and robustness, thereby paving the way for more transparent and reliable GDL applications in scientific research.\n\n### Review 2: Enhancing Scientific Analysis with Interpretable Geometric Deep Learning\n\nIn \"Interpretable Geometric Deep Learning via Learnable Randomness Injection,\" the authors propose a novel mechanism aimed at making geometric deep learning (GDL) models inherently interpretable. The need for interpretability in GDL is particularly pressing in scientific fields where point cloud data is often used and where understanding the model's decision-making process is crucial.\n\nThe Learnable Randomness Injection (LRI) mechanism is a fresh approach that integrates interpretability into the model itself, therefore bypassing the shortcomings of post-hoc interpretation methods. One of the most compelling aspects of LRI is its grounding in the information bottleneck principle, which not only facilitates interpretability but also enhances the model's robustness against distribution shifts. This is particularly important for scientific experiments where training and test data may not always come from the same distribution.\n\nThe authors validate their approach using four datasets from high-energy physics and biochemistry. The results indicate that LRI-induced models are superior in detecting points that significantly align with scientifically meaningful ground-truth patterns. This not only enhances the model's reliability but also its utility in scientific analysis and experimentation.\n\nIn conclusion"

Unlike traditional methods, FMP employs these attributes in forward propagation, making the use of sensitive data more explicit and interpretable. This transparency not only enhances trust in the model but also allows for better debug and audits.\n\nThe experimental validation is robust, utilizing three real-world datasets for node classification tasks. The results are compelling, showing that FMP not only competes with but often exceeds existing methods in terms of fairness and accuracy. The availability of the code further promotes reproducibility, a crucial aspect of contemporary research. In summary, this paper makes a significant stride towards transparent and fair GNNs, offering a practical tool for both researchers and practitioners.\n\n### Review 3: Enhancing Fairness in GNNs through Transparent Fair Message Passing\nThe paper \"Fair Graph Message",
        "Based on the abstract provided and additional context on recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), here are a few synthesized reviews blending multiple titles that would be insightful for those in the field:\n\n---\n\n### Review: A New Horizon in Fair Machine Learning: Transparent Fair Graph Message Passing\n\nThe field of machine learning, particularly with graph neural networks (GNNs), is witnessing a transformative shift with the introduction of transparent fairness methods. The recently published paper \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\" sets a new benchmark by addressing a critical gap in the current landscape of fairness models. The authors introduce the concept of **transparency** to go beyond traditional regularization and adversarial debiasing techniques, which largely operate as black-box solutions.\n\nThis new framework, named **Fair Message Passing (FMP)**, strategically incorporates sensitive attributes during forward propagation to elucidate their influence on predictions. By doing so, FMP not only ensures fairness but also empowers stakeholders to understand and trust the fairness embedded within the model. This form of transparency holds substantial promise for publically perceivable and trustworthy AI systems.\n\nFurthermore, the unification of graph smoothness and fairness objectives within the FMP scheme presents a seamless approach to mitigating bias, which is often overlooked in traditional methods. The acceleration techniques adopted for efficiency mark another significant engineering milestone, ensuring that FMP is not only fair but also scalable and robust.\n\nExperimental results affirm the potential of FMP, showcasing superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple real-world datasets. The availability of the code via an open-source platform is a commendable effort to foster collaborative advancements in this critical domain.\n\n---\n\n### Review: Demystifying Fairness in GNNs: The Fair Message Passing (FMP) Revolution\n\nIn the evolving frontier of graph neural networks (GNNs), achieving fairness has remained a pivotal yet elusive goal. The paper titled \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\" takes a pioneering step towards demystifying fairness by introducing the **Fair Message Passing (FMP)** scheme. Unlike conventional fairness methods, FMP differentiates itself by embedding sensitive attribute usage during forward propagation rather than backward propagation. This shift is not merely technical but philosophical\u2014it aligns machine learning fairness with public transparency.\n\nThe FMP framework explicitly reveals how sensitive attributes influence the predictions, transforming fairness from an abstract concept into a tangible, observable attribute of the model. This ability to lend fairness perception to the public could potentially reshape the discourse around ethical AI and its deployment in sensitive domains.\n\nMoreover, the unified approach towards achieving both graph smoothness and fairness",
        "Certainly! Below are some interconnected reviews for the paper \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency,\" incorporating key details from the abstract to provide insights into its relevance and potential impact.\n\n---\n\n### Review 1: Pioneering Transparency in Fairness for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\n\nThe paper \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\" sets a new standard in the realm of fairness-awareness for graph neural networks by introducing the concept of transparency. Traditional fairness-aware GNN methods often obfuscate how sensitive attributes influence the model's final predictions, making it challenging to explain and validate the fairness of the outcomes to a wider audience. \n\nBy implementing the Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme, this paper not only addresses this issue but also demonstrates how explicitly rendering sensitive attribute usage during forward propagation can uncover the mechanisms behind fair predictions. This is particularly impactful because it allows stakeholders and practitioners to visually and logically trace how fairness considerations are applied within the model, aligning with principles of ethical AI and responsible machine learning.\n\nFurthermore, the FMP scheme seamlessly integrates fairness and accuracy objectives within a unified framework, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that may struggle to balance these often competing goals. The provided experimental results substantiate the claim that FMP not only achieves but surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy and fairness on widely-used real-world datasets.\n\n### Review 2: A Unified Framework for Fairness and Efficiency in GNNs\n\nThe paper \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\" brings forth a novel approach to tackling fairness in machine learning by introducing a transparency component. The Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme stands out for its ability to make the use of sensitive attribute information in GNNs clear and explicit during forward propagation. This departure from the traditional backward propagation methods for encoding fairness marks a significant step forward. \n\nFMP also impresses with its dual capability to simultaneously achieve graph smoothness and fairness objectives. Through effective and transparent leveraging of sensitive attributes, the model not only mitigates biases but also enhances predictive performance. This dual-objective approach is particularly noteworthy because it ensures that fairness does not come at the cost of accuracy\u2014a balance that is crucial in practical applications.\n\nAnother highlight is the adoption of an acceleration method within the FMP framework, enhancing its computational efficiency without compromising effectiveness. This makes the FMP method both practical and scalable, providing a strong case for its application across diverse real-world scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, the introduction of FMP with transparency not only advances the state-of-the-art in fairness-aware GNN models but also sets a new benchmark for transparency,"
