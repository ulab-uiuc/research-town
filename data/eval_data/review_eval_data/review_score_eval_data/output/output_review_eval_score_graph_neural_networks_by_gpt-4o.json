        "### Review of \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\"\n\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a powerful tool for a variety of tasks involving graph-structured data, but they often grapple with the challenges of heterophily (where neighboring nodes are dissimilar) and over-smoothing (where multiple message-passing rounds lead to indistinguishable node representations). The paper \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\" presents an innovative approach to mitigate these issues through a structured ordering of message passing.\n\n#### Key Contributions:\n\n1. **Ordered Message Passing**: The authors propose a method to align the hierarchy of the rooted-tree of a central node with the ordered neurons in its node representation. This structured message passing aims to target specific blocks of neurons within specific hops, allowing for more nuanced aggregation of messages.\n\n2. **Effectiveness Against Over-smoothing**: By designing the ordered message passing mechanism, Ordered GNN maintains node representational uniqueness even as the model depth increases, effectively circumventing the over-smoothing problem which is prevalent in standard GNN architectures.\n\n3. **Homophily and Heterophily Handling**: The model's structure allows it to adapt to both homophilous (similar neighboring nodes) and heterophilous (dissimilar neighboring nodes) settings without any specialized changes. This demonstrates the versatility and robustness of the proposed approach.\n\n4. **Explainability**: Visualization of the gating vectors shows that the model differentiates its behavior based on the graph's homophily or heterophily, adding an explainable dimension to the GNN which is often regarded as a 'black-box' model.\n\n#### Experimental Validation:\n\nThe authors validate their method through extensive experiments on several datasets. Across both homophily and heterophily settings, Ordered GNN exhibits state-of-the-art performance metrics, confirming its robustness and efficacy. Notably, the model performs efficiently even as it becomes deeper, which is a significant improvement over traditional GNN systems prone to over-smoothing.\n\n#### Review Summary:\n\nOverall, \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\" offers a sophisticated yet practical solution to the enduring challenges of GNNs. By providing an ordered structure to message passing, it not only alleviates the issues of over-smoothing and heterophily but also maintains adaptability across a variety of graph settings. The comprehensive experimental results and the added explainability make it",
        "### Ordered GNN: An Effective Solution to Heterophily and Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks\n\nIn \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing,\" the authors propose an innovative approach to tackle two significant challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs): heterophily and over-smoothing. Traditional GNNs often fail to differentiate between nodes after multiple levels of message passing, leading to the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, nodes with different labels but close proximity may falsely merge features, causing the heterophily problem.\n\nThe Ordered GNN addresses these issues by strategically ordering message passing within nodes. By aligning a rooted tree structure of a central node with ordered neurons in its representation, each neuron block focuses on message passing within specific hops. This unique design prevents erroneous feature amalgamation in heterophily settings and effectively alleviates the over-smoothing impact in deep GNN architectures.\n\nExperimental results on various datasets demonstrate the Ordered GNN's robustness and versatility, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both homophily and heterophily scenarios. The model's ability to remain effective even as it scales in depth is particularly noteworthy, setting it apart from conventional GNNs that often deteriorate under similar conditions.\n\nMoreover, the study offers an explainable GNN model through the visualization of gating vectors, highlighting how the model adapts its behavior between homophily and heterophily settings. This transparency may enhance trust and application of GNNs in complex real-world tasks requiring nuanced node relationship analysis.\n\nIn essence, Ordered GNN presents a significant leap in handling fundamental challenges in GNNs, paving the way for more robust and interpretable graph-based learning systems.\n\n---\n\n### Addressing Core GNN Challenges: Insights from Ordered GNN\n\nThe paper \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\" introduces a novel methodology to enhance the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) by overcoming two key issues: over-smoothing and heterophily. \n\nTraditionally, GNNs employ message passing across connected nodes, which when extended over multiple layers, often leads to over-smoothing\u2014whereby node representations become indistinct. Additionally, in heterophilic settings where nodes of differing labels are neighboring, conventional message passing mechanisms can erroneously combine distinct features, degrading classification performance.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, the authors propose an Ordered GNN that sequences the message passing through node representations. This approach involves aligning neuron blocks within a node to specific hops",

Based on the external data provided for the paper titled \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing,\" here is a review that could potentially merge well with another related paper that might be about improving graph neural network architectures or dealing with graph-based learning problems.\n\n---\n\n**Review for \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\"**\n\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of machine learning, providing powerful tools for dealing with graph-structured data. However, standard GNN architectures often struggle with two major issues: over-smoothing, where node representations become indistinguishably similar after multiple message-passing layers, and heterophily, where nodes connected by edges may have different labels and features, leading to inaccurate representations. \n\nThe paper \"Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing\" tackles these challenges with a novel approach. The authors propose an innovative method that orders messages passing into node representations, assigning specific blocks of neurons for messages from nodes at different hops. This ordering aligns the hierarchical structure of the central node's rooted-tree with the ordered neurons of its representation. \n\nExperimental results are highly promising, demonstrating that Ordered GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both homophily and heterophily settings across an extensive set of datasets. Notably, the model's performance remains robust even as it becomes substantially deep, effectively mitigating the over-smoothing problem. Additionally, the model provides an explainable element by visualizing gating vectors that indicate its adaptive behavior in different graph structures.\n\n**Review for \"Overcoming the Challenges of Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Message Passing\"**\n\nExpanding upon the body of work addressing the limitations of GNNs, the paper \u201cOvercoming the Challenges of Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Message Passing\u201d synergizes well with the insights presented in \"Ordered GNN.\" This paper highlights the importance of structuring message passing to cope with problems intrinsic to graph data, such as node representation blending and heterophily.\n\nBy organizing the message-passing process hierarchically, this approach complements the Ordered GNNs method by ensuring that node features are aggregated in a layered manner. It addresses over-smoothing by retaining distinct layers for different depths, and through hierarchical selection, it minimizes the negative impacts of heterophily by carefully handling node similarities.\n\nThe solution is elegant in its simplicity yet profound in its capability to foster robust and adaptable GNNs.

      "abstract": "Despite the recent success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it remains challenging to train a GNN on large graphs with over millions of nodes & billions of edges, which are prevalent in many graph-based applications such as social networks, recommender systems, and knowledge graphs. Traditional sampling-based methods accelerate GNN training by dropping edges and nodes, which impairs the graph integrity and model performance. Differently, distributed GNN algorithms accelerate GNN training by utilizing multiple computing devices and can be classified into two types: \"partition-based\" methods enjoy low communication cost but suffer from information loss due to dropped edges, while \"propagation-based\" methods avoid information loss but suffer from prohibitive communication overhead caused by neighbor explosion. To jointly address these problems, this paper proposes DIGEST (DIstributed Graph reprEsentation SynchronizaTion), a novel distributed GNN training framework that synergizes the complementary strength of both categories of existing methods. We propose to allow each device utilize the stale representations of its neighbors in other subgraphs during subgraph parallel training. This way, out method preserves global graph information from neighbors to avoid information loss and reduce the communication cost. Therefore, DIGEST is both computation-efficient and communication-efficient as it does not need to frequently (re-)compute and transfer the massive representation data across the devices, due to neighbor explosion. DIGEST provides synchronous and asynchronous training manners for homogeneous and heterogeneous training environment, respectively. We proved that the approximation error induced by the staleness of the representations can be upper-bounded. More importantly, our convergence analysis demonstrates that DIGEST enjoys the state-of-the-art convergence rate. Extensive experimental evaluation on large, real-world graph datasets shows that DIGEST achieves up to 21.82\u00d7 speedup without compromising the performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed GNN training frameworks",

This work presents the DIGEST framework, which aims to tackle the issues found in traditional sampling-based and existing distributed GNN methods. \n\nThe core idea behind DIGEST is the use of stale representations to avoid the high communication costs typically associated with propagation-based methods and the information loss found in partition-based approaches. By leveraging stale neighbor representations within subgraph parallel training, DIGEST provides a balanced solution ensuring global graph information is preserved and reducing the frequency of massive data transfers between devices. \n\nThe theoretical contributions of the paper are noteworthy. The authors offer a detailed convergence analysis proving that the error due to stale representations can be effectively bounded. This analysis is crucial for the credibility of the proposed method since it assures that the accuracy of the GNN models will not be significantly compromised. Additionally, the sufficiency of the framework is validated through extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets from real-world applications, showing an impressive speedup of up to 21.82\u00d7 compared to existing state-of-the-art frameworks.\n\nHowever, the paper does leave some questions open. For example, the specific conditions under which the stale representations start to significantly affect model performance are not thoroughly examined. Additionally, while DIGEST\u2019s hybrid synchronous and asynchronous training is innovative, the performance and trade-offs in heterogeneous environments demand further scrutiny. Despite these minor gaps, the work represents a substantial contribution to the field of distributed GNN training.\n\n### Synergistic Review of \"Distributed Graph Neural Network Training with Periodic Stale Representation Synchronization\" and \"Accelerating Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks with Stale Representation Synchronization\"\n\nWhen examining \"Distributed Graph Neural Network Training with Periodic Stale Representation Synchronization\" alongside related work on accelerating large-scale GNNs using stale representation synchronization, it's evident that the field is moving towards solutions that balance efficiency and performance without compromising on either front.\n\nBoth papers identify a fundamental challenge in GNN training\u2014the trade-off between computational efficiency and maintaining the integrity of graph information. Traditional methods either drop important graph elements or suffer from severe communication overheads. DIGEST's strategy of leveraging stale data appears to be a promising strategy to mitigate these issues. \n\nThe use of stale representations, a shared concept in the discussed papers, presents a practical compromise, enabling devices to",
        "The research presented under the titles \u201cDistributed Graph Neural Network Training with Periodic Stale Representation Synchronization\u201d and \u201cDIGEST: A Novel Framework for Efficient Distributed GNN Training\u201d offers groundbreaking advancements in the realm of distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN) training. Both papers emphasize the challenges inherent to training GNNs on massive graphs comprising millions of nodes and billions of edges, which are commonplace in applications like social networks and recommender systems.\n\nThe traditional methods for accelerating GNN training, essentially through sampling-based techniques, often lead to a loss of information due to dropped edges and nodes. This information loss directly impairs the integrity of the graph and hampers model performance. In contrast, distributed GNN algorithms utilize multiple computing devices to this end. These methods are categorized into \"partition-based\" and \"propagation-based\" approaches; the former is low on communication cost but loses information due to dropped edges, while the latter avoids information loss but suffers from substantial communication overhead due to neighbor explosion.\n\nIn the context of these challenges, the introduction of DIGEST (DIstributed Graph reprEsentation SynchronizaTion) marks a significant innovation. The DIGEST framework uniquely combines the strengths of both existing methods. One of its key contributions is allowing each device to utilize stale representations of its neighbors in other subgraphs during parallel training. This approach effectively retains global graph information and minimizes communication costs by mitigating the frequent necessity to recompute and transfer colossal representation data among devices. \n\nWhat sets DIGEST apart is its flexibility to support both synchronous and asynchronous training, making it adaptable to homogeneous and heterogeneous training environments, respectively. The papers assert that they have derived an upper bound for the approximation error induced by using stale representations, ensuring the reliability of this method. Furthermore, their convergence analysis showcases that DIGEST achieves state-of-the-art convergence rates.\n\nExperimental evaluations substantiate these theoretical claims, with DIGEST delivering up to 21.82\u00d7 speedup in performance on large, real-world graph datasets without sacrificing model accuracy. This marks a considerable leap compared to existing distributed GNN training frameworks, thereby solidifying DIGEST's position as a pivotal contribution to scalable and efficient GNN training methodologies.\n\nIn summary, these papers collectively present DIGEST as a powerful, efficient, and versatile framework for distributed GNN training, capable of handling the intricacies and scale of real-world graph data while significantly enhancing training speed and preserving model fidelity. This innovation holds immense potential for a wide array of graph-based applications in the industry.",

The central contribution is the learnable graph convolutional attention network (L-CAT), which dynamically interpolates between GCN, GAT, and a newly proposed graph convolutional attention layer (CAT). \n\n#### Strengths:\n1. **Innovative Layer Design**: The introduction of the graph convolutional attention layer (CAT) is a commendable innovation. By leveraging convolutions to compute attention scores, CAT bridges the gap between uniform and non-uniform message passing.\n2. **Automatic Interpolation**: The L-CAT architecture automatically adjusts the degree to which it employs GCN, GAT, and CAT at each layer using only two scalar parameters. This leads to a highly adaptive model that flexibly tailors itself to the specifics of the data.\n3. **Robust Performance**: The method is empirically validated over numerous datasets, demonstrating superior results over existing GNN architectures. This robustness reflects L-CAT's ability to navigate diverse graph structures and feature distributions.\n4. **Reduced Cross-Validation Needs**: By effectively combining different layer types internally, L-CAT reduces the necessity for extensive cross-validation, which is particularly advantageous in scenarios with limited computational resources.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Complexity in Understanding Interpolation Mechanism**: While the paper outlines the benefits of interpolation between GCN, GAT, and CAT, a more detailed discussion on the underlying mechanics and theoretical justification for this approach would add clarity.\n2. **Scalability Concerns**: Although robust on standard datasets, the performance and scalability on extremely large and sparse graphs remain to be fully explored.\n\nIn summary, \"Learnable Graph Convolutional Attention Networks\" presents a significant step forward in the realm of graph neural networks, offering a potent combination of existing techniques and a novel adaptive mechanism that proves advantageous in diverse applications.\n\n---\n\n### Review of \"Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications\"\n\nAs a complementary piece, \"Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications\" provides an exhaustive survey of various GNN methodologies, their theoretical underpinnings, and",

This hybrid model could be a game-changer for applications spanning from social network analysis to molecular biology.\n\n#### Strengths of GCNs and GATs\nGCNs and GATs each have their respective advantages. GCNs aggregate features uniformly across neighboring nodes, which makes them robust in handling homophilic graphs where connected nodes tend to share similar features. On the other hand, GATs assign variable attention scores to different neighboring nodes, making them more flexible and powerful in heterophilic graphs where relationships between nodes are more nuanced.\n\n#### Introduction of the CAT Layer\nIn this context, the authors propose the Convolutional Attention Layer (CAT), which leverages convolutions to compute attention scores. This novel approach aims to blend the uniform feature aggregation of GCNs with the selective feature emphasis of GATs. However, their experiments suggest that neither GCNs, GATs, nor CAT layers are consistently superior across different datasets.\n\n#### Learnable Graph Convolutional Attention Network (L-CAT)\nThe cornerstone of this work is the development of the L-CAT architecture. L-CAT introduces learnable parameters that allow each layer of the network to dynamically interpolate between GCN, GAT, and CAT behaviors. This flexibility means L-CAT can adapt its learning strategy to the specific characteristics of the input graph and node features.\n\n#### Empirical Performance\nThe empirical results are impressive: L-CAT outperforms standalone GCNs, GATs, and even CAT layers across various benchmark datasets.

The authors present a novel algorithm that adapts edge connections to maintain information propagation while avoiding over-compression of information (oversquashing) and excessive homogenization of node features (oversmoothing). Their rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates that this method is effective and computationally efficient.\n\nOne of the highlights of the FoSR method is its use of spectral expansion to guide edge additions. Unlike some existing methods where added edges are chosen arbitrarily or through computationally expensive global searches, spectral expansion offers a theoretically grounded and practical solution. This also aligns with recent studies emphasizing the role of graph curvature and spectral properties in the performance and behavior of GNNs.\n\nFurther, the integration of a relational architecture is noteworthy.

The paper titled \"Interpretable Geometric Deep Learning via Learnable Randomness Injection\" addresses this challenge by introducing a novel mechanism called learnable randomness injection (LRI).\n\nThe LRI mechanism stands out by providing inherent interpretability to GDL models. This is a significant improvement over traditional post-hoc interpretation methods. Once trained, LRI-induced models can pinpoint the specific points in the point cloud that are indicative of the prediction labels, thus offering scientists direct insights into the data's critical aspects. This is achieved by grounding the approach in the information bottleneck principle, making the models not only interpretable but also more robust to distributional shifts between the training and test datasets.\n\nTo validate the efficacy of LRI, the authors propose four datasets from real scientific applications. The resulting LRI-induced models demonstrate a markedly stable and closer alignment with the ground-truth patterns, which are of actual scientific relevance, compared to previous interpretation methods.\n\nThe availability of the code and datasets on GitHub provides an excellent resource for further exploration and application of this method. Overall, this work presents a considerable advancement in the application of GDL in scientific research, making it a valuable read for those interested in interpretable AI and its applications across various scientific domains.\n\n### Review 2: Bridging Interpretable AI and Scientific Analysis via Geometric Deep Learning\n\nThe paper \"Interpretable Geometric Deep Learning via Learnable Randomness Injection\" contributes a significant advancement in the domain of geometric deep learning (GDL) by tackling the long-standing issue of model interpretability. The proposed learnable randomness injection (LRI) mechanism brings forth a way to generate inherently interpretable GDL models, which is a notable departure from the traditionally opaque nature of these models.\n\nLRI's interpretability is particularly beneficial in scientific practices where understanding the underlying patterns in data is crucial. By leveraging the information bottleneck principle, LRI can identify the points in the point cloud data that are critical for prediction tasks. This makes the model's decisions more transparent and comprehensible to scientists, thus easing the deployment of these models in practical scientific analyses and experiments.\n\nThe authors evaluated the LRI mechanism on four datasets derived from",

The authors introduce an innovative mechanism named learnable randomness injection (LRI), which serves to imbue GDL models with an intrinsic ability to elucidate their functioning.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of this work is its commitment to interpretability, a pressing concern given the complexity and often opaque nature of deep learning models, particularly in scientific contexts where model transparency is tantamount to trust and replicability. The proposed LRI mechanism diverges from traditional post-hoc interpretation methods by incorporating interpretability directly into the model training phase. This not only aids in the identification of crucial data points but also ensures that these points are more consistently aligned with real-world scientific patterns.\n\nThe utility of LRI is rigorously validated across four diverse datasets drawn from high-energy physics and biochemistry, providing compelling evidence of its robustness and applicability.

        "**Review 1: Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency**\n\nReviewer 1:\nThe paper titled *Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency* introduces a novel approach to enhancing fairness in graph neural networks (GNNs). The authors address a significant gap in existing fairness methods which operate like a \"black box\" by making the process transparent. The focus on transparency is particularly commendable as it allows researchers and practitioners alike to understand how sensitive attributes are used to achieve fair predictions.\n\nThe Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme proposed is effective and forward-thinking in explicitly using sensitive attributes during forward propagation. This is a novel approach and addresses a key issue with previous methods that often relied on backward propagation, which lacks transparency. Additionally, the paper demonstrates how the FMP can effectively aggregate information from neighbors, which is crucial in graph-based learning, to achieve simultaneous graph smoothness and fairness objectives.\n\nOne of the notable strengths of this work is the solid experimental validation. The authors demonstrate that FMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both in terms of fairness and accuracy across multiple real-world datasets. This empirical evidence provides a strong foundation for the proposed methodology. Moreover, the inclusion of an acceleration approach to improve the efficiency of FMP is a practical enhancement that broadens its applicability.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of fairness in machine learning, particularly within the domain of graph neural networks. The transparency brought forth by the FMP scheme moves the field in a positive direction by not only achieving fair predictions but also conveying a clear understanding of how these fair predictions are made.\n\n**Review 2: Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency in Practice**\n\nReviewer 2:\nThe concept of fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, and the paper titled *Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency* provides an innovative solution by introducing transparency in fairness methods for GNNs. The authors' proposition and subsequent development of the Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme is both timely and highly relevant. \n\nThe FMP scheme's emphasis on deliberate and explicit utilization of sensitive attribute information during forward propagation is a key innovation. It contrasts with traditional models that often obscure how such attributes are processed, thereby failing to provide transparency. This transparency is crucial not only for improving model trustworthiness but also for ensuring that stakeholders understand the dynamics behind fair predictions.\n\nThe methodology section is robust, detailing how the FMP scheme integrates sensitive attributes, aggregates neighbor information, and addresses bias within a unified framework aiming for both graph smoothness and fairness.

The authors argue that traditional methods often keep the inner workings of fairness mechanisms concealed, leading to a \"black box\" scenario. This paper notably shifts the paradigm by proposing the Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme, which leverages sensitive attribute information during the forward propagation phase.\n\nThe transparency aspect of FMP is particularly compelling. By explicitly showcasing how sensitive attributes affect predictions, the model not only achieves fairness but also enhances trustworthiness and interpretability. This dual objective of transparency and fairness is timely and crucial, especially in sensitive applications where fairness and accountability are paramount.\n\nMoreover, combining fairness and graph smoothness objectives within a unified framework is a smart move. The acceleration approach incorporated in FMP to boost efficiency further makes it a robust tool in practice. Empirical results on node classification tasks validate the effectiveness of FMP, outperforming existing baselines in both fairness and accuracy on multiple datasets.\n\nOverall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of fair machine learning, especially in the context of GNNs. The authors' focus on transparency sets a new standard and opens up new avenues for research in interpretable fairness.\n\n---\n\n### Combined Title: Fair and Transparent Graph Algorithms for Ethical AI\n\n#### Review:\nThe growing ethical concerns in AI necessitate advanced methods to ensure fairness and interpretability in machine learning models, particularly in graph neural networks (GNNs). In light of this, \"Fair and Transparent Graph Algorithms for Ethical AI,\" consolidates the themes discussed in the research about Fair Graph Message Passing (FMP) with the broader aspirations of ethical AI.\n\nThe highlight of this combined work is the innovative Fair Message Passing scheme, which brings transparency to fairness mechanisms in GNNs. Traditional approaches often obscure the role of sensitive attributes in decision-making processes, leading to a lack of public confidence in the models' ethics. FMP challenges this norm by explicitly showcasing how sensitive attributes influence predictions during forward propagation. This explicitness not only fulfills fairness objectives but also enhances model interpretability and public trust.\n\nThe methodology of balancing graph smoothness with fairness in a unified framework is pathbreaking.

The authors propose an innovative method to compress the training graph, aiming to reduce storage requirements without compromising inference accuracy. The essence of the work lies in creating a compressed graph that can replace the original training set, ensuring that the GNN model's structure remains unchanged during inference.\n\n### Methodology and Key Contributions\n\n**1. Problem Identification:**\nThe authors identify a significant bottleneck in the deployment phase of GNNs\u2014the storage of the entire training graph and its associated node features during the inference stage. This issue is particularly pronounced in large-scale applications where the storage and computational resources are limited.\n\n**2. Graph Compression Technique:**\nThe proposed solution involves constructing a compressed version of the training graph. This compressed graph retains the essential characteristics of the original graph but with a significantly reduced number of nodes. The compression process is designed thoughtfully to ensure minimal approximation error during the forward pass of the GNN.\n\n**3. Theoretical and Empirical Validation:**\nThe authors provide a rigorous analysis of the error introduced by the compression process. They derive methods to construct the compressed graph that minimizes this error, ensuring that the GNN's performance is not adversely affected. Empirical validation on semi-supervised node classification tasks demonstrates that this approach can achieve substantial reductions in storage requirements while maintaining or even improving inference accuracy.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n**Storage Efficiency:**\nOne of the most compelling practical benefits of this approach is the dramatic reduction in storage requirements for GNN serving. This is especially crucial for real-world applications involving large-scale graphs, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and biological networks.\n\n**Simplicity and Effectiveness:**\nAn equally notable advantage is the method's simplicity. As the compressed graph directly replaces the original graph without altering the GNN model or its forward pass, this technique is straightforward to implement and integrate into existing GNN deployment pipelines.\n\n### Related Works and Comparisons\n\nWhen contextualized within the broader landscape of GNN optimization research, this work stands out by focusing on the inference stage, a relatively underexplored area compared to training-time optimizations.

While several efforts have been made to scale GNNs training for large-scale graphs, GNNs still suffer from the scalability challenge of model inference, due to the graph dependency issue incurred by the message passing mechanism, therefore hindering its deployment in resource-constrained applications. A recent study~\\citep{zhang2021graph} revealed that GNNs can be compressed to inference-friendly multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), by training MLPs using the soft labels of labeled and unlabeled nodes from the teacher. However, blindly leveraging the soft labels of all unlabeled nodes may be suboptimal, since the teacher model would inevitably make wrong predictions. This intriguing observation motivates us to ask: \\textit{Is it possible to train a stronger MLP student by making better use of the unlabeled data?} \n\nThis paper studies cross-model knowledge distillation - from GNN teacher to MLP student in a semi-supervised setting, showing their strong promise in achieving a ``sweet point'' in co-optimizing model accuracy and efficiency. Our proposed solution, dubbed \\textit{Reliable Knowledge Distillation for MLP optimization} (\\textbf{RKD-MLP}), is the first noise-aware knowledge distillation framework for GNNs distillation. Its core idea is to use a meta-policy to filter out those unreliable soft labels. To train the meta-policy, we design a reward-driven objective based on a meta-set and adopt policy gradient to optimize the expected reward. Then we apply the meta-policy to the unlabeled nodes and select the most reliable soft labels for distillation. Extensive experiments across various GNN backbones, on 7 small graphs and 2 large-scale datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark, demonstrate the superiority of our proposal. Moreover, our RKD-MLP model shows good robustness w.r.t. graph topology and node feature noises. The code is available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RKD-MLP-F2A6/}.",

However, the real-world applicability of GNNs is often marred by their inherent scalability and inference challenges, especially under resource-constrained environments. This paper attempts to address these enduring issues through a novel approach titled \"Reliable Knowledge Distillation for MLP optimization\" (RKD-MLP). \n\nThe core innovation here is the integration of a noise-aware knowledge distillation framework that selectively utilizes reliable soft labels derived from GNNs for training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). By leveraging a meta-policy to filter out unreliable soft labels, the authors effectively tackle the inaccuracies that typically plague blind knowledge distillation methods. This meta-policy is further refined through a reward-driven objective function, ensuring the selection of high-quality labels.\n\nDrawing insights from extensive experiments carried out on a diverse set of GNN backbones and datasets\u2014including both small graphs and large-scale benchmarks from the Open Graph Benchmark\u2014the proposed RKD-MLP demonstrates significant strides in balancing model accuracy and computational efficiency. Particularly noteworthy is its robustness against variations in graph topology and node features, which underscores the framework's adaptability in dynamic application scenarios.\n\nIn essence, this paper not only advances the current state of cross-model knowledge distillation but also opens new avenues for deploying high-performance MLPs in areas constrained by limited computational resources. \n\n**Title: Efficient Graph Neural Networks with Reliable Knowledge Distillation: A Meta-policy Approach**\n\nReview:\n\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning from network-structured data.

Historically, the assessment of the expressive power of GNNs has been closely associated with the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test. However, this perspective is somewhat limited as it does not account for geometric isomorphisms which are prevalent in real-world graphs that are embedded in Euclidean space. The authors address this gap by introducing the Geometric Weisfeiler-Leman (GWL) test, a modified version that respects physical symmetries such as permutation, rotation, reflection, and translation. This addition allows for a nuanced approach to studying the topological and geometric properties of graphs.\n\nOne of the key contributions of this paper is the characterisation of the expressive power of GNNs that adhere to these physical symmetries (equivariant GNNs) as opposed to those that are invariant. Equivariant GNN layers are found to have significant advantages in distinguishing geometric graphs compared to their invariant counterparts. This insight is vital for researchers working in geometric deep learning as it provides formalised guidance on the architectural choices that can lead to more powerful models.\n\nFurthermore, the paper draws a fascinating connection between the discrimination-based evaluation of GNNs and their universal approximation properties. This integrated perspective enriches the theory behind GNNs and paves the way for future work in the domain. Overall, this paper is a substantial contribution that augments our understanding of GNNs in the context of geometric data.\n\n### Review 2: The Role of the Geometric Weisfeiler-Leman Test in GNNs\n\nThe paper entitled \"On the Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks\" provides a thorough investigation into how GNNs can be tailored to better handle graphs embedded in Euclidean spaces, which are common in numerous practical applications. The authors propose a variant of the WL test known as the Geometric Weisfeiler-Leman (GWL) test. This variant is distinguished by its ability to respect essential physical symmetries, thus offering a more comprehensive tool for the analysis of real-world geometric graphs.\n\nOne significant insight offered by the authors is the distinction between GNNs that are invariant to these symmetries and those that are equivariant. By examining these",

By proposing the Geometric WL (GWL) test, the authors provide a framework that respects the physical symmetries inherent in real-world applications, such as permutation, rotation, reflection, and translation.\n\nOne key strength of the paper is its thorough theoretical grounding. By characterizing the expressive power of GNNs under these physical symmetries, the authors provide valuable insights into the advantages of equivariant GNN layers over their invariant counterparts. This offers a more nuanced understanding of how geometric information can be harnessed in Graph Neural Networks, exploring when and why certain architectures are superior for specific tasks.\n\nMoreover, the paper adeptly connects the GWL test's discrimination perspective with the universal approximation properties of geometric GNNs. This integrated view not only enriches the theoretical landscape but also has practical implications for designing more effective GNN models.\n\n**Potential Improvements:**\n\nWhile the paper excels in its theoretical contributions, additional empirical validation, particularly on benchmark geometric datasets, would strengthen the argument for the practical utility of the GWL test. Future work could also explore the computational efficiency of these more expressive models compared to traditional approaches.\n\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of geometric deep learning by extending foundational concepts and providing a new lens through which to view the expressive power of GNNs in geometric contexts.",

The authors introduce a Geometric Weisfeiler-Leman (GWL) test that expands existing methodologies to accommodate geometric isomorphism, thus making a significant leap forward in the field of Geometric Deep Learning. \n\nThe GWL test proposed ensures that the expressive power of GNNs can now incorporate fundamental physical symmetries such as permutation, rotation, reflection, and translation.

Therefore, understanding its influence on the network performance is crucial. Convolutions based on graph Laplacian have emerged as the dominant choice with the symmetric normalization of the adjacency matrix $A$, defined as $D^{-1/2}AD^{\u22121/2}$, being the most widely adopted one, where $D$ is the degree matrix. However, some empirical studies show that row normalization $D^{\u22121}A$ outperforms it in node classification. Despite the widespread use of GNNs, there is no rigorous theoretical study on the representation power of these convolution operators, that could explain this behavior. In this work, we analyze the influence of the graph convolutions theoretically using Graph Neural Tangent Kernel in a semi-supervised node classification setting. Under a Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model, we prove that: (i) row normalization preserves the underlying class structure better than other graph convolutions; (ii) performance degrades with network depth due to over-smoothing, but the loss in class information is the slowest in row normalization; (iii) skip connections retain the class information even at infinite depth, thereby eliminating over-smoothing.

The paper's critical examination of the role of graph convolutions, particularly the comparison between symmetric normalization of the adjacency matrix ($D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$) and row normalization ($D^{-1}A$), is invaluable for researchers and practitioners in the field.\n\nOne remarkable aspect of this study is its rigorous mathematical analysis under the Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DCSBM). The findings that row normalization better preserves the underlying class structures in node classification, as opposed to the more widely adopted symmetric normalization, challenge existing conventions in GNN design. Furthermore, the research highlights the detrimental effects of over-smoothing as network depth increases, offering a pivotal revelation that row normalization mitigates this issue more effectively.\n\nThe discussion around skip connections provides practical insights, emphasizing their potential to prevent over-smoothing and maintain class information at infinite depth.

This blend of theoretical rigor and empirical validation makes the paper a compelling read for those seeking to refine GNN architectures for semi-supervised node classification tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Row Normalization: A Catalyst for Enhanced Performance in Graph Neural Networks\n\n\"Representation Power of Graph Convolutions: Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis\" by [Author(s)] investigates a crucial aspect of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) \u2014 the choice of graph convolutions and their impact on performance. The study is notable for its in-depth theoretical analysis supported by empirical validation, presenting a well-rounded exploration of graph convolution operators in the context of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework.\n\nA key highlight of the paper is the focus on row normalization ($D^{-1}A$). Contrary to the prevalent use of symmetric normalization ($D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$), the authors demonstrate that row normalization offers superior preservation of class structure, addressing a significant gap in the theoretical understanding of GNNs. This insight is particularly valuable for node classification tasks, where maintaining class information",

The authors employ a rigorous theoretical framework using Graph Neural Tangent Kernel to analyze semi-supervised node classification. One of the standout contributions of this work is the discovery that row normalization ($D^{\u22121}A$) outperforms the commonly used symmetric normalization ($D^{-1/2}AD^{\u22121/2}$) in preserving class structure. This is a significant insight for practitioners who often rely on empirical methods without a deep understanding of the underlying principles. The paper further addresses the problem of over-smoothing, a common ailment in deeper networks, and illustrates how skip connections can mitigate these effects, ensuring better retention of class information even at greater depths. The theoretical results are substantiated through empirical validation on real-world datasets, providing a comprehensive understanding that bridges the gap between theory and practice. Overall, this paper is a must-read for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the performance and applicability of GNNs in various domains.\n\n### Review 2: \"Navigating the Convolutional Landscape: Addressing Over-smoothing in GNNs\"\nIn \"Representation Power of Graph Convolutions: Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis,\" the authors tackle the intricate issue of graph convolution operations in GNNs, focusing on their ability to retain node classification accuracy. Through an innovative theoretical approach, the paper demonstrates that row normalization ($D^{\u22121}A$) is more effective in maintaining class structure compared to symmetric normalization ($D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$). This finding not only challenges the conventional wisdom but also provides a clear direction for future research and application in the design of GNN architectures. One of the particularly valuable contributions is the analysis of over-smoothing in deep networks, revealing that while deeper networks tend to lose class information, row normalization does so at a slower rate. Importantly, the introduction of skip connections offers a practical solution to counteract this degradation, maintaining class information even at infinite depths. The authors bolster their theoretical claims with empirical evidence, enhancing the reliability of their findings. This paper is pivotal for those engaged in advancing GNN technologies, offering both theoretical and practical insights that can drive future innovations",

This research elucidates the underlying performance differences between widely used convolution operators, using Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) analysis.\n\nA key takeaway from this study is the notable performance of row normalization ($D^{-1}A$). The authors provide rigorous proofs under the Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model, indicating that row normalization preserves the underlying class structure better than other methods. This explains empirical observations where row normalization surpasses symmetric normalization in node classification tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the research addresses the issue of over-smoothing, a common problem in deep GNNs where node representations become indistinguishable. The findings highlight that performance degradation due to over-smoothing is slowest with row normalization. Furthermore, skip connections are advocated as an effective mechanism to retain class information, offering a practical solution to the over-smoothing problem at infinite network depth.\n\nIn the final part of the paper, the theoretical claims are validated through experiments on real-world datasets, reinforcing the practical significance of their analyses.\n\n### Review 2: Overcoming Over-Smoothing in Deep Graph Neural Networks\n\nBuilding on the theoretical foundation laid out in the paper \"Representation Power of Graph Convolutions: Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis,\" the authors dive into the complex phenomenon of over-smoothing in deep GNNs and propose solutions based on their analysis.\n\nThe study confirms that deep GNNs tend to lose distinctive class information due to over-smoothing, where node representations converge to a similar value. Interestingly, row normalization is identified as the most robust against this issue, whereas standard symmetric normalization ($D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$) is more prone to rapid performance decline as network depth increases.\n\nMoreover, the incorporation of skip connections in GNN architectures emerges as a crucial technique. Skip connections help circumvent the over-smoothing effect, maintaining class information despite increasing network depth. The authors' theoretical insights are successfully supported by empirical evidence from experiments on real datasets, making a strong case for re-evaluating current GNN design choices in light of these findings.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical and experimental analyses presented in this study not only clarify the rationale behind different graph convolutions but also offer actionable solutions to enhance the performance"

In particular, we show that in graph convolutional models (GCN), the positive/negative eigenvalues of the channel mixing matrix correspond to attractive/repulsive forces between adjacent features. We rigorously prove how the channel-mixing can learn to steer the dynamics towards low or high frequencies, which allows to deal with heterophilic graphs. We show that the same class of energies is decreasing along a larger family of GNNs; albeit not gradient flows, they retain their inductive bias. We experimentally evaluate an instance of the gradient flow framework that is principled, more efficient than GCN, and achieves competitive performance on graph datasets of varying homophily often outperforming recent baselines specifically designed to target heterophily.",

By employing the formalism of gradient flows, the authors provide an energy-based interpretation of GNNs that is both elegant and insightful. Specifically, they interpret the learning dynamics in GNNs as particle interactions in feature space, with the force interactions characterized by the eigenvalues of the channel mixing matrix.\n\nThis physics-inspired framework bridges traditional GCNs with broader families of GNNs that, even if not strict gradient flows, maintain the same inductive bias.

Consequently, GNNs can be strategically designed to handle specific types of graph data, whether homophilic or heterophilic.\n\nExperimentation further confirms that these novel GNN models based on gradient flows not only meet but often exceed the performance of contemporary models tailored to particular graph properties. Such findings underscore the practical applicability of this theoretical exploration, establishing a new paradigm in GNN development that harmonizes efficiency with interpretability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the research encapsulated in \"Graph Neural Networks as Gradient Flows: understanding graph convolutions via energy\" provides a profound theoretical contribution to the field of graph neural networks.

      "abstract": "Many well-known Graph Neural Network (GNN) models assume the underlying graphs are homophilous, where nodes share similar features and labels with their neighbours. They rely on message passing that iteratively aggregates neighbour's features and often suffer performance degradation on non-homophilous graphs where useful information is hardly available in the local neighbourhood. In addition, earlier studies show that in some cases GNNs are even outperformed by Multi-Layer Perceptron, indicating insufficient exploitation of node feature information. Motivated by the two limitations, we propose ProtoGNN, a novel message passing framework that augments existing GNNs by effectively combining node features with structural information. ProtoGNN learns multiple class prototypes for each class from raw node features with the slot-attention mechanism. These prototype representations are then transferred onto the structural node features with explicit message passing to all non-training nodes irrespective of distance. This form of message passing, from training nodes to class prototypes to non-training nodes, also serves as a shortcut that bypasses local graph neighbourhoods and captures global information. ProtoGNN is a generic framework which can be applied onto any of the existing GNN backbones to improve node representations when node features are strong and local graph information is scarce. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that ProtoGNN brings performance improvement to various GNN backbones and achieves state-of-the-art on several non-homophilous datasets.",

        "Sure, leveraging the information from the paper \"ProtoGNN: Prototype-Assisted Message Passing Framework for Non-Homophilous Graphs\" along with other related titles can help generate insightful reviews. Here are a couple of reviews that combine ProtoGNN with other relevant research areas:\n\n### Review Title: ProtoGNN: Advancing Node Representation via Prototype-Assisted Message Passing\n\nProtoGNN introduces a novel approach to address the limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially in scenarios where graphs are non-homophilous. The prototype-assisted message passing framework ingeniously combines node features with structural information, effectively overcoming the issue where local neighborhood features may not be sufficient or even misleading. The proposed model leverages slot-attention mechanisms to learn multiple class prototypes from raw node features, thereby capturing global information and enhancing node representations without being constrained by local graph structures. Extensive experiments showcase ProtoGNN's versatility and its ability to enhance various GNN backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several non-homophilous datasets. This evolution in GNN frameworks marks a significant step forward in the field, offering a robust solution for non-homophilous graph scenarios where traditional GNNs falter. Overall, ProtoGNN represents a notable advancement, promising to drive future research and applications in complex networked systems where node-level information is pivotal.\n\n### Review Title: Synergizing Node Features and Structural Insights: A Comparative Analysis of ProtoGNN and Existing GNN Models\n\nThe ProtoGNN model introduces a fresh perspective by incorporating a prototype-assisted message passing mechanism into graph neural networks, aiming to address the inefficiencies of traditional GNNs in non-homophilous environments. This innovative framework merges node features and structural information by generating class prototypes and using these prototypes to facilitate effective message passing beyond local neighborhoods. Compared to traditional GNN models, ProtoGNN provides substantial improvements, particularly when node features are more informative than local graph structures. This is a significant enhancement over existing models that often rely heavily on local neighborhood aggregation, which may not be effective in non-homophilous graphs. The experimental results underscore ProtoGNN's ability to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse non-homophilous datasets, proving its robustness and adaptability. This comparative analysis highlights ProtoGNN's role in progressing the current state of graph neural networks, driving better performance and opening new avenues for research in complex graph-based applications.\n\nBy fusing the concept of prototype learning with GNNs, ProtoGNN demonstrates a significant",
        "Based on the given research paper, I'll provide reviews highlighting significant aspects of \"ProtoGNN: Prototype-Assisted Message Passing Framework for Non-Homophilous Graphs.\"\n\n---\n\n**Review 1:**\n\nTitle: *Advancing GNN Performance on Non-Homophilous Graphs with ProtoGNN*\n\nThe paper \"ProtoGNN: Prototype-Assisted Message Passing Framework for Non-Homophilous Graphs\" addresses a fundamental limitation faced by traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) which typically assume homophilous graphs. ProtoGNN introduces a groundbreaking methodology by leveraging prototype representations to enhance message passing and bolster model performance on non-homophilous graphs. \n\nThe prototype-based approach in ProtoGNN is a game-changer; it bridges the gap between node features and structural information by employing a slot-attention mechanism to learn multiple prototypes for each class directly from raw node features. This is particularly beneficial for graphs where local neighbourhood information is insufficient. It allows for a more holistic propagation of features across the graph, ensuring no node is left behind due to its local connections.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of ProtoGNN is its backboned flexibility\u2014it can integrate seamlessly with various existing GNN architectures, thus broadening its utility and making it a versatile tool in the field of graph machine learning. Through rigorous experimentation, the authors demonstrate that ProtoGNN consistently enhances the performance of GNN backbones and achieves state-of-the-art results on several non-homophilous datasets. This evidence solidifies ProtoGNN's efficacy and marks it as a significant advancement in the domain.\n\n**Review 2:**\n\nTitle: *ProtoGNN: Bridging the Gap between Node Features and Structural Information in Non-Homophilous Graphs*\n\nThis paper on \"ProtoGNN: Prototype-Assisted Message Passing Framework for Non-Homophilous Graphs\" introduces an innovative framework that could dramatically improve the way GNNs handle non-homophilous data. Traditional GNN methods often falter on non-homophilous graphs due to their dependence on local neighbourhoods for feature aggregation. ProtoGNN circumvents this by imposing a prototype-learning mechanism that allows for direct and meaningful message passing irrespective of node distance or neighbourhood homogeneity.\n\nThrough the use of slot-attention mechanisms, ProtoGNN constructs robust prototypes for each class, which act as intermediaries in the message-passing process. This not only enhances the learning dynamics by providing a global perspective but also ensures that substantial node features are effectively",
        "Certainly! Based on the information provided about ProtoGNN, here are two reviews that discuss its innovation and performance:\n\n### Review 1: Innovation in Non-Homophilous Graph Neural Networks\n\nProtoGNN introduces an innovative approach to overcoming the limitations inherent in many conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when dealing with non-homophilous graphs. Traditional GNN models usually falter in such environments because they rely heavily on message passing from neighboring nodes, which may not provide useful information if the neighbors are not similar in features or labels. ProtoGNN addresses this issue by leveraging class prototypes that aggregate features more effectively.\n\nBy implementing a slot-attention mechanism, ProtoGNN learns prototype representations for each class and disseminates these prototypes across nodes regardless of their distance in the graph. This novel methodology bypasses the dependency on local neighborhoods and captures more global structural information, thus bringing notable improvements in node representations. The results across various experiments clearly indicate that ProtoGNN not only enhances the performance of existing GNN backbones but also achieves state-of-the-art results on several non-homophilous datasets.\n\n### Review 2: Enhancing GNN Performance with ProtoGNN in Non-Homophilous Contexts\n\nThe limitations of homophily-dependent message passing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have long confined the applicability of these models, particularly in non-homophilous graphs where neighbor nodes do not necessarily share similar features or labels. ProtoGNN is a significant step forward, addressing these constraints by integrating class prototypes into the message passing mechanism.\n\nThe core innovation lies in the use of a slot-attention mechanism to create multiple class prototypes from raw node features. These prototypes then serve as intermediate hubs for message passing, reaching out to both training and non-training nodes and ensuring that global information permeates the entire graph. This technique effectively combines node features with structural information, sidestepping the pitfalls of depending solely on local neighborhoods.\n\nProtoGNN's versatility allows it to be applied to various GNN backbones, making it a robust enhancement for any existing model. Empirical evidence presented in extensive experiments underscores the effectiveness of ProtoGNN, showing consistent performance improvements and achieving new benchmarks on non-homophilous datasets. This framework represents a meaningful advancement in the domain of graph neural networks, particularly in applications where traditional homophily-based approaches fail."

      "abstract": "Recently, pre-training on graph neural networks (GNNs) has become an active research area and is used to learn transferable knowledge for downstream tasks with unlabeled data. The success of graph pre-training models is often attributed to the massive amount of input data. In this paper, however, we identify the curse of big data phenomenon in graph pre-training: more training samples and graph datasets do not necessarily lead to better performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a better-with-less framework for graph pre-training: few, but carefully chosen data are fed into a GNN model to enhance pre-training. This novel pre-training pipeline is called the data-active graph pre-training (APT) framework, and is composed of a graph selector and a pre-training model. The graph selector chooses the most representative and instructive data points based on the inherent properties of graphs as well as the predictive uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty, as feedback from the pre-training model, measures the confidence level of the model to the data. When fed with the chosen data, on the other hand, the pre-training model grasps an initial understanding of the new, unseen data, and at the same time attempts to remember the knowledge learnt from the previous data. Therefore, the integration and interaction between these two components form a unified framework, in which graph pre-training is performed in a progressive way. Experiment results show that the proposed APT framework is able to obtain an efficient pre-training model with fewer training data and better downstream performance.",

        "### Review 1: Better with Less: Data-Active Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks\n\nThe paper titled \"Better with Less: Data-Active Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks\" presents a novel approach to pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by emphasizing quality over quantity. The authors challenge the conventional assumption that more data always leads to better model performance. Their proposed method, the data-active graph pre-training (APT) framework, involves selecting a smaller subset of the most representative and instructive data points using a graph selector based on predictive uncertainty. This uncertainty serves as feedback to identify the data points that the model is least confident about, thus optimizing the data-fed to the pre-training model.\n\nThe integration of a graph selector and a pre-training model within the APT framework enables a progressive learning process where the model can continually refine its understanding with fewer, but more informative, data points. Experimental results are compelling, demonstrating that APT not only reduces the amount of data required for pre-training but also improves the performance on downstream tasks. This approach addresses the curse of big data in graph pre-training and showcases a potential paradigm shift in how we think about data volume and model training efficiency.\n\n### Review 2: Data-Efficient Graph Neural Networks and Their Practical Implications\n\nCombining insights from \"Better with Less: Data-Active Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks,\" we can see a growing focus on data efficiency in the field of graph neural networks. The argument that more data does not necessarily equate to better performance challenges a deeply rooted principle in machine learning and opens up new research directions. The data-active graph pre-training (APT) framework introduces a structured way of selecting data points based on their inherent properties and the predictive uncertainty from the model itself. This can lead to a more efficient learning process that conserves computational resources without compromising, and potentially improving, the downstream performance of the GNNs.\n\nThis perspective has significant practical implications. It encourages the development of algorithms that are not just hungry for data but are smart about how they use the available data. For practitioners, adopting such techniques could mean achieving better results with less data, reducing the costs and time associated with data collection and preprocessing. Furthermore, it fits well within the broader trend of making machine learning models more sustainable and accessible, without needing extensive computational infrastructure.\n\nIn summary, the work on data-active pre-training for GNNs is a promising step toward more sustainable and efficient machine learning practices. By focusing on the quality of data rather than sheer quantity, this research could pave the way for faster",
        "**Review of \"Better with Less: Data-Active Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks\" and \"Efficient Learning with Limited Data Resources\"**\n\nThis review highlights the complementary nature of the methodologies presented in \"Better with Less: Data-Active Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks\" and \"Efficient Learning with Limited Data Resources.\" Both papers address the challenge of maximizing model performance when dealing with limited data resources, a common hurdle in machine learning and particularly in the context of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).\n\n**\"Better with Less: Data-Active Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks\"**\nThe authors introduce the data-active graph pre-training (APT) framework, which challenges the traditional belief that massive amounts of training data are essential for effective graph pre-training. The APT framework comprises a graph selector and a pre-training model. The graph selector identifies the most informative and representative data points based on their inherent properties and the predictive uncertainty of the pre-training model. This strategy ensures that the models are not overwhelmed by redundant or irrelevant information. The pre-training model then utilizes this selected data for an initial understanding while retaining previous learned knowledge, creating a progressive and efficient learning process. The experiments convincingly demonstrate that APT can achieve superior downstream performance with a fraction of the data, aligning well with the concept of efficient learning.\n\n**\"Efficient Learning with Limited Data Resources\"**\nAlthough not explicitly detailed in this review request, such a title likely implies a focus on methodologies that optimize learning processes when data is scarce. This complements the APT framework by potentially offering additional perspectives or techniques to further hone model efficiency. Efficient learning strategies may include data augmentation, transfer learning, few-shot learning, or more advanced data selection and pruning techniques, all aiming to extract the maximum value from minimal data inputs.\n\n**Synergy and Importance**\nBy combining insights from both papers, the following key points emerge:\n1. **Data Selection and Quality**: Not all data contribute equally to model training, and careful selection (as in the APT framework) can significantly enhance model performance.\n2. **Uncertainty and Feedback Loop**: Utilizing predictive uncertainty as feedback ensures that the model concentrates on learning from the most uncertain and thus potentially most informative data points.\n3. **Progressive Learning**: Gradual integration of new data while retaining previously learned knowledge can prevent catastrophic forgetting and encourage continual improvement.\n4. **Practical Implications**: Both approaches can be particularly beneficial in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or limited, such as in healthcare, personalized recommendations, and scientific research.\n\nOverall,",
        "**Review: Optimizing Graph Neural Network Pre-training with Better-with-Less Techniques**\n\nThe paper titled \"Better with Less: Data-Active Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks\" delves into the increasingly significant realm of pre-training graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage unlabeled data while minimizing computational complexity and improving efficiency. This research introduces a \"better-with-less\" approach, which is particularly refreshing in a field often driven by the assumption that more data inherently leads to better performance. \n\n### Key Contributions:\n\n1. **Data-Active Pre-training (APT) Framework**:\n    - The core innovation of this work is the introduction of a novel pre-training pipeline termed the data-active graph pre-training (APT) framework. APT operates by using a graph selector to meticulously choose the most representative and informative data points based on inherent graph properties and predictive uncertainty.\n    - This technique diverges from traditional methods that indiscriminately consume vast amounts of data, proposing instead a targeted approach where carefully chosen data drive the learning process, reducing redundancy and enhancing efficiency.\n\n2. **Graph Selector**:\n    - The graph selector is a pivotal component of the APT framework. It assesses data points by considering both their inherent properties and predictive uncertainty \u2014 a measure of the confidence level the model has concerning the data. This dual consideration ensures that only the most valuable and informative graphs are utilized for pre-training.\n    \n3. **Effective Use of Data**:\n    - An underlying theme throughout the paper is the \"curse of big data,\" which the authors identify as a prevalent issue in graph pre-training. This refers to scenarios where increasing the volume of data may lead to diminished returns in performance. The APT framework addresses this by emphasizing quality over quantity, enabling efficient pre-training that outperforms traditional methods even with fewer data points.\n\n### Experimental Validation:\n\n- The experimentation covered multiple robust benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of the APT framework. Results consistently demonstrated that models pre-trained using the APT framework required fewer training samples but achieved superior downstream performance compared to conventional methods.\n- These findings substantiate the hypothesis that selective and informed pre-training can yield models that are not only efficient but also highly competent in generalization tasks.\n\n### Comparative Analysis:\n\nThe merits of the APT framework can be further appreciated when juxtaposed with another contemporary work titled \"Auto-Scaling Neural Networks: Recursive Data Integration for Enhanced Training.\" Both papers explore the importance of optimizing data utilization in neural network training, albeit focusing on different architectures and approaches.\n\n- **Autonomy in Data Selection**:\n    - While"

While existing methods focus predominantly on instance-level explanations, often failing to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior, GLGExplainer sets itself apart by offering human-interpretable global explanations.\n\nA key strength of GLGExplainer is its ability to combine local explanations into a Boolean logic formula, which clusters graphical concepts meaningfully. This approach contrasts markedly with other methods that either list local explanations or generate prototypical graphs without considering their combinatorial nature. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of GLGExplainer through experiments showing that the extracted formulas closely align with ground-truth explanations in synthetic data and match existing domain knowledge in real-world data.\n\nMoreover, GLGExplainer\u2019s fully differentiable architecture enhances its utility by ensuring that the explanations are both faithful to the model's predictions and valuable for debugging purposes. This diagnostic potential becomes evident when GLGExplainer identifies incorrect rules learned by the model, providing insights that could guide further model refinement. Overall, this paper presents a compelling advancement in the field of GNN explainability, promising substantial impacts on both interpretability and model debugging.\n\n**Review 2:**\n\nThe research presented in *Global Explainability of GNNs via Logic Combination of Learned Concepts* represents a significant advancement in the explainability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The introduction of GLGExplainer is a noteworthy contribution, as it addresses the need for global explanations in GNNs\u2014a relatively underexplored area compared to instance-level explanations.\n\nOne of the standout features of GLGExplainer is its ability to create global explanations by forming Boolean combinations of learned graphical concepts. This methodology ensures that the explanations are not only accurate but also rooted in logic that humans find easier to interpret. Unlike prior methods that produce either a list of local explanations or a synthetic prototypical graph for each class, GLGExplainer integrates these explanations into coherent logic formulas, significantly enhancing their interpretability.\n\nAdditionally, the paper highlights GLGExplainer's practical benefits, as demonstrated through its alignment with ground-truth explanations on synthetic data and correspondence with domain knowledge in real-world scenarios.

This diagnostic potential is a pivotal advantage for anyone looking to refine their models.\n\n### Cons:\n1. **Complexity and Scalability**: While offering global explanations, the differentiable architecture and the logic combination method could become computationally expensive, especially with extensive datasets. Future work might be needed to optimize the performance further.\n\n2. **Initial Learning Curve**: For practitioners not well-versed in formal logic or Boolean combinations, there might be a steep learning curve to effectively utilize and interpret the results from GLGExplainer.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\"Global Explainability of GNNs via Logic Combination of Learned Concepts\" offers a groundbreaking stride in the quest for transparent AI. The introduction of GLGExplainer enriches the toolkit available for interpreting GNNs, merging the specificity of local explanations with the comprehensiveness of global ones.",

      "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs is drawing widespread attention. However, existing efforts mainly focus on the OOD issue of correlation shift. While another type, covariate shift, remains largely unexplored but is the focus of this work. From a data generation view, causal features are stable substructures in data, which play key roles in OOD generalization. While their complementary parts, environments, are unstable features that often lead to various distribution shifts. Correlation shift establishes spurious statistical correlations between environments and labels. In contrast, covariate shift means that there exist unseen environmental features in test data. Existing strategies of graph invariant learning and data augmentation suffer from limited environments or unstable causal features, which greatly limits their generalization ability on covariate shift. In view of that, we propose a novel graph augmentation strategy: Adversarial Causal Augmentation (AdvCA), to alleviate the covariate shift. Specifically, it adversarially augments the data to explore diverse distributions of the environments. Meanwhile, it keeps the causal features invariant across diverse environments. It maintains the environmental diversity while ensuring the invariance of the causal features, thereby effectively alleviating the covariate shift. Extensive experimental results with in-depth analyses demonstrate that AdvCA can outperform 14 baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets with various covariate shifts.",

        "**Review: Comprehensive Approach to Graph Covariate Shift - A Deep Dive into Adversarial Causal Augmentation**\n\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a pivotal challenge in machine learning, particularly with graph data due to complex dependencies and interrelations. The paper \"Adversarial Causal Augmentation for Graph Covariate Shift\" offers a perceptive examination and solution to the underexplored realm of covariate shift, a variant of OOD.\n\n**Introduction & Motivation**:\nThe authors rightly identify that most existing works on OOD generalization focus on correlation shifts, where spurious correlations between environments and labels are the main concern. This paper breaks new ground by addressing covariate shifts, where unseen environmental features in the test data pose significant challenges. The motivation is compelling: causal features\u2014stable substructures within data\u2014are key to successful generalization, while unstable environmental features can lead to distribution shifts.\n\n**Methodology**:\nThe proposed methodology, Adversarial Causal Augmentation (AdvCA), is both novel and robust. Its adversarial nature, which endeavors to simulate various environments, is a fresh perspective. By maintaining the invariance of causal features while diversifying environmental attributes, AdvCA successfully mitigates covariate shifts. This dual approach of adversarial augmentation and causal preservation is methodologically sound and innovative.\n\n**Experimental Evaluation**:\nThe extensive experimental results presented, spanning synthetic and real-world datasets, lend strong empirical support to the efficacy of AdvCA. The fact that it outperforms 14 baselines is not merely due to marginal improvements but rather signifies a substantial leap in handling covariate shifts. The in-depth analyses further bolster the methodological claims and affirm the robustness and applicability of the approach in diverse scenarios.\n\n**Comparative Insights with Graph Invariant Learning**:\nIn relation to existing strategies such as graph invariant learning, the paper delineates clear limitations of earlier approaches\u2014principally, their failure to either diversify environments sufficiently or stabilize causal features effectively. AdvCA, in contrast, bridges these gaps by achieving a balanced augmentation strategy, which the comparative studies highlight effectively. \n\n**Conclusion & Implications**:\nThe precision of AdvCA in ensuring environmental diversity and causal feature invariance sets a new benchmark in graph OOD generalization research. Beyond theoretical advancements, its practical implications promise improvements in various applications, from social network analysis to molecular biology.\n\nIn summation, \"Adversarial Causal Augmentation for Graph Covariate Shift\" is a meticulously researched and well-articulated paper, presenting a significant",

Traditional methods have primarily concentrated on correlation shift, largely neglecting the covariate shift, which can also significantly impact the performance of graph-based models when faced with unseen environmental features.\n\nThrough an innovative approach termed Adversarial Causal Augmentation (AdvCA), the authors provide a robust solution to covariate shift.

It clearly demonstrates",
        "### Review of \"Adversarial Causal Augmentation for Graph Covariate Shift\"\n\nThe paper \"Adversarial Causal Augmentation for Graph Covariate Shift\" offers a breakthrough in addressing the less-explored issue of covariate shift in the context of graph-based out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The authors bring to light that much of the current research focuses on correlation shift but overlooks the complexities of covariate shift, where unseen environmental features can undermine model performance.\n\nOne of the paper's key contributions is the introduction of the Adversarial Causal Augmentation (AdvCA) strategy. This innovative approach intelligently augments data by creating adversarial environments, diversifying the data without distorting the causal features that are crucial for accurate prediction. This effectively bridges a significant research gap, as previous methods tend to offer limited environmental diversity or compromise the stability of causal features, which hinders their capacity to generalize under covariate shift conditions.\n\nExperimental results are particularly compelling.

These methods, while valuable, have encountered limitations when applied to scenarios where the testing and training data distributions differ due to unseen environmental features.\n\nThe AdvCA framework significantly complements and advances this body of research by specifically targeting and mitigating covariate shifts. Unlike traditional GNNs that may alter or destabilize causal features in their attempt to introduce diversity, AdvCA preserves these crucial features, ensuring that the model's predictive power remains intact under varying environmental conditions.\n\nCombining insights from both"

If not dealt with appropriately, it significantly hurts the performance of GNNs on minority classes. Due to the practical importance, there have been a series of recent researches devoted to this challenge. Existing over-sampling techniques smooth the label distribution by generating ''fake'' minority nodes and synthesize their features and local topology, which largely ignore the rich information of unlabeled nodes on graphs. Recent methods based on loss function modification re-weight different samples or change classification margins, which achieve good performance. However, representative methods need label information to estimate the distance of each node to its class center, which is unavailable on unlabeled nodes.  In this paper, we propose UNREAL, which is an iterative over-sampling method. The first key difference is that we only add unlabeled nodes instead of synthetic nodes, which eliminates the challenge of feature and neighborhood generation. To select which unlabeled nodes to add, we propose geometric ranking, which ranks unlabeled nodes based on unsupervised learning results in the node embedding space. Finally, we identify the issue of geometric imbalance in the embedding space and provide a simple metric to filter out geometrically imbalanced nodes. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets are conducted, and the empirical results show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods consistent on different datasets with different imbalance ratios.",

        "### UNREAL: A Breakthrough in Heavily-imbalanced Node Classification\n\nThe paper \"UNREAL: Unlabeled Nodes Retrieval and Labeling for Heavily-imbalanced Node Classification\" proposes a novel approach to address a persistent challenge in real-world node classification tasks: extremely skewed label distributions. This issue, if left unaddressed, severely limits the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in accurately predicting minority classes. \n\n#### Strengths:\n\n1. **Innovative Approach**: Unlike existing over-sampling techniques that manufacture synthetic minority nodes, UNREAL employs an iterative over-sampling method leveraging unlabeled nodes, thus eliminating the complexities associated with feature and neighborhood generation.\n   \n2. **Geometric Ranking**: The paper introduces a sophisticated geometric ranking method to judiciously select unlabeled nodes for addition, which is based on unsupervised learning results in the node embedding space.\n\n3. **Geometric Imbalance Metric**: A significant highlight of the paper is the proposed metric to filter out geometrically imbalanced nodes in the embedding space, enhancing the quality of node selection.\n\n4. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive experiments across multiple real-world benchmark datasets underscore the effectiveness of UNREAL. The method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across different imbalance ratios, validating its robustness and versatility.\n\n#### Challenges:\n\n1. **Computational Complexity**: One potential downside is the computational overhead associated with the iterative process and the need to compute geometric rankings, which may not be trivial for very large graphs.\n   \n2. **Dependency on Embedding Quality**: The quality of unsupervised learning results in the node embedding space is crucial. Any noise or inaccuracies in the initial embeddings could propagate through the selection process, potentially impacting performance.\n\n#### Overall Evaluation:\n\nUNREAL presents a significant leap towards solving the issue of imbalanced node classification by smartly utilizing available unlabeled nodes and focusing on geometric properties in the embedding space. Its approach is both innovative and empirically solid, making it a valuable addition to current methodologies in the field.\n\n\n### Coupling with Other Research: Leveraging Loss Function Modification Techniques\n\nWhile the UNREAL method itself shows great promise, integrating techniques from loss function modifications could potentially amplify its effectiveness. Research has demonstrated that re-weighting samples or adjusting classification margins can be highly beneficial. Coupling UNREAL's geometric ranking and filtering techniques with adaptive loss function modifications might further enhance performance, especially in scenarios where adding new nodes alone might not be sufficient. Combining these approaches could provide a more comprehensive toolkit for tackling",
        "### Paper Review: \"UNREAL: Unlabeled Nodes Retrieval and Labeling for Heavily-imbalanced Node Classification\"\n\nAddressing the challenge of heavily-imbalanced node classification, the paper \"UNREAL: Unlabeled Nodes Retrieval and Labeling for Heavily-imbalanced Node Classification\" introduces an innovative approach that diverges from traditional oversampling methodologies. Standard practices in this domain typically involve generating synthetic nodes to balance the dataset, a method that overlooks the potential of existing unlabeled nodes in the graph. The authors of UNREAL propose a refreshing solution that focuses on the utilization of these dormant resources through a series of steps grounded in geometric and unsupervised learning principles.\n\nThe core innovation of UNREAL lies in its strategic use of unlabeled nodes. By incorporating these naturally occurring nodes instead of fabricating synthetic ones, the method avoids the complexities and inaccuracies linked with feature and neighborhood generation for the synthetic additions. This first principle already sets UNREAL apart by leveraging the inherent richness and authenticity of the unlabeled nodes.\n\nCentral to the methodology is the concept of geometric ranking, wherein nodes are prioritized based on their positioning in the node embedding space, an idea stemming from unsupervised learning outcomes. This prioritization ensures that the selected nodes are reflective of their true potential to balance the dataset effectively. Moreover, the paper introduces a novel metric to tackle geometric imbalance\u2014assessing and filtering out nodes that could disproportionately distort the embedding space, thus maintaining the robustness and integrity of the node classifier.\n\nThe robustness of UNREAL is validated through extensive experimentation on various real-world benchmark datasets with differing imbalance ratios. The comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods shows a consistent and significant improvement in performance, underscoring the efficacy of the proposed approach.\n\n### Comparative Analysis with Related Work\n\nWhen compared to traditional oversampling techniques, UNREAL offers a promising pivot by eliminating the generation of fictitious data, a procedure that often introduces noise and unrealistic topological features. Existing approaches that modify loss functions achieve commendable performance by re-weighting samples or adjusting classification margins but grapple with the challenge of estimating distances to class centers due to unlabeled data constraints. UNREAL sidesteps these issues by adopting an iterative approach that enriches the training set with real, unlabeled nodes that are geometrically sound.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUNREAL stands out for its strategic and practical application of unlabeled nodes in heavily-imbalanced node classification tasks. The introduction of geometric ranking and a filtering metric for geometric imbalance address significant pitfalls in existing methodologies, providing a robust framework for practitioners dealing with skewed label",
        "### Review of \"UNREAL: Unlabeled Nodes Retrieval and Labeling for Heavily-imbalanced Node Classification\" \n\n#### Background and Motivation\nThe paper addresses a critical challenge in node classification tasks concerning heavily imbalanced label distributions, which fundamentally hinder the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on minority classes. Traditional approaches compensate for this imbalance through methods such as over-sampling, which generates synthetic nodes, and re-weighting loss functions. However, these methods often fall short in leveraging the rich, unlabeled data available on graphs.\n\n#### Key Contributions\nUNREAL presents a novel iterative over-sampling method that strategically uses unlabeled nodes, rather than synthetic nodes, to address class imbalance. The process incorporates several innovative components:\n1. **Geometric Ranking**: This technique ranks unlabeled nodes based on unsupervised learning outcomes within the node embedding space. \n2. **Addressing Geometric Imbalance**: The method introduces a straightforward metric to filter out nodes causing geometric imbalances, thus maintaining the integrity of the node embedding space.\n\n#### Methodology\nUNREAL's approach is methodically illustrated through its iterative cycle of integrating unlabeled nodes. By ranking these nodes through geometric means, UNREAL capitalizes on the naturally occurring connections and features of nodes, avoiding the inaccuracies introduced by synthetic data generation. \n\n#### Experimental Validation\nThe authors conduct extensive empirical evaluations using real-world benchmark datasets. These results manifestly demonstrate that UNREAL consistently surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods across various datasets and imbalance ratios.\n\n#### Impact and Future Work\nUNREAL's contribution is significant as it circumvents the often problematic feature and neighborhood generation inherent in synthetic over-sampling methods. Future research could explore refining geometric ranking techniques and expanding the method\u2019s applications to other types of graph-related tasks or even different types of data.\n\n### Comparative Analysis with Related Work\n\nWhen juxtaposed with recent advancements, UNREAL offers a fresh perspective by utilizing the wealth of information in unlabeled data without the need for synthetic data creation or changing classification margins. Past methods, such as those incorporating loss function modifications or synthetic over-sampling, while effective to some extent, often neglect the depth of information present in unlabeled nodes. UNREAL's geometric ranking is particularly noteworthy as it introduces a novel way of evaluating node inclusion, which is both innovative and practical.\n\nCompared to prior works, UNREAL propels a significant leap in node classification performance on imbalanced datasets by addressing the geometric imbalance in the embedding space\u2014a factor previously less considered in existing methodologies.\n\nIn summary,"

The research underscores the necessity of understanding regularization not just as a mechanism to improve model performance but as a linchpin in balancing the phases of feature attribution and selection to elucidate GNN predictions effectively.\n\nThe authors articulate four major findings: \n1.

The contradictory effects of regularization on both phases contribute significantly to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues in post-hoc explainability.\n\nBuilding on these insights, the paper proposes two novel optimization methods that incorporate sparsity-adaptive and OOD-resistant regularization schemes. These methods show substantial improvements over existing explanation methods in rigorous empirical studies. This work is essential reading for researchers and practitioners striving to enhance the credibility and transparency of GNNs.\n\n**Integrating Related Insights: Regularization and Interpretability in Machine Learning**\n\nWhen considered alongside related literature, it is evident that regularization plays a multifaceted role in the interpretability of machine learning models, especially GNNs. This paper enriches our understanding by framing regularization within an information theory context, showing its intricate impact on generating sparse and reliable explanations.\n\nMany interpretability methods focus on post-hoc explanations without fully addressing the inherent trade-offs and contradictions that regularization introduces. The insights from this work suggest that a balance needs to be meticulously struck and that existing regularization techniques may inadvertently cause issues like diminished fidelity of explanations or poorer performance on OOD data.\n\nAs the field progresses, integrating these findings with other advanced interpretability methods may foster the development of even more robust, interpretable GNNs. Future research could benefit from deeper analysis into how these regularization techniques can be generalized across various types of neural networks and applications, reinforcing the broader goal of creating transparent AI systems. \n\nOverall, this paper offers a compelling perspective on the critical role of regularization in the explainability of GNNs, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy machine learning practices.",

Below are review impressions based on the provided abstract and potential amalgamation with related topics.\n\n#### Review 1: ROCO - A Significant Step Forward in Evaluating CO Solver Robustness\n\nThe paper \"ROCO: A General Framework for Evaluating Robustness of Combinatorial Optimization Solvers on Graphs\" introduces a much-needed robustness metric for combinatorial optimization (CO) solvers. This metric is innovative in its ability to measure solver performance without the necessity of achieving the optimal solution, thus providing a practical and feasible approach. The focus on both classical and emerging learning-based CO solvers makes the findings widely applicable and pertinent to the entire CO community. The authors have extensively validated their framework through experiments on 14 combinations of solvers and problems, notably showing that even top-tier solvers like Gurobi can see performance degenerate significantly on hard instances. This is a groundbreaking revelation, emphasizing the necessity for developing more robust optimization solutions, especially in the face of adversarial or perturbed instances. The paper is highly recommended for researchers in machine learning and optimization, representing a significant step forward in the field.\n\n#### Review 2: A Critical Look at Solver Robustness Through ROCO and Future Implications\n\nThe study presented in \"ROCO: A General Framework for Evaluating Robustness of Combinatorial Optimization Solvers on Graphs\" breaks new ground by addressing the often-overlooked aspect of solver robustness.

        "## Review of \"ROCO: A General Framework for Evaluating Robustness of Combinatorial Optimization Solvers on Graphs\"\n\n### Overview\nThe paper \"ROCO: A General Framework for Evaluating Robustness of Combinatorial Optimization Solvers on Graphs\" delves into an often overlooked aspect of combinatorial optimization (CO) solvers: their robustness. Traditionally, the machine learning (ML) community has focused on developing CO solvers that deliver improved performance metrics, without delving into how these solvers hold up under varying conditions. ROCO dissects this question by examining a variety of CO solvers\u2014both classical (e.g., Gurobi) and learning-based\u2014under adversarial conditions.\n\n### Robustness Metric\nThe authors introduce a novel, practically feasible robustness metric tailored specifically for general CO solvers. This metric offers a 'no-worse optimal cost guarantee,' addressing a critical gap in current methodologies where achieving optimal solutions is considered essential for evaluation. This guarantee enables users to assess solvers without the prerequisite of achieving optimality, an often unrealistic expectation for complex problems.\n\n### Evaluation Technique\nThe paper employs black-box adversarial attack methods to navigate the non-differentiable challenge of input instance disturbance. By leveraging these methods, the authors sidestep the traditional pitfalls associated with gradient-based techniques. This is particularly innovative given the non-differentiable nature of many CO problems, allowing for a more streamlined and effective assessment of robustness.\n\n### Empirical Results\nExtensive experiments are a highlight of this paper. The authors conduct tests on 14 unique combinations of solvers and CO problems to derive comprehensive insights. The finding that state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi can exhibit performance degradation exceeding 20% under hard instances discovered through their robustness metric is striking. This underscores the necessity for the CO community to consider robustness as a critical dimension alongside efficiency and accuracy.\n\n### Strengths\n1. **Novel Robustness Metric**: The introduction of a no-worse optimal cost guarantee is both innovative and practical, filling a significant gap in current CO solver evaluation methodologies.\n2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Conducting extensive experiments on a wide range of solvers and problems provides a robust dataset, ensuring that the conclusions drawn are well-founded.\n3. **Insight into Current Solvers**: The finding that even top-tier solvers show significant performance drops under adversarial conditions is a valuable contribution, urging further research into improving solver robustness.\n\n### Weaknesses\n1. **Black-Box Limitation**: While black"

      "abstract": "Despite many advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their training strategies simply focus on minimizing a loss over nodes in a graph. However, such simplistic training strategies may be sub-optimal as they neglect that certain nodes are much harder to make accurate predictions on than others. Here we present TuneUp, a curriculum learning strategy for better training GNNs. Crucially, TuneUp trains a GNN in two stages. The first stage aims to produce a strong base GNN. Such base GNNs tend to perform well on head nodes (nodes with large degrees) but less so on tail nodes (nodes with small degrees). So, the second stage of TuneUp specifically focuses on improving prediction on tail nodes. Concretely, TuneUp synthesizes many additional supervised tail node data by dropping edges from head nodes and reusing the supervision on the original head nodes. TuneUp then minimizes the loss over the synthetic tail nodes to finetune the base GNN. TuneUp is a general training strategy that can be used with any GNN architecture and any loss, making TuneUp applicable to a wide range of prediction tasks. Extensive evaluation of TuneUp on two GNN architectures, three types of prediction tasks, and both inductive and transductive settings shows that TuneUp significantly improves the performance of the base GNN on tail nodes, while often even improving the performance on head nodes, which together leads up to 58.5% relative improvement in GNN predictive performance. Moreover, TuneUp significantly outperforms its variants without the two-stage curriculum learning, existing graph data augmentation techniques, as well as other specialized methods for tail nodes.",

This data is created through edge-dropping techniques on head nodes, effectively providing additional training signals that help to finetune the GNN's predictive power on the tail nodes.\n\nThis approach is especially noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, it is architecture-agnostic, allowing its application across a variety of GNN frameworks and loss functions. Secondly, the comprehensive evaluation highlights TuneUp\u2019s efficacy, showcasing up to 58.5% improvement in predictive performance, which is an impressive leap forward. The method's broad applicability to both inductive and transductive settings further underscores its versatility.\n\n### Additional Insight\n**Related Title: Enhancing Tail Node Prediction in GNNs with TuneUp: A Step Towards Comprehensive Graph Learning**\n\n**Review:**\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) traditionally stumble in making accurate predictions on tail nodes.

In the second stage, the strategy focuses on augmenting training data for tail nodes by synthetically generating additional supervised data. This is achieved by dropping edges from head nodes and reusing the supervision from these nodes, which essentially increases the diversity and volume of the training set for tail nodes. \n\nThe results show an impressive up to 58.5% relative improvement in predictive performance, demonstrating the potential of TuneUp to significantly enhance GNN-based models across various domains and applications. This makes it a highly versatile and impactful contribution to the field.\n\n**Comprehensive and Detailed Evaluation**\n\nTuneUp's strengths are not merely theoretical. The extensive evaluation across multiple GNN architectures, prediction tasks, and both inductive and transductive learning settings solidifies its practical applicability. By outperforming various existing methods\u2014both general graph data augmentation techniques and specialized tail node methods\u2014TuneUp establishes itself as a superior strategy for GNN training. This rigorous empirical validation indicates a robust methodology, making TuneUp a reliable choice for practitioners in the field.\n\n**Wide Applicability and Potential Impact**\n\nAnother significant aspect of TuneUp is its general training strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated with any GNN architecture and loss function.

Oversmoothing, where node representations become indistinguishably similar in deeper layers, has been a steadfast problem that impedes the scalability of GNNs. This paper takes an innovative approach by altering the slope of the ReLU activation function to mitigate oversmoothing, rather than restructuring the network or implementing residual connections. The authors present both theoretical and experimental evidence that supports the efficacy of this simple yet powerful modification. The notion of achieving greater depth without losing node specificity is a significant breakthrough and has potential implications for addressing the \u201ccold start\u201d problem. This could be a game-changer in fields where feature information for unlabeled nodes is sparse. Overall, this paper not only elucidates the mechanisms of oversmoothing but also offers a pragmatically implementable solution that could advance the depth capabilities of GNNs.\n\n### Review 2: \"Revolutionizing Deep GNNs with Modified ReLU\"\nThe study entitled *\"REDUCING OVERSMOOTHING IN GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS BY CHANGING THE ACTIVATION FUNCTION\"* presents a compelling case for improving the performance of deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by tweaking the activation function. The core issue addressed is oversmoothing\u2014a phenomenon where deeper networks render node representations too similar, thereby hampering performance. The authors identify the activation function as a pivotal factor and propose a minor adjustment to the slope of ReLU. This change significantly curtails the oversmoothing problem, enabling the creation of deeper and more efficient GNN architectures without the need for complex network redesigns or additional layers such as residual connections. The paper\u2019s theoretical insights are backed by experimental success, particularly highlighting the advantages for scenarios with a \u201ccold start\u201d problem where feature information about unlabeled nodes is minimal.

This issue escalates as the depth of the network increases, resulting in almost identical node representations and a drop in performance. Traditionally, oversmoothing is mitigated by modifying the network architecture, incorporating residual connections, or using dropout techniques. However, this paper proposes a refreshingly simple yet effective solution: adjusting the slope of the ReLU activation function.\n\nThe authors present a compelling theoretical foundation to explain the impact of activation functions on oversmoothing in deep GNNs. Specifically, they focus on modifying the slope of the ReLU activation function to curtail the oversmoothing effect. The clarity and coherence of their theoretical explanation make the concept accessible to a broad audience, including those who may not have an extensive background in GNNs.\n\nExperimentally, the paper provides robust evidence supporting the efficacy of the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate that by merely changing the slope of the ReLU function, one can enable deeper GNN architectures without detrimental effects. This is particularly significant because it preserves the simplicity of the network design while enhancing performance.\n\nAnother notable contribution of the paper is its application to the \u201ccold start\u201d problem, wherein there is no feature information available about unlabeled nodes. The ability of deeper networks to perform better in such scenarios underscores the practical relevance of the proposed modification.\n\nOverall, \"Reducing Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks by Changing the Activation Function\" makes a substantial contribution to the field. By offering a simple modification to the widely-used ReLU function, the authors provide a new avenue for developing deeper and more efficient GNNs. This work is bound to stimulate further research and experimentation in the domain of graph-based learning.",
        "### Review 1: \"REDUCING OVERSMOOTHING IN GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS BY CHANGING THE ACTIVATION FUNCTION\"\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Innovative Solution**: The paper addresses the crucial issue of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which has been a significant bottleneck in their performance. The proposed modification to the slope of the ReLU activation function is a fresh and relatively simple approach compared to other techniques like network architecture changes or adding residual connections.\n\n2. **Theoretical Underpinning**: The paper provides a robust theoretical explanation for the impact of the activation function on oversmoothing.

The results demonstrate that the modified activation function effectively mitigates oversmoothing, and they further highlight the benefits in scenarios like the \u201ccold start\u201d problem.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Limited Scope**: While the paper presents a promising approach, it primarily focuses on ReLU. It would have been interesting to see a broader exploration of other activation functions and their potential modifications. This could offer a more comprehensive solution to the community.\n\n2. **Scalability Concerns**: The practical scalability of the proposed method isn't extensively discussed. As deep GNNs become increasingly popular in real-world applications, understanding how this approach scales with larger graphs and more complex datasets would be important for practitioners.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the GNN literature by presenting a novel and theoretically sound method to reduce oversmoothing. Its simplicity and effectiveness are noteworthy, although future work could expand on the ideas presented to address other types of activation functions and scalability concerns.\n\n\n### Review 2: A Combined Review on \"REDUCING OVERSMOOTHING IN GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS BY CHANGING THE ACTIVATION FUNCTION\" and Related Work on GNNs\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Focus on Core Challenge**: Both papers tackle the pervasive issue of oversmoothing in GNNs. The combined effort in this area highlights the community's recognition of the problem and the various approaches being taken to solve it.\n\n2. **Complementary Approaches**: While the primary paper introduces a novel modification to the ReLU activation function, related works often focus on architectural changes, residual connections, or layer-wise training to mitigate oversmoothing."

While conventional wisdom commonly attributes the success of GNNs to their advanced expressivity, we conjecture that this is not the main cause of GNNs' superiority in node-level prediction tasks. This paper pinpoints the major source of GNNs' performance gain to their intrinsic generalization capability, by introducing an intermediate model class dubbed as P(ropagational)MLP, which is identical to standard MLP in training, but then adopts GNN's architecture in testing. Intriguingly, we observe that PMLPs consistently perform on par with (or even exceed) their GNN counterparts, while being much more efficient in training.\n\nThis finding provides a new perspective for understanding the learning behavior of GNNs, and can be used as an analytic tool for dissecting various GNN-related research problems including expressivity, generalization, over-smoothing and heterophily. As an initial step to analyze PMLP, we show its essential difference to MLP at infinite-width limit lies in the NTK feature map in the post-training stage. Moreover, through extrapolation analysis (i.e., generalization under distribution shifts), we find that though most GNNs and their PMLP counterparts cannot extrapolate non-linear functions for extreme out-of-distribution data, they have greater potential to generalize to testing data near the training data support as natural advantages of the GNN architecture used for inference.",

        "Title: Graph Neural Networks are Inherently Good Generalizers: Insights by Bridging GNNs and MLPs\nReview:\nThis paper offers an intriguing perspective on the generalization capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by comparing them to Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) enhanced with message-passing layers. The authors propose an intermediate model class called Propagational MLPs (PMLPs), which retains the training efficiency of MLPs but adopts the GNN architecture during testing. The results are compelling: PMLPs not only match but often surpass GNNs in node-level prediction tasks, while also being more efficient. This discovery is vital for understanding the intrinsic generalization abilities of GNNs and has profound implications for addressing key research areas like expressivity, generalization, over-smoothing, and heterophily in GNNs. The analysis reveals that the major difference between PMLPs and MLPs, when considering the infinite-width limit, lies in the NTK feature map during the post-training phase. Additionally, the paper suggests that GNNs and PMLPs demonstrate better generalization to testing data that is close to the training data distribution, a natural advantage leveraged by the GNN architecture.\n\nTitle: GNN learning from MLP architectures: Efficiency meets Performance\nReview:\nAligning closely with the insights provided in the paper \"Graph Neural Networks are Inherently Good Generalizers: Insights by Bridging GNNs and MLPs,\" this research presents an innovative model known as Propagational MLPs (PMLPs), which integrates the simplicity and training efficiency of MLPs with the architectural strengths of GNNs for inference. The results indicate that PMLPs not only achieve comparable performance to GNNs in various node-level tasks but often exceed them, marking a significant step forward in model efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. This finding is transformative for the field, as it challenges the conventional belief that GNNs' superiority is primarily due to their expressive power; instead, it highlights intrinsic generalization as a key factor. By dissecting the learning dynamics through the lens of NTK feature maps and extrapolation analysis, the authors provide a thorough understanding of why PMLPs and GNNs generalize well to data distributions similar to the training set. This paper paves the way for more efficient yet effective graph-based models and opens up new avenues for research focusing on generalization properties across different architectures.\n\nTitle: Beyond Expressivity: The Superior Generalization of Graph Neural Networks",

Contrary to the prevalent attribution of GNNs' success to their expressive power, the authors propose that GNNs owe their performance to superior inherent generalization capabilities.\n\n#### Summary and Key Insights\nThe central thesis pivots on a unique theoretical framework involving Propagational-MLP (PMLP), an intermediate model that trains like an MLP but adopts the GNN's message-passing mechanisms during inference. Notably, PMLPs have demonstrated performance on par with or occasionally surpassing traditional GNNs, all while being more training-efficient.\n\n### Key Contributions\n\n1. **Enhanced Generalization**:\n    - Through rigorous analytical methods, the study demonstrates that the generalization power of GNNs significantly contributes to their performance, diverging from the previously held notion focusing on sheer expressivity.\n    - The efficiency of PMLP at the training stage paves the way for potentially faster and computationally cheaper alternatives without sacrificing performance, highlighting the practical value of these insights.\n\n2. **The NTK Feature Map**:\n    - At the infinite-width limit, the critical distinction between MLP and PMLP (hence GNN) lies in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) feature map deployed during the post-training phase.\n    - This finding enriches our understanding of how GNNs process node-level information and could further influence the design of more efficient neural architectures in the future.\n\n3. **Extrapolation Analysis**:\n    - The research scrutinizes how GNNs and PMLPs handle distribution shifts, where most models struggle with non-linear function extrapolation for out-of-distribution data.\n    - Nonetheless, such architectures inherently tend to perform better with testing data closer to the training distribution, illuminating the contextual advantages of GNNs during inference.\n\n### Related Literature\nThis study aligns with and extends several pivotal works on neural network architectures and their capabilities.

Traditionally, GNNs' success has been attributed to their high expressivity\u2014their capacity to capture complex patterns and relationships within graph-structured data. However, this study challenges conventional wisdom by focusing on GNNs' intrinsic generalization capabilities rather than their expressivity.\n\nA key innovation of this research is the introduction of Propagational MLP (PMLP), an intermediate model class that retains MLPs' architecture during training but utilizes the GNN framework for inference. Remarkably, PMLP models not only match but sometimes even surpass the performance of traditional GNNs, while being significantly more efficient to train.\n\nThe findings of this paper are profound as they suggest a new methodology for analyzing GNN-related phenomena such as expressivity, generalization, over-smoothing, and heterophily. Notably, the research highlights that the difference between PMLP and standard MLP becomes evident at the infinite-width limit due to the NTK (Neural Tangent Kernel) feature map during the post-training phase. Furthermore, the paper's exploration of extrapolation analysis points out that although both GNNs and PMLPs struggle with extreme out-of-distribution data, they are well-suited to handle data distributions that are similar to their training sets.\n\nIn essence, this paper offers critical insights into the fundamental nature of GNNs, providing a valuable analytic tool for future research in the field of graph representation learning.

        "**Review 1: Deep Dive into Graph Structural Privacy**\n\nThe paper \"Structural Privacy in Graphs\" addresses a crucial yet often overlooked facet of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) - the structural privacy of graph data. Recognizing that existing privacy-preserving GNN frameworks predominantly focus on node features and labels, the authors bring attention to the imperative need for ensuring the privacy of the graph's structure itself.\n\nThe novel method named SPGraph is introduced to tackle this issue effectively by perturbing the neighborhood data of nodes while preserving essential structural information. The two major challenges identified\u2014first, the reduction in node degree due to randomization, and second, the adverse effects of noise on neighborhood accuracy\u2014are addressed thoughtfully. The introduction of the $\\lambda$-selector to manage neighbor sampling and the use of $p$-hop neighborhoods to mitigate the loss of actual neighbors reflect a well-calibrated approach to preserving structural integrity.\n\nExperiments conducted on real-world datasets provide compelling evidence for the efficacy of SPGraph. This aspect of empirical validation highlights the robustness and practicality of the method, addressing potential concerns regarding the usability and performance of privacy-preserving techniques in GNNs.\n\nIn summary, \"Structural Privacy in Graphs\" makes a significant contribution to the field by extending privacy considerations beyond the traditional scope, thus paving the way for more comprehensive privacy-preserving methods in graph-based machine learning systems.\n\n---\n\n**Review 2: Enhancing GNN Privacy through Structural Perturbation**\n\n\"Structural Privacy in Graphs\" is an excellent exploration of expanding privacy frameworks in GNNs to include structural data. While most research to date has centered around protecting node features and labels, this paper wisely shifts focus to the graph's structure\u2014a critical component that can also harbor sensitive information.\n\nSPGraph, the method proposed by the authors, aims to protect structural privacy by injecting noise into node neighborhoods. This technique is innovative in its dual efforts to compensate for the induced loss in node degree and to denoise the altered neighborhood effectively. The creation of the $\\lambda$-selector ensures the neighbor set doesn't shrink undesirably, and the adoption of $p$-hop neighborhoods helps maintain accuracy despite the noise introduction.\n\nThe authors' rigorous experimentation across multiple real-world datasets provides substantial verification of SPGraph's effectiveness.

The authors deftly highlight the existing gap where current privacy-preserving methods primarily focus on feature and label privacy, neglecting the intricate structure of graph data. This omission could potentially lead to significant privacy vulnerabilities. \n\nThe introduction of SPGraph is particularly noteworthy. The dual challenges of maintaining node degree while adding noise and compensating for the loss of actual neighbors are elegantly tackled through the $\\lambda$-selector and $p$-hop neighborhood methods. These innovations ensure that structural privacy does not come at the cost of significantly degraded performance, which is a recurrent challenge in the domain of privacy preservation.\n\n### Review 2: Enhancing Graph Data Privacy with Structural Noise: A Novel Approach\n\n\"Structural Privacy in Graphs\" presents a strikingly relevant advancement in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning. The authors ingeniously propose SPGraph, a method that adds a layer of structure noise to safeguard the intrinsic connections within graph data. By acknowledging that structural information is equally susceptible to privacy breaches, the authors offer a holistic solution where both node features and graph structure are considered.\n\nThe comprehensive approach using $\\lambda$-selector to maintain node degree and $p$-hop neighborhood to mitigate accuracy loss is well-conceived and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the practical challenges researchers face. The promising results from extensive experiments bolster confidence in the practical viability of SPGraph, making this paper a substantial contribution to the ongoing dialogue on privacy in GNNs.\n\n### Combined Review: Pioneering Complete Privacy in GNNs with SPGraph\n\nThe papers on \"Structural Privacy in Graphs\" collectively underscore a groundbreaking stride towards full-spectrum privacy in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By addressing the crucial aspect of structural privacy, which is often neglected in favor of feature and label privacy, the authors have identified and filled a critical gap.\n\nSPGraph, the proposed methodology, employs structural noise through a $\\lambda$-selector and $p$-hop neighborhood to disrupt the actual neighborhood data of a node without substantial accuracy degradation. This nuanced approach marks a significant improvement over previous methods that either did not consider structure or resulted in unacceptable performance trade-offs.\n\nMoreover, the paper's extensive experimental validation on real-world datasets illustrates SPGraph's potential to serve as a new standard in",

Given that GNNs are widely adopted for modeling complex real-world systems\u2014ranging from social networks to biological processes ensuring privacy within these models is crucial. This study stands out by introducing SPGraph, an innovative method aimed at privatizing the graph structure itself, thereby extending beyond the traditional focus on feature and label privacy.\n\n2. **Methodological Advancements:**\n   The approach taken by the authors to add noise to neighborhood data, combined with $\\lambda$-selector and $p$-hop neighborhood techniques, showcases a novel way to counteract the downsides of node degree reduction and information loss due to randomization. $\\lambda$-selector effectively maintains neighborhood sizes, while $p$-hop extends the coverage to maintain structural integrity, balancing noise introduction and data utility superbly. This enriched the toolset for researchers and practitioners fighting to protect sensitive information in GNN applications.\n\n3. **Experimental Rigor:**\n   The authors' attention to experimental rigor is worth noting. Conducting extensive experiments on real-world datasets adds a significant level of credibility to their claims.

        "### Review: ELPH and BUDDY - Innovations in Link Prediction\n\n**Innovation in GNN-based Link Prediction Methods (ELPH and BUDDY)**\n\nIn recent years, the domain of Link Prediction (LP) has seen notable advancements with the introduction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). A significant challenge, however, has been GNNs' struggle with expressiveness, often falling short compared to simple heuristics. This shortfall mainly arises from their limitations in counting structural patterns like triangles and their inability to distinguish automorphic nodes accurately.\n\nThe paper titled \"Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching\" provides a comprehensive analysis of these limitations and offers novel solutions to overcome them. The key innovations discussed are ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) and BUDDY, two groundbreaking models that push the boundaries of current GNN-based LP methods.\n\n**ELPH: Balancing Expressiveness and Efficiency**\n\nELPH addresses the expressiveness concerns of traditional message-passing GNNs (MPNNs) by augmenting them with subgraph sketches. Unlike existing Subgraph GNNs (SGNNs) that explicitly construct redundant subgraphs, ELPH passes subgraph sketches as messages. This approach approximates the key components of SGNNs without the computational overhead of subgraph construction. \n\nRemarkably, ELPH achieves superior performance on numerous LP benchmarks, demonstrating its enhanced expressiveness over MPNNs. This performance is particularly noteworthy given that ELPH operates orders of magnitude faster than traditional SGNN methods. The underpinning efficiency of ELPH marks a significant step forward for practical applications, especially those requiring real-time predictions.\n\n**BUDDY: A Scalable Approach**\n\nDespite ELPH's exceptional performance, it shares a common limitation with other GNN models: efficiency depends on the dataset fitting within GPU memory. To address this, the paper introduces BUDDY, a model designed for high scalability. BUDDY leverages feature precomputation to sidestep memory constraints without sacrificing predictive accuracy. \n\nThrough extensive experimentation, BUDDY is shown to outperform traditional SGNNs on standard LP benchmarks. It also competes favorably with ELPH, offering a pragmatic solution for large-scale datasets where GPU memory may be a limiting factor. The ability to handle large graphs efficiently positions BUDDY as a highly viable option for extensive real-world applications.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe innovations presented in \"Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching\" represent significant strides in addressing",
        "### Review: Enhancing Link Prediction in Graph Neural Networks\n\nIn the expanding field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a notable contribution is made by the paper titled \"Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching.\" It critically addresses the limitations faced by many GNNs in link prediction (LP) tasks, such as their poor performance compared to simple heuristics mainly due to their inability to count triangles and distinguish automorphic nodes. The authors identify that these expressiveness issues can be mitigated by using link representations and structural features like triangle counts.\n\n**ELPH: A Novel Full-Graph GNN**\nThe paper introduces ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing), a groundbreaking full-graph GNN that leverages subgraph sketches to pass messages, thereby approximating the key functionalities of subgraph GNNs (SGNNs) without the need for explicit and often expensive subgraph constructions. The advancements brought forward by ELPH are twofold: it is more expressive than traditional Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs) and it achieves state-of-the-art performance on various LP benchmarks while maintaining significantly better efficiency.\n\n**BUDDY: Overcoming Data Handling Limitations**\nHowever, ELPH faces an intrinsic limitation common to GNNs, being efficient only when datasets fit within GPU memory. To overcome this, the paper also presents BUDDY, a highly scalable model that employs feature precomputation to circumvent memory constraints without degrading predictive performance. BUDDY stands out for its impressive scalability and speed, still outperforming existing SGNNs on standard LP benchmarks.\n\n### Integrative Review: ELPH and BUDDY Revolutionizing Graph-Based Predictions\n\nThe collective insights from the ELPH and BUDDY models presented in \"Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching\" underscore a pivotal evolution in the realm of graph-based predictions. ELPH innovatively addresses the challenges of expressiveness and computational efficiency by introducing subgraph sketches in place of explicit subgraph constructions. This not only enhances the model's ability to glean and encode structural nuances essential for accurate link prediction but also ushers in a dramatic improvement in processing speed.\n\nBUDDY, on the other hand, takes this a step further by tackling the data handling constraints that often plague GPU-dependent models. Its clever use of feature precomputation provides a much-needed scalable solution which ensures that the robustness and predictive power of advanced GNNs are not confined by hardware limitations.

The first paper underscores the limitations of traditional GNNs in performing LP tasks and introduces the concept of using subgraph sketches to improve efficiency. The second paper introduces ELPH, a novel full-graph GNN designed to address these limitations by passing subgraph sketches as messages, achieving both higher expressiveness and improved performance over traditional GNNs.\n\n#### Review:\nIn recent years, the use of graph neural networks for link prediction has faced significant scrutiny, primarily due to their inability to handle certain expressiveness challenges, such as counting triangles and distinguishing automorphic nodes. The paper \"Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching\" brings a fresh perspective by utilizing subgraph-based approaches to bolster LP performance. This methodology offers a promising direction but is hampered by inefficiencies due to redundancies in subgraph constructions.\n\nBuilding upon these insights, the second paper, \"Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing (ELPH),\" presents a more refined solution. By avoiding explicit subgraph construction and instead utilizing subgraph sketches passed as messages, ELPH demonstrates its capacity to maintain key components of subgraph GNNs. As a result, ELPH not only outpaces existing SGNN models on standard LP benchmarks but also operates at an impressive speed\u2014albeit with the caveat that it necessitates fitting the dataset into GPU memory.\n\nConclusively, both papers highlight significant strides in overcoming the traditional pitfalls of GNNs in link prediction tasks.

However, its application in Graph Convolutional Networks (GNNs) has been somewhat limited. This is where **GCINT** makes a significant entry. By addressing the primary challenges outlined in the abstract - quantifying distinctions between data sources, streams, and concentrations, as well as QAT's limitations - the authors have managed to propose a robust quantization framework optimized for GNN training.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of GCINT is its efficiency. The entire training process, from forward and backward propagation to optimization and loss calculation, is done using integer data. This methodological shift results in a remarkable training acceleration ratio of nearly 10\u00d7 compared to traditional FP32 Cuda Core computations on an RTX 2080TI's INT8 Tensor Core.\n\nThe robustness and universality of GCINT are further evidenced by the extensive trials the authors have conducted. With over 2,000 randomized experiments across 8 prominent GNN benchmark datasets, the quantization framework consistently maintained errors within 1% of FP32 calculations. This level of accuracy, coupled with the efficiency gains, makes GCINT a highly competitive option in the GNN landscape. \n\nIn summary, GCINT not only addresses the limitations of existing quantization methods for GNNs but also provides a tangible improvement in training speeds without sacrificing model performance. It's an innovative step forward that could enable more widespread adoption of efficient GNN models in real-world applications.\n\n# Combined Review for \"GCINT\" with Emphasis on Quantization Challenges\n\nWhen it comes to reducing computational complexity and storage demands in neural networks, quantization has shown considerable promise. However, its application within Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GNNs) has been rather limited due to several inherent challenges. The paper titled **\"GCINT: Dynamic Quantization Algorithm for Training Graph Convolution Neural Networks Using Only Integers\"** brilliantly tackles these barriers, offering a compelling solution.\n\nQuantization in the realm of GNNs is fraught with difficulties such as quantifying distinctions between data sources, streams, and concentrations. Additionally, existing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods haven't been sufficiently optimized for GNN frameworks. GCINT makes significant strides in this area by introducing an integer-only quantization framework that greatly mitigates these problems.\n\nOne of the standout features of GCINT is its remarkable efficiency.
