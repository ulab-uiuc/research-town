Let's delve into reviews based on the input you provided and the external data, focusing on two related titles for a comprehensive analysis. \n\n### Review 1: A Critical Look at Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n---\n\nThis paper, *Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning*, makes a significant contribution to the domain of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). It directly tackles lexicographic multi-objective problems, which prioritize objectives in a predefined order of importance, an aspect frequently observed in real-world scenarios. The authors rightly note the scarcity of existing RL work in this niche and highlight the heuristic nature of previously proposed solutions that lack theoretical grounding due to the inapplicability of the Bellman equation.\n\nThe authors' engagement with the practical applicability issues previously noted in the literature is laudable. They go a step further by investigating other shortcomings that have not been given due attention and proposing fixes that improve practical performance. The introduction of the Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm is particularly noteworthy. This novel policy optimization approach holds promise in addressing both theoretical and practical concerns that have beleaguered the field.\n\nDemonstrations on benchmark problems are a strong feature of this work as they offer empirical validation of the proposed methods. However, while the experimental results are compelling, a detailed comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art could offer deeper insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods. Overall, this paper is a substantial step forward in the development of more effective MORL strategies for lexicographic tasks.\n\n### Review 2: Enhancements in Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning: Addressing Theoretical and Practical Challenges\n---\n\n*Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning* brings forward an insightful discourse on the application of lexicographic principles in multi-objective reinforcement learning. The paper effectively articulates the challenges in applying the Bellman equation to lexicographic multi-objective problems, an area often glossed over in existing literature.\n\nThe authors' approach, which digs deeper into previously known issues while uncovering new challenges, is both thorough and innovative. Their solutions, especially the proposed Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm, are crucial additions to the toolkit for addressing these challenges. The LPO algorithm\u2019s mechanism for policy optimization is particularly impressive because it not only offers theoretical robustness but also advances the practical performance of MORL algorithms.\n\nThe authors document the efficacy of their methods through robust benchmark problem demonstrations, attesting to",
        "Sure, here are some reviews based on the input data provided:\n\n### Review 1: \n\n**Title: Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning**\n\nThe paper \"Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\" addresses a pivotal yet underexplored domain within reinforcement learning\u2014lexicographic multi-objective problems. Such problems, which impose a hierarchical importance order over objectives, are paramount in many real-world scenarios ranging from resource allocation to automated decision-making systems. The existing literature has been primarily heuristic-focused, often lacking theoretical foundations, which prevents the reliable application of the Bellman equation.\n\nThis paper distinguishes itself by meticulously examining both the theoretical and practical limitations of existing heuristic approaches. The authors address notable issues like the inability of prior methods to reach goal states, and more generally, the algorithmic inefficacy in certain conditions. By diving deeper into these shortcomings, they do not merely identify the gaps but also propose robust fixes aimed at enhancing practical performance. \n\nTheir proposed framework, Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO), brings a fresh perspective to policy optimization under lexicographic constraints. What stands out is the dual emphasis on theoretical soundness and empirical evidence, both of which are demonstrated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems. This work paves the way for future research to build on a more solid foundation, and practitioners could potentially harness these advancements for real-world applications where multiple objectives need to be prioritized lexicographically.\n\n### Review 2:\n\n**Title: Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning: A New Approach with Thresholded Policies and Lexicographic Projection Optimization**\n\nThe paper under review makes significant strides in the niche but impactful area of Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (LMORL). Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques often fall short when applied to lexicographically ordered objectives due to the inherent complexity and hierarchical nature of these problems. Prior work has somewhat addressed these challenges but largely through heuristic means, which lack the theoretical rigor needed for robust application.\n\nThis research highlights these gaps, beginning with a comprehensive critique of existing methodologies. The authors do an excellent job of pointing out critical issues such as the failure to reach goal states and various inefficiencies that plague these heuristic models. By addressing these nuanced shortcomings, the paper sets a solid foundation for introducing a more reliable approach.\n\nAt the heart of their contribution is the Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm, which integrates thresholded policies for a more precise handling of lexicographic order. This method stands out due to its potential to",
        "### Review 1: Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning \u2013 Addressing Real-life Scenarios with Theoretically Sound Approaches\n\nOne of the latest advances in the area of multi-objective reinforcement learning is presented in the paper \"Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning.\" This work addresses the complicated yet crucial issue of lexicographic multi-objective problems by providing a fresh perspective on how these problems can be approached more effectively. \n\nLexicographic multi-objective problems are common in real-world scenarios, where certain objectives are strictly more important than others. Prior research in this domain was mainly heuristic without theoretical guarantees, as the Bellman equation did not apply to these lexicographic tasks. Existing methods also faced significant practical issues, such as failure to achieve the goal state.\n\nThis paper provides a dual contribution. First, it investigates and highlights the shortcomings of current heuristic approaches, shedding light on why they struggle with theoretical and practical challenges. Second, it introduces a new algorithm called Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO), designed to address both the theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility concerns better. Through a series of benchmark problems, the authors demonstrate how LPO can outperform existing methods, achieving more reliable and efficient outcomes.\n\n### Review 2: LPO Algorithm - Bridging the Theory-Practice Divide in Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe paper \"Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\" makes a significant stride in the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) community by proposing the Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm.\n\nLexicographic ordering of objectives is crucial in numerous applications, where priorities need to be strictly adhered to. Historically, reinforcement learning approaches to such problems have faced numerous hurdles. Previous methods lacked a theoretical backbone due to the non-applicability of the Bellman equation and encountered practical issues, such as not reaching the goal state.\n\nThe authors address these challenges head-on by first dissecting the limitations of existing heuristic methods. Their critical analysis paves the way for their novel LPO algorithm, a policy optimization approach designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The LPO algorithm provides a structured method to handle lexicographic ordering, thus ensuring the theoretical guarantees which previous methods lacked. Furthermore, it improves practical performance significantly, as demonstrated by various benchmark problems included in the study.\n\nThis paper is an essential read for anyone involved in MORL, offering both a clear expos\u00e9 of current methodologies' weaknesses and a promising new direction to address"

Traditionally dominated by methods adopting Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks, AutoFE has long been hindered by challenges such as inefficiency, lack of generalization, and high computational costs. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach in the form of FETCH (Feature Set Data-Driven Search), which rethinks the AutoFE paradigm using a more intuitive, data-driven Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n\nOne of the key strengths of FETCH lies in its setup: the use of tabular data as the state fed into a well-designed policy network. This adjustment aligns more closely with the procedures employed by human experts, enabling a model that is not only more efficient but also more capable of extending its learned knowledge to new, unseen datasets. The concept of transferability, a long-sought goal in this domain, is effectively addressed and substantiated through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that FETCH not only outperforms current state-of-the-art AutoFE methods but also maintains its effectiveness when applied to entirely new datasets without needing complex re-engineering or additional data exploration.\n\nThe contribution is pioneering, especially the pre-training and transferability aspects of AutoFE, which herald a significant leap in the efficiency and applicability of automated feature engineering. \n\n### Comparative Review with Related Titles\n\n#### Comparative Review with: \"AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art\"\n\nWhile \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\" focuses on a specific aspect of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) \u2014 the feature engineering process \u2014 it significantly complements and extends the discussions typically found in a broad survey like \"AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art.\u201d \n\nThe survey paper generally outlines the various methodologies, challenges, and progress in the AutoML field. The FETCH framework presents a solid case study of applying innovative techniques to one of the critical components in AutoML, providing a detailed examination of how leveraging a data-driven MDP setup benefits feature engineering. The articulate exposition of the inefficiencies in NAS-based solutions adds valuable criticism and motivation for new directions in the AutoML research landscape, as precisely illustrated by the phenomena observed with FETCH.\n\nCombining insights from these two titles would provide readers a comprehensive understanding of both the landscape and cutting-edge advancements in the domain of automated feature engineering, making it easier to appreciate",

        "### Review of \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\"\n\nThe paper \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\" addresses a crucial bottleneck in the realm of tabular data analysis: feature engineering. Traditionally a manual and highly domain-specific process, feature engineering has seen significant improvements with the emergence of automated methods (AutoFE). Most prior approaches have relied on frameworks adapted from neural architecture search (NAS) methods, which though effective, are resource-intensive and not optimally aligned with how human experts approach the data.\n\n#### Novelty and Methodology:\n\nThe core of the paper\u2019s innovation lies in proposing a novel AutoFE framework named **Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH)**. FETCH diverges from NAS-based methods by incorporating a new Markov decision process (MDP) setup which integrates tabular datasets as inputs to the policy network. This data-driven MDP setup allows for the feature engineering process to be more consistent with the domain-specific nuances examined by human data scientists.\n\nOne of the standout propositions is the enhanced transferability of the policy network developed in FETCH. By training on diverse datasets, FETCH's policy network can generalize to unseen datasets effectively without requiring additional computationally expensive exploration. This highlights a significant advancement in AutoFE, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable solutions in data science workflows.\n\n#### Empirical Validation:\n\nThe paper is backed by extensive experiments that benchmark FETCH against existing state-of-the-art AutoFE methods. The results systematically demonstrate FETCH's superiority in terms of performance and computational efficiency. This empirical validation strengthens the credibility of FETCH and asserts its potential to be a game-changer in automated feature engineering.\n\n#### Related Work:\n\nThe work resonates closely with advancements in neural architecture search and automated machine learning (AutoML). One paper that aligns well with the underpinnings of this research is \"Automated Machine Learning for Table Data Analysis\", which investigates similar thematic concerns in automating aspects of data science, albeit with a focus on the end-to-end pipeline rather than specialized components such as feature engineering. As the AutoML landscape evolves, integrating robust and transfer learning-friendly AutoFE frameworks like FETCH could significantly streamline and automate tabular data modeling, fostering a more efficient workflow in data-intensive domains.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOverall, \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\" carves a promising path forward in the automated feature engineering landscape. By reframing the MDP setup to reflect how human experts interact with data, FETCH not only achieves state-of-the-art"

Traditional RL algorithms typically require extensive data and computational resources; however, this study leverages the concept of \"dreaming\" to construct an innovative two-module neural network model. The model mimics the human and animal capacity to learn from minimal practice, employing an artificial simulation to generate new experiences during the dreaming phase.\n\nA standout aspect of this research is its focus on reducing the reliance on detailed storage of past experiences, a constraint that challenges the biological plausibility of conventional RL approaches. The authors propose alternating between dreaming and planning, with both mechanisms demonstrating significant improvements in learning efficiency. Their findings not only enhance our understanding of how artificial agents might emulate biological learning processes but also suggest practical implementations in neuromorphic hardware, emphasizing real-time online learning rather than extensive offline training.\n\nOverall, this paper makes a compelling case for integrating biological principles into artificial learning systems, offering viable pathways to expedite skill acquisition and practical application without the hefty data requirements that characterize current methodologies.\n\n**Review 2:**\n\n**Title: Blending Biological Inspirations with Reinforcement Learning: Analysis of 'Towards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning'**\n\n\"Towards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning\" investigates innovative methodologies for reinforcement learning by proposing a biologically inspired two-module neural network.

The potential applications in neuromorphic hardware, where real-time learning and minimal storage are critical, highlight the relevance and future applicability of these approaches.\n\nThis paper makes a valuable contribution to the pursuit of biologically plausible AI, presenting solutions that could reshape how artificial agents learn and interact with their environments, bridging the gap between biological learning processes",
        "### Review 1: Integrating Biological Plausibility into Reinforcement Learning Algorithms\n\nThe convergence of artificial intelligence and neuroscience is producing intriguing research that aims to make machine learning algorithms more aligned with biological processes. The paper titled *\"Towards biologically plausible Dreaming and Planning\"* addresses a fundamental gap in current reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms by proposing a biologically plausible approach to learning through \u201cdreaming\u201d and \u201cplanning.\u201d\n\nHumans and animals exhibit the extraordinary capability to learn new tasks with minimal experience, whereas current RL algorithms require a substantial amount of data to achieve similar outcomes. This discrepancy largely stems from the biological implausibility and inefficiency of traditional RL methods, such as the necessity for detailed storage of past experiences and extensive offline learning. The authors tackle this issue by introducing a two-module neural network designed to mimic the process of dreaming. Essentially, this involves creating new experiences within a model-based simulated environment, which significantly accelerates the learning process.\n\nWhat makes this approach particularly compelling is its alignment with how biological organisms operate. The model proposed circumvents the need for detailed experience storage and online world-model learning\u2014key attributes that enhance both the biological plausibility and the feasibility of implementation in neuromorphic hardware. Additionally, the authors provide an alternative method of \u201cplanning,\u201d which demonstrates comparable performances to dreaming, thus offering flexibility in application.\n\nThe research underscores an exciting shift towards more efficient learning algorithms inspired by nature. This work holds promise for developing RL systems that are not only more data-efficient but also capable of more sophisticated, human-like learning and decision-making processes.\n\n### Review 2: Revolutionizing Model-Based Learning through Dreaming and Planning\n\nIn the quest to bridge the efficiency gap between biological learning and artificial intelligence, the paper *\"Towards biologically plausible Dreaming and Planning\"* presents a groundbreaking approach. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are limited by their dependency on vast amounts of interaction data with the environment. This paper, however, explores methodologies inspired by biological processes to significantly enhance learning efficiency.\n\nThe authors propose a novel two-module neural network that utilizes \u201cdreaming\u201d as a core component. Here, dreaming is conceptualized as allowing the agent to experience new scenarios within a simulated environment created by an internal model. This imaginative process aims to mimic the way humans and animals process and learn from experiences in a more data-efficient manner. By generating artificial experiences, the model reduces the need for detailed memory storage and extended offline learning phases, which are typically constraints in current RL systems.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of \"planning\" as an online alternative to dreaming showcases",

The key innovation is the integration of a \"dreaming\" mechanism within a neural network, which simulates new experiences in a model-based environment to expedite learning. This approach counters the traditional reinforcement learning models that require enormously detailed storage of past experiences and extensive periods of offline learning\u2014traits that are biologically implausible.\n\nThe authors' two-module neural network (agent and model) showcases significant improvements in learning efficiency by mimicking the biological process of dreaming. This simulated environment allows for accelerated skill acquisition without the need for prolonged data interaction. Interestingly, an alternative method termed \"planning,\" which functions online, showed comparable performances in boosting learning efficiency.

Unlike traditional methods that depend on extensive offline learning and detailed past experiences, the authors offer a unique perspective by drawing inspiration from nature's own learning mechanisms.\n\nThe proposed two-module neural network incorporates a \"dreaming\" mechanism that effectively simulates new experiences, thus expediting the learning process significantly. What sets this approach apart is its departure from the necessity to store detailed experiences, a limitation in classical models that impedes biological plausibility. Alongside dreaming, the authors introduce \"planning,\" a comparable online technique that also enhances learning efficiency without extensive data storage.\n\nBoth methods\u2014dreaming and planning\u2014significantly contribute to the ongoing discourse about the optimal ways to learn and exploit world-models.

      "abstract": "Recently, graph-based planning algorithms have gained much attention to solve goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: they provide a sequence of subgoals to reach the target-goal, and the agents learn to execute subgoal-conditioned policies. However, the sample-efficiency of such RL schemes still remains a challenge, particularly for long-horizon tasks.  To address this issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance. Unlike prior methods that only utilize graph-based planning in an execution phase, our method transfers knowledge from a planner along with a graph into policy learning. We empirically show that our method can significantly boost the sample-efficiency of the existing goal-conditioned RL methods under various long-horizon control tasks.",

This stochastic skipping technique provides flexibility in execution, which significantly curtails the rigidity seen in traditional graph-based planning methods. Consequently, this improvement not only bolsters performance but also injects diversity, thereby enhancing the robustness of the RL agent's performance across various long-horizon control tasks.\n\n**Experimental Evaluation:**\n\nThe empirical results presented in the paper are robust and extensive, covering a wide range of long-horizon RL tasks.

Here are two potential combinations with reviews:\n\n### Review of \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies\" and \"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning: A Comparison of Methods and Significance\"\nThe paper \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies\" addresses a key limitation in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), notably, the sample efficiency in long-horizon tasks. The authors propose a novel self-imitation method that aligns subgoal-conditioned policies with target-goal-conditioned policies. The concept hinges on the observation that traversing from subgoal to subgoal is essential to reach the final target goal. By distilling subgoal policies into target-goal policies, the approach enhances the sample efficiency of existing GCRL methods. Furthermore, the stochastic skipping of executed subgoals is a compelling addition that showcases improvements in performance. \n\nIn comparison, \"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning: A Comparison of Methods and Significance\" offers a broad overview of various hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) strategies, discussing both theoretical frameworks and practical implementations. The juxtaposition of these two works highlights a convergence in objectives: simplifying complex tasks by breaking them into manageable segments. Both approaches leverage hierarchical structures to tackle long-horizon challenges effectively. \n\nWhile the HRL paper provides a deep dive into different hierarchical methodologies and benchmarks their significance, the \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning\" paper narrows the focus to a novel refinement within the graph-based planning paradigm. It's evident that the self-imitation and subgoal-stochastic skipping methods can be seen as layers within a hierarchical framework\u2014offering a specialized, learned policy that dovetails nicely with wider HRL strategies. Thus, these works collectively offer a robust toolkit for advancing GCRL by focusing on strengthening both top-down planning and bottom-up learning efficiencies.\n\n### Review of \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies\" and \"Graph Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey\"\nThe \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies\" paper makes notable strides in the reinforcement learning community by addressing efficiency issues in goal-conditioned tasks.

        "### Title: Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories, and Evaluating RL Generalization with Relay Evaluation: A Comprehensive Review\n\n### Abstract\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agents have demonstrated remarkable prowess in mastering tasks within controlled environments. However, their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) trajectories remains a critical challenge. In \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories,\" the authors introduce a novel evaluation scheme called relay evaluation to scrutinize this generalization capability. The study illustrates significant failures in generalization, even among high-performing agents, and proposes an innovative solution called Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA) to mitigate these failures. This review will explore the methods, findings, and implications of this research, emphasizing relay evaluation's role in advancing RL generalization.\n\n### Key Findings and Methodologies\nThe paper highlights a critical gap in RL: an agent's inability to generalize across OOD trajectories. The authors propose relay evaluation as a means to rigorously test this capability. Here are the key components of their methodology and findings:\n\n1. **Relay Evaluation:** The testing framework involves starting a test agent from the middle of trajectories generated by other well-trained, independent agents. This scenario simulates real-world unpredictability where an agent must adapt to new states not encountered during its training. The framework exposed an alarming failure rate in agents, as illustrated by a PPO agent in a Humanoid environment that transitioned from a 3.9% failure rate to 81.6% under OOD conditions.\n\n2. **Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA):** To tackle the relay generalized failures, STA was proposed. This method resets the environment to previous states that the RL agent has encountered, guided by the Q function during training. The incorporation of STA into the training regime of the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm resulted in a significant reduction in failure rates during relay evaluation\u2014improving reliability over 300% in most experimental setups without adding extra training overhead.\n\n### Implications for Future Research\nThe novel relay evaluation framework and STA method introduced by the authors contribute valuable tools for future RL research and applications. Here are key implications and areas for further exploration:\n\n1. **Benchmarking Generalization:** Relay evaluation provides a robust benchmark for assessing an RL agent's generalization ability. Future research could standardize this evaluation across various environments and tasks to create a comprehensive dataset for comparing RL algorithms",
        "### 1. Title: Improving Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: A Study on Relay Generalization and Self-Trajectory Augmentation\n\n**Review:**\nThis paper addresses a critical and often overlooked issue in reinforcement learning (RL): the ability of agents to generalize across unseen states, which is referred to as \"relay generalization.\" The authors introduce an innovative evaluation method called relay evaluation to test RL agents' generalization capabilities more rigorously. They note that RL agents, while proficient in controlled environments, often fail to perform well when tested on trajectories created by other independently well-trained agents. This starkly highlights the prevalence of generalization failure even among well-trained agents.\n\nFor instance, in the Humanoid environment, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that had a failure rate as low as 3.9% during standard testing failed a staggering 81.6% of the time in the relay evaluation. This indicates the limited capacity of conventional RL methods to handle varied and out-of-distribution states, which is a significant drawback for applications requiring robust generalization.\n\nThe proposed method, Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA), demonstrates the potential to bridge this generalization gap effectively. By resetting the training environment to the agent's previous states informed by the Q function, STA facilitates a broader exposure to diverse state spaces during training. As a result, an agent trained using the STA technique, particularly the Soft Actor Critic (SAC), exhibited a dramatic reduction in failure rates during relay evaluation \u2013 more than threefold in many cases \u2013 without compromising overall performance or increasing environment interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by focusing on a practical and pervasive challenge. The introduction of relay evaluation provides a more stringent test for generalization performance, while STA offers a promising solution to enhance the robustness of RL agents.\n\n### 2. Title: Can Agents Excel with Strangers? Evaluating and Enhancing Generalization in RL using Relay Races and STA\n\n**Review:**\nThe research presented in this paper explores a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) \u2013 the ability of agents to generalize across out-of-distribution states. The authors propose a novel evaluation method called relay evaluation to assess this aspect. In this setup, an agent starts from states within the trajectories of other well-trained agents, effectively pushing the agent's ability to adapt to novel conditions.\n\nThe findings reveal a concerning issue: well-trained agents, such as those using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, significantly under",
        "### Review: Agents' Generalization Performance in Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe paper \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" addresses an important yet often overlooked aspect of reinforcement learning (RL)\u2014the generalization of agents to unfamiliar states. The authors propose a novel relay evaluation metric to test how well an RL agent can adapt to the trajectories generated by independently trained agents. This approach serves as a more rigorous test of generalization compared to standard evaluations that often rely on a limited set of trajectories the agent is already familiar with. The findings are alarming but insightful: well-performing agents, such as those based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), show a substantial drop in performance when tasked with unknown trajectories, signaling a broader issue in RL generalization capabilities.\n\nOne of the key strengths of this paper is its methodological innovation, particularly the proposed Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA) technique. By resetting the environment to old states according to the Q function during training, the authors were able to significantly enhance the generalization capabilities of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) agents. Notably, STA led to a dramatic reduction in failure rates without compromising other performance metrics or necessitating additional environment interactions. This makes STA a highly practical method for RL training.\n\nThe paper's extensive experimental evaluation across various environments, especially the detailed analysis in the Humanoid environment, adds robustness to the conclusions drawn. The startling revelation that a typically high-performing PPO agent could fail in over 81.6% of out-of-distribution states generated by stranger agents underscores the broader applicability and necessity of the proposed relay evaluation.\n\n### Review: Towards Robust RL Generalization with STA\n\n\"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" is a compelling contribution to the RL community, presenting both a novel evaluation framework and an innovative training method to address generalization issues. The primary thrust of the paper is the introduction of the relay evaluation, designed to challenge RL agents with out-of-distribution trajectories generated by independently trained agents. This method departs from the conventional in-distribution training paradigm and pushes the boundaries of RL generalization testing.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting aspect is the Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA) method. By recycling past states in training based on the Q function, STA effectively enhances the agent's exposure to a broader state space without demanding extra interactions with the environment. The results are promising: applying STA to the SAC training process yielded a significant decrease in"

Classical model-free RL algorithms like Q-learning can be made stable, and has the potential to solve complicated tasks individually.

On the other hand, model-based RL algorithms, naturally transfers to various reward functions if the transition dynamics are learned well. Unfortunately, model-learning usually suffers from high dimensional observations and/or long horizons due to the challenges of compounding error.

However, conventional self-supervised methods often focus on preserving global visual features, potentially overlooking specific changes significant for task execution. The groundbreaking paper \"Temporal Change Sensitive Representation for Reinforcement Learning\" addresses this critical shortfall by introducing the Temporal Change Sensitive Representation (TCSR) technique.\n\nThe core innovation in TCSR lies in its ability to enhance the reinforcement learning (RL) agent's latent state representation, directing focus toward observation aspects likely to experience future changes. This anticipatory adjustment ensures the agent prioritizes task-relevant information, thereby refining decision-making. Leveraging latent dynamic models, TCSR facilitates more sensitive and adaptive learning, crucial in dynamically changing environments typically encountered in RL tasks.\n\nCritical validation of TCSR's effectiveness is provided through its application to the Atari100K benchmarks, where it demonstrates State-of-the-Art (SoTA) performance. This empirical success underscores the method's potential to set new benchmarks in DRL.\n\nA related paper, **Deep Contextual Learning with Self-Supervised Temporal Dynamics**, explores a similar thematic territory by deploying self-supervised learning to grasp temporal dynamics in reinforcement frameworks. However, unlike TCSR's precise focus on future changes, this approach emphasizes broader contextual understanding through temporal dynamics. When combined, insights from these two works offer a comprehensive toolkit for enhancing temporal sensitivity in RL, marking a significant step towards more intelligent and adaptable reinforcement agents.\n\n### Paper Review: Advancements in Latent Dynamic Models for Reinforcement Learning\n\nTwo influential papers cement recent advancements in the use of latent dynamic models within reinforcement learning: **Temporal Change Sensitive Representation for Reinforcement Learning** and **Comparative Analysis of Latent Space Models in RL**.\n\n\"Temporal Change Sensitive Representation for Reinforcement Learning\" introduces a novel method dubbed Temporal Change Sensitive Representation (TCSR), purpose-built for latent dynamic models in RL. Unlike traditional methods concentrating on global visual information retention, TCSR meticulously amplifies focus on variations in visual data that hold future significance for task execution. This directed emphasis ensures that the agent's latent state representations are dynamically adaptable, a feature that has translated into SoTA performances on the complex Atari100K benchmarks.\n\nComplementing this work is **Comparative Analysis of Latent Space Models in RL**, a paper that provides an extensive evaluation of existing latent space models to identify which are most effective under",

This nuanced focus allows for a more precise and task-relevant preservation of observational data, which is pivotal in dynamic environments where change detection is crucial. \n\nThe empirical results substantiate the theoretical claims, and it's compelling to see such practical validation. The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other representation learning techniques to fully demonstrate TCSR's relative advantages. Additionally, exploring the scalability of this method across a broader range of tasks and benchmarks would be an interesting avenue for future research.\n\n### Paper 2 and 3: Temporal Difference Learning with Self-Supervised Representations\n\n#### Review:\nCombining \"Temporal Change Sensitive Representation for Reinforcement Learning\" with \"Temporal Difference Learning with Self-Supervised Representations\" offers a comprehensive view of the advancements and challenges in enhancing reinforcement learning through representation learning.\n\nThe synergy between these papers lies in their mutual focus on leveraging temporal dynamics to improve learning efficiency.

        "Title: Temporal Change Sensitive Representation for Reinforcement Learning  \nTitle: Action Recognition with Temporal Shift Module\n\nReview:\nThe paper titled \"Temporal Change Sensitive Representation for Reinforcement Learning\" introduces an innovative approach to address a critical gap in image-based deep reinforcement learning. The authors propose Temporal Change Sensitive Representation (TCSR), which is specifically designed to enhance the preservation of task-relevant information in the agent\u2019s latent state representation. Unlike previous self-supervised representation learning algorithms that primarily focus on capturing global visual information, TCSR highlights changes in visual data that could be pivotal for future decision-making. This methodological shift is a significant advancement as it recognizes that not all visual information holds equal importance for task performance\u2014a nuance that previous approaches have overlooked.\n\nIn a related context, the paper \"Action Recognition with Temporal Shift Module\" delves into temporal dynamics from an action recognition perspective. The Temporal Shift Module (TSM) effectively captures temporal dependencies by shifting information across temporal dimensions, enabling better action recognition in video sequences. Both TCSR and TSM underscore the significance of temporal information\u2014albeit in different application domains\u2014indicating a broader trend towards leveraging temporal changes for more accurate model predictions.\n\nThe integration of TCSR in reinforcement learning algorithms like those tested on the Atari100K benchmark showcases impressive State-of-the-Art (SoTA) performance. This result underscores the utility of preserving and emphasizing dynamic parts of the observation space, affirming the potential of TCSR in applications where temporal changes are crucial.

The authors introduce an advanced hybrid architecture, merging the actor-critic model's parameter-based value functions with the policy embedding strategy derived from Policy Evaluation Networks. This unique combination allows the method to evaluate multiple policies through a single value function, which is a notable departure from traditional RL algorithms that learn value functions tailored to single policies.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of this work is its ability to handle continuous control problems with an infinite number of states by identifying a minimal set of 'probing states'. The method not only reduces the complexity of policy evaluation but also encapsulates essential knowledge about the environment into a small number of states. The empirical results showcased in continuous control environments such as Swimmer-v3 and Hopper-v3 are impressive. The ability to replicate near-optimal policies by updating actions in just a few crucial states signifies a substantial advancement in RL policy optimization.\n\nMoreover, the zero-shot learning capability, where the value function trained on neural network (NN) policies can successfully evaluate and improve linear policies, adds a layer of robustness and applicability to diverse policy architectures. This robustness underscores the method's potential for wide-ranging applications in various RL settings. Overall, this paper offers a significant contribution to the field of RL by demonstrating a method that not only improves policy evaluation efficiency but also broadens the scope of its application across different policy structures.\n\n**Review 2: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Representations of Critical States**\n\nThe paper \"General Policy Evaluation and Improvement by Learning to Identify Few But Crucial States\" makes a significant contribution to the reinforcement learning (RL) literature by presenting an approach that simplifies and enhances policy evaluation and improvement.

Traditional RL algorithms have been efficient for evaluating a single policy; however, the need for more versatile methods has driven researchers to pursue the development of value functions applicable to multiple policies. This paper leverages the actor-critic architecture of Parameter-Based Value Functions combined with Policy Evaluation Networks to construct a value function that can evaluate any policy represented by a deep neural network (NN).\n\n### Technical Innovations and Continuous Control\n\nThe most striking innovation presented is the identification of a small set of 'probing states' which sufficiently captures the behavior of many policies in continuous control environments rife with infinitely many states. This method addresses the complexity of policy evaluation by distilling the environment's state space into a handful of critical 'probing states' that encapsulate enough information to guide the entire policy. This capability is demonstrated through experiments on Swimmer-v3 and Hopper-v3 environments, where the researchers successfully cloned near-optimal policies by learning to act in only 3-5 critical states. This not only showcases the method\u2019s efficiency but also its potential application in real-world continuous control problems where state spaces are often vast and complex.\n\n### Zero-Shot Learning and Policy Architecture Invariance\n\nAnother notable aspect of this research is the novel finding that the proposed value function retains its efficacy across different policy architectures. The paper reports on zero-shot learning of linear policies that are competitive with the best NN policies seen during training. This indicates an impressive level of generalization and robustness in the proposed method, suggesting that it could serve as a foundation for cross-architectural policy evaluations in future applications.\n\n### Practical Implications and Future Directions\n\nThe ability to improve an RL policy by simply altering actions in a few learned states has significant practical implications. For instance, it could simplify the training process in environments where data acquisition is expensive or time-consuming. Additionally, the performance in complex environments underscores the potential to transfer these techniques from academic research to industry applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and adaptive control systems.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper is a commendable stride towards more efficient and generalizable RL methods.

DeFog stands out by offering a solution that circumvents the need for continuous online interaction, thereby enhancing the safety and efficiency of RL applications.\n\n**Core Innovations and Methodology**:\n\n1. **Offline Dataset Masking**:\n   DeFog innovatively masks offline datasets, simulating the effect of dropped frames during training. This preemptive strategy ensures that the model inherently learns to handle missing information, mirroring real-world sensor or communication losses. \n\n2. **Explicit Time Span Integration**:\n   The explicit addition of the time span of frame dropping as an input feature helps the model to better understand temporal dependencies and adapt its decision-making process accordingly. This ensures that the agent's actions remain coherent and effective, even with significant information gaps.\n\n3. **Finetuning with Higher Mask Rates**:\n   Following the initial training phase, DeFog undergoes a finetuning stage with an increased mask rate, bolstering its robustness in environments with extreme data loss. This two-phase training mechanism is pivotal in achieving superior performance under severe frame drop scenarios.\n\n**Empirical Validation**:\n\nDeFog consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL algorithms under challenging conditions, such as drop rates as high as 90%. Moreover, it maintains comparable performance under standard, non-dropping conditions across regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and Atari environments. This dual capability underscores DeFog's adaptability and robustness, making it a compelling choice for practical deployments.\n\n**Comparative Context**:\n\nWhen juxtaposed with other recent works in robust RL, such as [Insert Other Paper\u2019s Title on Robust RL], which also aim to mitigate the impact of unreliable data, DeFog stands out due to its offline learning approach. While methods in the latter primarily focus on enhancing online"

Traditional models rely on predefined explicit transformations of inputs and outputs to enforce symmetry. However, the authors make a compelling case for the potential of neural networks to discover and adapt to symmetries inherently present in the data. This is particularly valuable in real-world applications where explicit symmetries are not easily discernible.\n\nA striking revelation from the paper is the differentiation between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints. While imposing incorrect or mismatched symmetry constraints can be detrimental, extrinsic symmetry constraints\u2014those that do not precisely align with the domain symmetry\u2014can surprisingly enhance performance. This counterintuitive insight opens new avenues for neural network architecture design, particularly in fields requiring high sample efficiency and robust generalization, such as robotics and control systems.

By shifting the focus to discovering these symmetries within the environment, the authors present a novel approach that leverages equivariant models to improve both supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\n\nOne of the paper's most notable contributions is its assertion that not all symmetry constraints are harmful when they don't align perfectly with domain symmetries. Instead, introducing extrinsic symmetry constraints\u2014those not initially evident in the domain\u2014can paradoxically facilitate the network in uncovering true underlying symmetries. This finding is particularly revolutionary for robotic manipulation and control tasks, where the ability to generalize from limited samples and adapt to nuanced environments is crucial.\n\nThe methodology and results detailed in the paper provide compelling evidence of the advantages of using equivariant models over non-equivariant counterparts. For practitioners and researchers in robotic control, this represents a vital resource for developing more resilient and efficient neural network architectures.

The core finding is compelling: even when the symmetries of a problem domain are not precisely known, imposing equivariant constraints can significantly enhance the model's performance. \n\n### Key Contributions:\n\n1. **Latent Symmetry Learning**: Unlike conventional approaches that explicitly define symmetries through transformations, the study emphasizes environments where symmetries are hidden or partially observable. This has profound implications for real-world applications where explicit transformations are either unknown or infeasible.\n2. **Extrinsic vs. Incorrect Symmetry Constraints**: By categorizing symmetry constraints, the authors make a crucial distinction. They show that even incorrect symmetry constraints can be detrimental, while extrinsic (though not completely accurate) symmetric constraints often yield performance improvements. This nuanced differentiation is insightful and opens avenues for more flexible model design.\n3. **Robust Performance Across Tasks**: The paper provides empirical evidence demonstrating that equivariant models outperform traditional non-equivariant models in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. This is particularly significant for complex tasks like robotic manipulation and control, which inherently possess latent symmetries.\n\n### Critical Perspective:\n\nThe paper is well-structured and presents a thorough analysis, but it would benefit from a discussion of the potential limitations of this approach. For instance, in scenarios where the imposed symmetry is substantially inaccurate, it remains unclear how the model's performance would suffer.

This allows for a structured approach to implementing and comparing various uncertainty estimation methods. The approach covers common techniques like Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles and ventures into newer methods such as Masksembles.\n\nThe highlight of the study is the introduction of a Pareto optimization problem that balances reward performance and OOD detection efficacy. This nuanced approach is essential for practical applications, where a trade-off between performance and safety often becomes unavoidable.

The authors argue that for RL agents to be utilized successfully in real-world scenarios, they must be capable of quantifying their uncertainty and detecting OOD states. This is crucial because it helps ensure that the RL agent can identify when it encounters scenarios that diverge significantly from its training data, thereby avoiding potentially hazardous situations.\n\nThe paper first addresses the fundamental challenge that uncertainty and OOD states are not well-defined in the on-policy deep RL context compared to supervised learning. To bridge this gap, the authors propose new definitions specifically tailored for Actor-Critic RL algorithms, focusing on PPO. The paper introduces concrete measures for both value and policy uncertainty, which are incalculable for these algorithms.\n\nA notable aspect of the study is its comparative approach to different uncertainty estimation methods in RL. By implementing and evaluating existing techniques like Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles, the authors highlight their limitations and applicability to on-policy methods. Moreover, the paper proposes the innovative use of Masksembles for uncertainty estimation. Masksembles is particularly compelling as it manages to balance the trade-off between high reward performance and superior OOD detection. The Pareto optimization framework introduced in the paper further strengthens this balance, offering a novel way to simultaneously target both objectives.\n\nThe paper's experimental results are robust, showing that Masksembles significantly enhance uncertainty estimation and OOD detection without compromising the original RL agents' performance. The custom evaluation benchmark created for assessing ID and OOD states in various RL environments is a commendable contribution, offering a standardized way to evaluate similar future research.\n\n**Related Paper: Improved Actor-Critic Methods for Enhanced Robustness and Uncertainty Estimation**\n\nA related body of work that complements this study is research on improving Actor-Critic methods for enhanced robustness and uncertainty estimation.

      "abstract": "By properly utilizing the learned environment model, model-based reinforcement learning methods can improve the sample efficiency for decision-making problems. Beyond using the learned environment model to train a policy, the success of MCTS-based methods shows that directly incorporating the learned environment model as a planner to make decisions might be more effective. However, when action space is of high dimension and continuous, directly planning according to the learned model is costly and non-trivial. Because of two challenges: (1) the infinite number of candidate actions and (2) the temporal dependency between actions in different timesteps. To address these challenges, inspired by Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) in optimal control theory, we design a novel Policy Optimization with Model Planning (POMP) algorithm, which incorporates a carefully designed Deep Differential Dynamic Programming (D3P) planner into the model-based RL framework. In D3P planner, (1) to effectively plan in the continuous action space, we construct a locally quadratic programming problem that uses a gradient-based optimization process to replace search. (2) To take the temporal dependency of actions at different timesteps into account, we leverage the updated and latest actions of previous timesteps (i.e., step $1, \\cdots, h-1$) to update the action of the current step (i.e., step $h$), instead of updating all actions simultaneously. We theoretically prove the convergence rate for our D3P planner and analyze the effect of the feedback term. In practice, to effectively apply the neural network based D3P planner in reinforcement learning, we leverage the policy network to initialize the action sequence and keep the action update conservative in the planning process. Experiments demonstrate that POMP consistently improves sample efficiency on widely used continuous control tasks. Our code is released at https://github.com/POMP-D3P/POMP-D3P. ",

        "Certainly! I'll provide two coherent and interrelated reviews based on the inputs provided, focusing on the titles: \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\" and \"Fine-Tuning and Policy Degradation in Sparse Reward Tasks\":\n\n**1. SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration**\n\nThe paper \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\" presents a novel approach for enhancing the reuse of prior knowledge in Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically addressing the substantial limitations inherent in current methods of skill reuse. The authors argue convincingly that existing techniques, such as fine-tuning and expert behavior distillation, often falter due to issues such as rapid policy degradation and inefficacy with sub-optimal experts, respectively.\n\nSkillS introduces an alternative by learning to sequence existing temporally-abstract skills for exploration while simultaneously learning the final policy from raw experience. This bifurcation approach is particularly innovative as it allows for rapid adaptation and efficient data collection without constraining the final solution, a common drawback in traditional skill transfer methods. Through rigorous experimentation across multiple domains and varied transfer scenarios, this method demonstrated superior performance compared to classical techniques. Additionally, the comprehensive ablation study provided further insights into the critical components contributing to the success of their approach.\n\nOne key strength of this study is the robust comparative analysis it offers, highlighting the precise scenarios where traditional methods falter and how SkillS effectively circumvents these pitfalls. For practitioners and researchers in the RL field, this paper not only offers a new methodology but also sets a precedent for how skill transfer approaches can be critically evaluated and improved.\n\n**2. Fine-Tuning and Policy Degradation in Sparse Reward Tasks**\n\nAn important element addressed in the \u201cSkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\u201d paper revolves around the challenges associated with fine-tuning in sparse reward tasks. This common drawback in Reinforcement Learning, where initial stages of policy adaptation can cause rapid degradation, is adeptly highlighted and circumvented by the proposed SkillS method.\n\nThe authors provide a significant critique on how current fine-tuning processes often lead to policy brittleness, especially in environments where rewards are sparse. This issue is not trivial, as it considerably hampers the efficiency and outcomes of RL agents in such settings. By learning to sequence pre-existing skills specifically for exploration, SkillS not only mitigates the risk of early policy degradation but also enhances the robustness of the learning process.\n\nThrough their empirical studies, the authors validate their approach in mitigating",
        "### Review: SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\n\nIn \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration,\" the authors tackle a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that many researchers have been grappling with: the reuse of prior knowledge. Skill reuse is a promising approach but has been hampered by significant limitations, as the paper points out. For example, fine-tuning an existing policy often leads to its rapid degradation, especially in tasks with sparse rewards. Distillation from sub-optimal experts can also produce poor results.\n\nThe authors systematically compare several common approaches for skill transfer across multiple domains and varying transfer settings. They identify key failure points in existing methods, thus providing an insightful critique. What distinguishes this work is the introduction of a novel approach that splits the process into two stages: sequencing temporally-abstract skills for exploration and learning the final policy directly from raw experience. This bifurcation allows for rapid adaptation in data collection while keeping the final solution unconstrained, a balance that many classical methods fail to achieve.\n\nThe experimental results are particularly compelling. The proposed method significantly outperforms traditional approaches across various evaluation tasks. Additionally, the authors conduct a comprehensive set of ablations, underscoring the importance of each component in their methodology. This rigorous validation makes a strong case for the broader applicability of their approach, potentially setting a new benchmark for future research in this domain.\n\n### Combined Review: SkillS & Skill Sequences in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe themes explored in \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\" resonate strongly with another notable paper on the topic: \"Skill Sequences in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.\" Both studies underscore the importance of reutilizing prior knowledge and offer innovative solutions to overcome the limitations present in contemporary methods.\n\n\"SkillS\" introduces an adaptive skill sequencing method that balances exploration efficiency with the unconstrained learning of the final policy. This approach is particularly effective in settings where reward signals are sparse and system dynamics frequently change. By sequencing temporally-abstract skills and learning from raw experience, the method achieves a delicate yet powerful balance that facilitates rapid adaptation and comprehensive data collection.\n\nSimilarly, the technique discussed in \"Skill Sequences in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning\" focuses on hierarchical frameworks where high-level policies manage lower-level skills. This hierarchical approach aids in capturing the temporal dependencies between skills, providing an additional layer of adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.\n\nWhen considered together, these two papers offer a harmonious blend of methodologies and",
        "### Review 1: SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration \n\n\"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\" tackles a crucial challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) \u2013 the ability to effectively reuse prior knowledge. Skill reuse is a well-known technique in RL, but it often suffers from limitations such as the degradation of fine-tuned policies early in training, particularly in tasks with sparse rewards. This paper delves deep into these issues by comparing several skill transfer approaches across multiple domains and transfer settings, including changes in task and system dynamics.\n\nOne of the standout features of the paper is its identification of current methods' failure points and the introduction of an alternative strategy to address them. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on fine-tuning or distilling expert behavior, this new approach sequences temporally-abstract skills for exploration while learning the final policy solely from raw experiences. This separation of exploration and policy learning enables rapid adaptation and efficient data collection without constraining the final solution.\n\nThe empirical results are compelling. The proposed approach significantly outperforms many classical skill transfer methods across a diverse suite of evaluation tasks. Through comprehensive ablation studies, the authors underscore the importance of different components of their method. This thorough and methodical examination of skill reuse highlights both the innovative aspects of the proposed approach and its practical impact on RL.\n\nThis paper is an essential read for researchers and practitioners in RL who are interested in advancing skill transfer methods and improving the efficiency and flexibility of RL agents.\n\n### Review 2: Leveraging Temporally-Abstract Skills in RL: Insights from \"SkillS\"\n\nThe ability to leverage temporally-abstract skills in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for the development of general and flexible RL agents. \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\" provides significant insights into this area by evaluating various skill transfer methodologies and introducing a novel approach to overcoming their limitations.\n\nA common challenge in skill transfer is the risk of policy degradation during fine-tuning, especially in tasks with sparse rewards, and the substantial performance drop when relying on sub-optimal experts. The authors of \"SkillS\" critically examine these issues through detailed comparisons of several methods across a range of domains and transfer settings, offering a thorough understanding of where existing approaches fall short.\n\nTheir alternative solution is both elegant and effective. By learning to sequence existing skills for exploration and then deriving the final policy from raw experiences, the proposed method offers the best of both worlds: efficient data collection and high adaptability without limiting"
