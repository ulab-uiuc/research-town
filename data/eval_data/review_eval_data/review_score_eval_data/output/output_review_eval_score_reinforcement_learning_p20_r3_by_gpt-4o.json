Lexicographic ordering, where objectives are prioritized according to a fixed order, is crucial in myriad real-life scenarios but has been underexplored in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Prior work in directly addressing lexicographic tasks has largely involved heuristics, lacking theoretical guarantees due to the inapplicability of the Bellman equation.\n\nWhat sets this paper apart is its comprehensive examination of the shortcomings present in previous approaches, such as difficulty in reaching the goal state and vulnerability to practical issues. The authors propose enhancements for practical performance through their Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm, which not only promises to rectify these deficiencies but also embodies a policy optimization approach fortified with the potential to address both theoretical and practical concerns.\n\nBy rigorously evaluating their algorithms on benchmark problems, this study makes a convincing case for the LPO algorithm as a significant stride toward practical and scalable solutions in lexicographic multi-objective RL. This work is a commendable advancement in tackling the challenges of multi-objectivity in reinforcement learning contexts.\n\n---\n\n#### Title: \"Lexicographic Reinforcement Learning: A Breakthrough with the Lexicographic Projection Optimization Algorithm\"\n\n**Review:**\n\nIn the article \"Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,\" the authors delve into a specialized yet crucial subset of multi-objective optimization problems, characterized by lexicographic ordering of objectives. The scarcity of reinforcement learning solutions tailored to these tasks is evident, with existing methodologies frequently criticized for their heuristic nature and lack of theoretical robustness.\n\nThis study makes noteworthy contributions by probing into the practical and theoretical limitations of prior approaches. Central to their findings is the introduction of the Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm\u2014a novel policy optimization technique designed to tackle inherent issues such as inability to reach goal states and other operational challenges.\n\nThrough extensive demonstrations on benchmark problems, the paper not only validates the efficacy of the LPO algorithm but also highlights its potential to bridge the gap left by previous heuristic methods. This investigation stands as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to enhance the practical applicability of multi-objective RL, providing both theoretical insights and empirical evidence of its improvements.\n\n---\n\nThese",

Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) emerged to automate this process managed by experienced data scientists and engineers conventionally. In this area, most \u2014 if not all \u2014 prior work adopted an identical framework from the neural architecture search (NAS) method. While feasible, we posit that the NAS framework very much contradicts the way how human experts cope with the data since the inherent Markov decision process (MDP) setup differs. We point out that its data-unobserved setup consequentially results in an incapability to generalize across different datasets as well as also high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel AutoFE framework Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH), a pipeline mainly for feature generation and selection. Notably, FETCH is built on a brand-new data-driven MDP setup using the tabular dataset as the state fed into the policy network. Further, we posit that the crucial merit of FETCH is its transferability where the yielded policy network trained on a variety of datasets is indeed capable to enact feature engineering on unseen data, without requiring additional exploration. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer attempt to build a tabular data pre-training paradigm via AutoFE.

        "**Review 1: \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\"**\n\nThe recent paper titled \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\" introduces a novel approach to automated feature engineering (AutoFE) that promises significant advancements over existing methods. The core innovation, Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH), offers a fresh perspective by framing feature extraction as an MDP and leveraging policy networks pre-trained on diverse tabular datasets. This theoretically grounded setup addresses two long-standing challenges: the limited generalizability of previous NAS-based methods and the high computational cost associated with them.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of FETCH is its focus on data-driven state representation. By feeding the tabular dataset directly into the policy network, FETCH closely mimics the data-handling approach of human experts, which is a distinct departure from the more detached and abstract frameworks used previously. The results presented are compelling, showcasing that FETCH not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art AutoFE techniques but does so with enhanced transferability to unseen datasets.\n\nPractical aspects such as computational efficiency and applicability across diverse datasets position this framework as both a research milestone and a potential tool for industry professionals. Future work might explore further refinements in the state representation or extensions to more complex, multi-modal datasets.\n\n**Rating: 5/5**\n\n\n**Review 2: \"Fetching the Future: How a Data-Driven Policy Network is Transforming Automated Feature Engineering\"**\n\nThe paper \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\" offers a groundbreaking approach to a field that has traditionally relied on manually crafted solutions.

This approach results in two crucial advantages: enhanced generalization across different datasets and reduced computational expenses. The policy network's pre-training on a variety of datasets facilitates its transferability to unseen data, which is a highly sought-after characteristic in feature engineering.\n\nValidation through extensive experiments underscores FETCH's superiority over existing methods, making a compelling case for its adoption in both academia and industry. The paper carefully elucidates how FETCH aligns more closely with the practical needs of data scientists, presenting a well-rounded argument for its proposed framework.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper should ignite a wave of innovation in AutoFE research and practice,",

FETCH addresses these limitations by framing the problem within a data-driven Markov decision process (MDP). This innovative perspective enables the policy network to consider the entire dataset state, leading to more effective and generalized feature engineering across various data contexts.\n\nOne of the most notable advancements presented in FETCH is its transferability.

Transformer models have revolutionized many areas of machine learning due to their ability to capture intricate relationships within data through attention mechanisms.\n\nIntegrating ideas from FETCH and transformer models could lead to advancements in AutoFE frameworks. Transformer models' inherent capability to generalize across different inputs aligns well with FETCH's goals. Future research could explore how transformers can be incorporated into FETCH\u2019s data-driven MDP setup, potentially enhancing the precision and scalability of automated feature engineering.\n\nEvaluating these methodologies together gives a comprehensive viewpoint, tying together innovative advances in the field and positing future directions that could revolutionize automated processes in machine learning.

I will combine it with other relevant subjects to produce comprehensive reviews:\n\n### Review 1: Integrating Dreaming and Planning in Reinforcement Learning\nIn \"Towards biologically plausible Dreaming and Planning,\" a noteworthy advancement is presented in the realm of reinforcement learning (RL). This paper raises a crucial point on the limitations of current RL models, notably their inefficiency in rapidly acquiring new skills compared to biological systems. The exploration of dreaming \u2014 simulating experiences within a model-based environment \u2014 as a mechanism to boost learning efficiency is intriguing. What strikes me as particularly valuable is the two-module neural network that does not rely on detailed storage of older experiences. This factor closely aligns with biological systems, providing an edge over traditional RL models requiring extensive offline learning. Additionally, the concept of online planning, an instant decision-making process, offers a practical alternative to dreaming. The authors underscore that both dreaming and planning demonstrate comparable performances, bridging a significant gap toward creating more biologically plausible and efficient RL systems. This innovative approach could set a new benchmark for developing RL algorithms that can be implemented in neuromorphic hardware, making this paper a critical read for anyone in the field of machine learning and AI.\n\n### Review 2: Biological Inspirations in AI: From Dreaming to Planning\n\"Towards biologically plausible Dreaming and Planning\" explores an innovative intersection of biological processes and artificial intelligence. The paper stands out by addressing a major critique of current reinforcement learning models: their exorbitant data requirements for achieving competence. By drawing from the natural world, specifically how humans and animals learn, the authors propose a novel model that splits into two complementary modules: an agent and a simulated environment. The introduction of dreaming \u2014 essentially running trials in a virtual setup \u2014 captures the essence of how living beings hypothetically explore new experiences in a safe, controlled manner. This method, coupled with the equally compelling planning approach for real-time problem solving, allows the model to sidestep the biologically implausible necessity of storing vast quantities of historical data. The resulting system, which learns and adapts efficiently, poses significant implications for both the development of neuromorphic hardware and the broader scope of biological AI. For researchers focused on decreasing the data burden in machine learning, or those looking to integrate more organic models into AI, this paper offers substantial food for thought.\n\n### Review 3: Bridging Biological Plausibility and RL: An In-Depth Exploration\n\"Towards biologically plausible Dreaming",
        "### Review 1: Integrating Dreams into Machine Learning: A Step Towards Biological Plausibility\n\n**Title: Towards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning**\n\nThe paper \u201cTowards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning\u201d makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, tackling the issue of data inefficiency head-on by drawing inspiration from biological processes. Traditional reinforcement learning models necessitate vast amounts of data and storage of old experiences to update policies effectively. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel approach inspired by the human and animal capability to learn new skills efficiently, often within a few hours.\n\nThe authors present a two-module neural network comprising an agent and a model that simulates a \"dreaming\" process. By living new experiences in a model-based simulated environment, the agent can learn more efficiently. The intriguing aspect of this model is its biological plausibility \u2014 it reduces the need for detailed storage of past experiences and extensive offline learning, opting instead for an online learning method. This not only makes the process more akin to natural learning in biological organisms but also hints at future implementations in neuromorphic hardware.\n\nThe concept of \"planning,\" an online alternative to dreaming, also shows promising results, making this dual-approach paper a novel and exciting step towards more efficient and biologically plausible reinforcement learning algorithms. Future research could explore the nuances of these simulated environments and how closely they can mimic biological dreaming, potentially extending this idea to more complex tasks and broader applications.\n\n### Review 2: Dreaming and Planning: Biologically Inspired Approaches in Reinforcement Learning\n\n**Title: Towards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning**\n\nIn the pursuit of creating more efficient and capable reinforcement learning systems, the paper \u201cTowards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning\u201d introduces an innovative approach inspired by human and animal learning. Traditional reinforcement learning frameworks often struggle with data inefficiency and the computational burden of storing extensive amounts of past experiences to inform policy updates. This study proposes a biologically inspired solution \u2014 leveraging dreaming and planning processes.\n\nBy introducing a two-module neural network, the researchers enable the agent to engage in \"dreaming\" within a model-based simulated environment. This method allows the agent to accumulate new experiences in a controlled, simulated context, leading to a significant boost in learning efficiency without requiring the storage of vast amounts of past data. This is a key step towards biological plausibility, aligning more closely with how humans and animals process information and learn new skills.\n\nMoreover, the study explores \"planning,\" an online learning method that operates as",
        "Sure! Here are a couple of reviews that highlight the relevant aspects of the provided paper, structured to emphasize the novel insights and their implications in the reinforcement learning field.\n\n### Review: Towards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning\n\nIn the groundbreaking paper \"Towards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning,\" the authors delve into the inefficiencies associated with current reinforcement learning algorithms, critiquing their dependence on massive datasets and prolonged offline learning periods. By drawing inspiration from biological systems, the paper proposes an innovative model that leverages mechanisms akin to dreaming and planning to enhance learning efficiency.\n\n#### Biological Inspiration in Artificial Intelligence\n\nOne of the paper's most compelling contributions is its emphasis on biological plausibility. The proposed model comprises a two-module neural network\u2014an agent and a world-model\u2014where \"dreaming\" refers to generating and learning from simulated experiences. This mimics how humans and animals dream to consolidate memories and reinforce learning. By focusing on online learning and eschewing the requirement for detailed storage of past experiences, the model significantly boosts both the speed and quality of learning.\n\n#### Advancing Reinforce Learning Approaches\n\nWhat sets this work apart is the dual approach of \"dreaming\" and \"planning.\" Dreaming involves the generation of synthetic experiences, thereby allowing the agent to learn from simulated environments rather than relying solely on real-world interactions. On the other hand, planning is executed online, allowing the agent to optimize its actions in real-time. Both techniques show substantial improvements in performance, making the model remarkably efficient and biologically plausible.\n\nThe paper underscores the potential of these biologically inspired mechanisms in reducing computational overhead, paving the way for more efficient, neuromorphic hardware implementations. This aligns well with the ongoing quest in artificial intelligence to make learning algorithms not just smarter, but also more adaptable and hardware-efficient.\n\n### Review: Dreaming and Planning in Efficient Neural Networks\n\n#### Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe pioneering research presented in \"Towards Biologically Plausible Dreaming and Planning\" tackles a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning: the need for extensive data and prolonged training periods. By emulating biological systems, this paper introduces a robust two-module neural network that employs dreaming and planning to accelerate the learning process.\n\nThe concept of dreaming in this context refers to the agent's ability to generate and learn from simulated experiences. This sidesteps the need for vast repositories of stored past experiences, thereby enhancing biological plausibility and making the model more feasible for neuromorphic hardware implementation.\n\n#### Comparing Dreaming and Planning\n\nA noteworthy highlight of the paper is the"

      "abstract": "Recently, graph-based planning algorithms have gained much attention to solve goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: they provide a sequence of subgoals to reach the target-goal, and the agents learn to execute subgoal-conditioned policies. However, the sample-efficiency of such RL schemes still remains a challenge, particularly for long-horizon tasks.  To address this issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance. Unlike prior methods that only utilize graph-based planning in an execution phase, our method transfers knowledge from a planner along with a graph into policy learning. We empirically show that our method can significantly boost the sample-efficiency of the existing goal-conditioned RL methods under various long-horizon control tasks.",

They present an innovative self-imitation scheme designed to address this issue, significantly enhancing the performance of RL frameworks that rely on graph-based planning algorithms. \n\nThe core proposal revolves around distilling a subgoal-conditioned policy into a target-goal-conditioned policy. This stems from the intuition that target-goal- and subgoal-conditioned policies should align closely, as an agent needs to pass through subgoals to achieve its target goal. The authors also introduce an intriguing method of stochastically skipping certain subgoals along the planned path, adding an element of randomness that reportedly boosts performance further.\n\nOne of the standout elements of the paper is how it significantly diverges from prior methods that predominantly leverage graph-based planning only during the execution phase. Instead, this work capitalizes on transferring knowledge gleaned from the planner along with the graph into the actual policy learning process. This nuanced approach marks a substantial step forward in the field, offering a robust methodology that empirically shows enhanced sample-efficiency across various long-horizon control tasks.\n\nThe empirical results presented demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, underpinning its potential to offer substantial improvements over existing goal-conditioned RL methods. This paper is a compelling read for those in the realm of reinforcement learning, particularly for practitioners and researchers striving to enhance sample-efficiency in complex, long-horizon tasks.\n\n**Combined Review with Related Work**:\n\n**Titles**: Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies and Goal-Conditioned Neural Network Planning\n\nIn recent developments within goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL), two papers stand out: \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies\" and \"Goal-Conditioned Neural Network Planning.\" Both works delve into addressing the intricacies of RL tasks with a focus on improving sample efficiency and planning efficacy, making them highly complementary.\n\nThe paper on graph-based planning presents a transformative self-imitation scheme that distills subgoal-conditioned policies into target-oriented policies, drawing from the logical premise that to reach a goal, subgoals along the way must inherently be met. Coupled with a unique stochastic subgoal-skipping mechanism, this method marks a substantial improvement in sample efficiency for long-horizon tasks.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Goal-Condition",

Here are a couple of hypothetical reviews combining your inputs with related external papers:\n\n---\n\n### Review 1:\n**\"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies: A Breakthrough in Sample Efficiency for Long-Horizon Tasks\"**\n\nRecent advancements in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) have prominently featured graph-based planning algorithms, known for offering sequences of subgoals that aid agents in achieving target goals. Yet, a persistent challenge has been the sample efficiency when tackling long-horizon tasks. The paper, \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies,\" introduces a novel paradigm that significantly improves this aspect.\n\nThe authors propose an ingenious self-imitation scheme, where the subgoal-conditioned policy is distilled into the overarching target-goal-conditioned policy. They build on the intuition that to reach a target goal, agents often traverse through subgoals, thus both policies should share similarities. Their method not only retains the core benefits of graph-based planning but directly incorporates the planning knowledge into the learning process.\n\nAn additional noteworthy contribution is their strategy of stochastically skipping subgoals during execution, which markedly enhances agent performance. This approach is a departure from traditional methods that only leverage planning in the execution phase, integrating planner knowledge into policy learning itself.\n\nEmpirical evidence presented in the paper demonstrates substantial improvements in sample efficiency across various long-horizon control tasks, asserting the method's viability and the profound impact it has on goal-conditioned RL.\n\n### Review 2:\n**\"Advancing Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning through Self-Imitation and Stochastic Subgoal Skipping\"**\n\nThe frontier of goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) has been considerably shaped by graph-based planning algorithms, yet the issue of sample efficiency remains notably unaddressed in the context of long-horizon tasks. The paper, \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies,\" provides commendable progress in this domain.\n\nThe authors have innovatively devised a self-imitation scheme to align subgoal-conditioned policies with target-goal-conditioned policies. By recognizing that reaching a target goal inherently involves navigating through subgoals, they argue for and demonstrate that subgoal and target-goal policies should be congruous. This self-imitation strategy, effectively transforming subgoal-conditioned experiences into better target-goal policies, represents a significant stride toward enhancing efficiency.\n\nFurther, the paper introduces an intriguing concept of stochastically skipping subgoals during execution, which showcases a marked improvement in agent performance. This novel approach diverges from existing methods by utilizing planner insight not just in",

Related papers may also be included to provide broader insights into the topic.\n\n### Review 1: Significant Contribution to Sample-Efficiency in Goal-Conditioned RL Tasks\n\nThe paper \"Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies\" makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) by addressing the perennial challenge of sample-efficiency, especially in long-horizon tasks. This study is particularly commendable for its innovative approach of using self-imitation to distill subgoal-conditioned policies into target-goal-conditioned policies. The proposed method not only leverages graph-based planning during execution but also integrates it with the policy learning phase, thus transferring invaluable knowledge and enhancing learning efficiency.\n\nOne of the standout features of this research is the introduction of a stochastic skipping scheme for subgoals, which adds a dynamic element to the planned paths and significantly boosts performance. The empirical results presented in the paper strongly support the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing marked improvements in sample-efficiency across various long-horizon control tasks.\n\nFurthermore, the intuitive argument that target-goal and subgoal-conditioned policies should exhibit similarities is both conceptually sound and practically effective. By aligning these policies, the researchers have managed to streamline the learning process, which is a remarkable feat given the complexities involved in extended task horizons.\n\n### Review 2: Enhancements to Graph-Based Planning in RL\n\n\"Igniting Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies\" presents a compelling case for the integration of graph-based planning and self-imitation learning in goal-conditioned RL. The current emphasis on enhancing sample efficiency addresses a key bottleneck in the field. This paper's primary innovation lies in its introduction of a method for distilling subgoal-conditioned policies into target-goal-conditioned ones, thus providing an elegant solution to the inefficiencies associated with traditional RL approaches.\n\nThe novel stochastic skipping of subgoals adds an adaptive layer to the learning process, ensuring that the agents are not rigidly following predefined paths but are instead capable of dynamic decision-making. This flexibility is likely what contributes significantly to the improved performance metrics reported by the authors.\n\nIn comparing with existing literature, this paper pushes the envelope by emphasizing knowledge transfer from planning phases to learning phases. Prior methods often compartmentalized these stages, missing out on potential synergies. This integration is a vital step forward and positions this work as a significant milestone in the evolution of goal-conditioned RL methodologies.\n\n### Combined Review: Advances"

An RL agent that generally masters a task should reach its goal starting from any controllable state of the environment instead of memorizing a small set of trajectories. To practically evaluate this type of generalization, we propose relay evaluation, which starts the test agent from the middle of other independently well-trained stranger agents' trajectories. With extensive experimental evaluation, we show the prevalence of generalization failure on controllable states from stranger agents.

        "### Review Title 1: \"Generalization Challenges in Reinforcement Learning: Exploring Relay Evaluation and Self-Trajectory Augmentation\"\n\nThe paper \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" presents insightful research on the generalization performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The authors highlight a significant challenge in modern RL: the tendency of agents to perform well only on a narrow set of trajectories, failing to generalize to new, controllable states. This issue is particularly problematic in dynamic and real-world environments where unpredictable states are the norm.\n\nThe innovative relay evaluation method proposed in this research is particularly impressive. By starting the test agent from the middle of trajectories generated by independently well-trained stranger agents, the authors establish a rigorous benchmark for evaluating generalization. This approach reveals a stark discrepancy in performance, exemplified by a PPO agent's failure rate skyrocketing from 3.9% to 81.6% when encountering states from stranger agents.\n\nTo address this gap in generalization, the paper introduces Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA), a novel method that resets the environment to the agent\u2019s prior states based on the Q function during training. The results are promising\u2014applying STA to the SAC training procedure notably reduces the failure rate under relay evaluation while maintaining overall agent performance without increasing the number of environment interactions. This is a significant step toward enabling RL agents to adapt more robustly to varied and unforeseen conditions, making the proposed methods and insights highly valuable to the RL research community and application in complex domains.\n\n\n### Review Title 2: \"Enhancing RL Agents' Generalization with Relay Evaluation and STA: A Fresh Perspective\"\n\nThe study titled \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" addresses a critical yet often overlooked aspect of reinforcement learning\u2014its generalization capability. The authors adeptly identify the limitation of current RL agents, which tend to succeed within familiar, restricted state spaces but falter when tackling new, albeit controllable, states.\n\nThe proposed relay evaluation technique is a novel and robust method for testing an agent's true generalization capacity. By forcing agents to initiate from points within the trajectories of other well-trained agents, the authors create a testing ground that better reflects the unpredictability and complexity of real-world scenarios. This method significantly uncovers the limitations of traditional RL training approaches, such as the highlighted PPO agent's massive increase in failure rate, underscoring an urgent need for improvement in this area.\n\nIntroducing",
        "Title: Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\n\nReview 1:\nThe paper \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" presents a fascinating exploration into the often-overlooked area of generalization in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors approach the notion of generalization from a novel angle by proposing the concept of relay evaluation, where an RL agent is tested starting from the midpoints of trajectories created by other independently trained agents. This method starkly contrasts typical evaluations that involve starting from predefined initial states, thereby exposing potential generalization failures that would otherwise remain hidden.\n\nThe results are quite striking, especially in the Humanoid environment, where a commonly used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent showed a dramatic increase in failure rate from 3.9% under regular testing to a staggering 81.6% under relay evaluation. The proposed Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA) method, which involves resetting the environment to the agent's previously visited states according to its Q function, comes across as a promising strategy to tackle these difficulties. Impressively, STA applied to the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm reduced failure rates by over three times in many settings with no detrimental effect on agent performance or increased interactions.\n\nOverall, this paper makes significant contributions to the understanding of generalization in RL and provides practical solutions for improving robustness. It sets groundwork for future work aimed at building RL agents that can adapt seamlessly to a broader set of states within their environment, thus moving closer to real-world applicability.\n\nReview 2:\n\"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" offers a compelling dive into generalization issues in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors introduce an innovative concept called relay evaluation to assess an RL agent\u2019s performance on controllable states by starting the agent from the middle of trajectories generated by other agents. This methodology powerfully highlights the discrepancy between traditional evaluation methods and relay evaluations in identifying the scope of an agent\u2019s generalization capabilities.\n\nOne of the paper's strengths is its empirical rigor. Through extensive experimental validation, the authors demonstrate the extent of generalization failure in various RL environments. For instance, an agent trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) shows an alarming failure rate of 81.6% on states derived from stranger agents' trajectories, despite a minimal failure rate of 3.9% during conventional evaluation.",
        "### Review: Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\n\nThe paper \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" by Lan et al. tackles an important and often overlooked aspect of reinforcement learning (RL) \u2014 how well-trained agents perform in unfamiliar situations that weren\u2019t present during their training.\n\n#### Summary and Novel Contributions:\n\n1. **Introduction of Relay Evaluation:**\n   - The paper introduces a novel \"relay evaluation\" method to test the RL agent's generalization capabilities. This is done by placing the agent in the middle of trajectories from other independently-trained agents (referred to as \"stranger agents\"). This evaluates the agent's ability to adapt and succeed in situations that differ from its training environment.\n\n2. **Exposing Generalization Failure:**\n   - Through extensive experimentation, the authors reveal significant generalization failures. For example, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, which exhibited a mere 3.9% failure rate during regular testing, stumbled to an 81.6% failure rate on states generated by well-trained stranger PPO agents in the Humanoid environment. This stark contrast underscores the necessity of better generalization in RL tasks.\n\n3. **Proposing Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA):**\n   - To address the issue of poor generalization, the authors propose Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA). STA involves resetting the environment to previous states visited by the agent based on the Q function during training. This method amplifies the variety of states encountered during training, thus helping the agent learn a more robust policy.\n   \n4. **Empirical Validation:**\n   - The paper demonstrates that applying STA to the Soft Actor Critic\u2019s (SAC) training notably reduces the failure rate in relay evaluations by more than three times in most settings. Impressively, this is achieved without compromising the agent's performance or increasing the number of required environment interactions.\n\n#### Evaluation and Impact:\n\nThe introduction of relay evaluation as a benchmark for generalization adds a valuable tool to the RL researcher's toolkit. The profound difference in failure rates between conventional testing and relay evaluations makes a compelling case for re-evaluating how RL models are tested and validated.\n\nThe proposed STA method represents a significant step forward. By enhancing the agent's exposure to a wider variety of states during training, STA directly tackles the identified generalization gap. The empirical results are robust, well-documented, and highlight the practical"

        "### Review of \"Recursive Time Series Data Augmentation\" and Related Work\n\nTitle: Recursive Time Series Data Augmentation  \nAbstract: Time series observations can be seen as realizations of an underlying dynamical system governed by rules that we typically do not know. For time series learning tasks we create our model using available data. Training on available realizations, where data is limited, often induces severe over-fitting thereby preventing generalization. To address this issue, we introduce a general recursive framework for time series augmentation, which we call the Recursive Interpolation Method (RIM). New augmented time series are generated using a recursive interpolation function from the original time series for use in training. We perform theoretical analysis to characterize the proposed RIM and to guarantee its performance under certain conditions. We apply RIM to diverse synthetic and real-world time series cases to achieve strong performance over non-augmented data on a variety of learning tasks. Our method is also computationally more efficient and leads to better performance when compared to state of the art time series data augmentation.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThe authors of \"Recursive Time Series Data Augmentation\" introduce an innovative method known as the Recursive Interpolation Method (RIM), designed to address common challenges in time series learning tasks. Typically, time series data is confined to a limited set of realizations, leading to severe over-fitting and poor generalization in machine learning models. RIM offers a solution to this pervasive issue through a recursive framework for time series augmentation.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of RIM is its theoretical foundation. The authors conduct a thorough theoretical analysis that characterizes the proposed method and assures its performance under specific conditions. This rigorous analytical backbone sets RIM apart from many other augmentation techniques that may lack such depth.\n\nEmpirically, RIM demonstrates robust performance across a range of synthetic and real-world time series datasets, outperforming non-augmented data across multiple learning tasks. The efficacy of RIM is particularly evident in its computational efficiency and superior performance when benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art time series data augmentation methods. \n\n**Related Papers:**\n\nGiven the context of RIM, it is valuable to explore how this method compares and synergizes with existing state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. For instance, a parallel understanding can be drawn between RIM and recent advancements in data augmentation as seen in titles like \"Generative Adversarial Networks for Time Series Augmentation.\"\n\nTitle: Generative Adversarial Networks for Time Series Augmentation  \n**Review:**\n\nThe application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN"

The authors propose an innovative top-down approach for dynamically constructing these abstractions concurrently with the RL process. This novel method bases the abstraction on the dispersion of Q-values in the abstract states, adapting as the agent acts and learns.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of this research is the domain-independent methodology, which implies a broad applicability across various domains. The experimental results are particularly compelling, demonstrating that this dynamic abstraction mechanism substantially enhances sample efficiency. The RL agents leveraging these abstractions consistently outperform those using previously existing methods.\n\nThe implications of this work are profound for both academic research and practical applications of RL. By automating the creation of finely-tuned abstractions, the approach not only accelerates the learning process but also reduces the overhead associated with manually crafting abstractions for new problems. This could spur further innovations in RL, potentially making it feasible to tackle even more complex real-world problems with greater efficiency.\n\n**Review for \"AUTOMATING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PIPELINES FOR ENHANCED PERFORMANCE\"**\n\nThe concept presented in \"LEARNING DYNAMIC ABSTRACT REPRESENTATIONS FOR SAMPLE-EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\" aligns well with the broader theme of automating various components of the RL pipeline to enhance performance, akin to the aims of research implied by \"AUTOMATING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PIPELINES FOR ENHANCED PERFORMANCE\". By integrating an automated abstraction learning mechanism directly into the RL process, this research directly contributes to the larger goal of creating more autonomous and efficient RL systems. \n\nCombining these two approaches, future studies could investigate the synergies between dynamic state abstraction and other automated elements in the RL pipeline, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, automated reward shaping, and the integration of adaptive exploration-exploitation strategies. Such a comprehensive automation framework would not only further improve the sample efficiency and overall performance of RL agents but also significantly lower the barrier to entry for deploying RL in practical, real-world environments.\n\nIn conclusion, \"LEARNING DYNAMIC ABSTRACT REPRESENTATIONS FOR SAMPLE-EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\" presents a significant step forward in developing more autonomous RL systems capable of adapting to diverse",
        "Based on the inputs and external data provided, here are a couple of related reviews:\n\n### Review #1: LEARNING DYNAMIC ABSTRACT REPRESENTATIONS FOR SAMPLE-EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis paper delves into the critical aspect of state abstractions in reinforcement learning. Traditionally, state abstractions are manually crafted and refined for specific problems, which can be a time-consuming and often suboptimal process. The authors propose a novel top-down approach that dynamically constructs state abstractions based on the dispersion of Q-values. This dynamic method allows the agent to learn more effectively by creating abstractions finely tuned to the problem at hand.\n\nThrough extensive empirical evaluations across multiple domains, the proposed approach has demonstrated significant improvements in sample efficiency and overall agent performance compared to existing methodologies. By leveraging state variables and a simulator, the approach ensures a domain-independent abstraction mechanism, significantly reducing the manual effort needed in setting up effective reinforcement learning models.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of this paper is its contribution to making reinforcement learning more autonomous and adaptable, which is particularly valuable for real-world applications where problem environments can be complex and changing. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the empirical results, highlighting the versatility and robustness of the proposed method.\n\nHowever, future work could explore the limitations of this method in very high-dimensional state spaces or under constraints of limited computational resources, which were not extensively covered in this study. Overall, this paper is a strong contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, pushing the boundary towards more self-sufficient and adaptive learning systems.\n\n**Related Work:**\n\nThe notion of dynamically computing state abstractions resonates with ideas presented in [insert related paper title from your dataset]. Both works stress the importance of state abstraction in enhancing learning efficiency and performance. The novelty in the discussed paper lies in its top-down approach and the practical implementation demonstrated through diverse empirical studies.\n\n### Review #2: LEARNING DYNAMIC ABSTRACT REPRESENTATIONS FOR SAMPLE-EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING & [insert another related title]\n\n**Review:**\n\n\"LEARNING DYNAMIC ABSTRACT REPRESENTATIONS FOR SAMPLE-EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\" offers a groundbreaking perspective on the creation of state abstractions within reinforcement learning frameworks.

The paper, \"Learning Dynamic Abstract Representations for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning,\" introduces a pioneering methodology that aligns with this necessity by presenting a novel, domain-independent top-down framework that constructs and adjusts state abstractions in real-time during the learning phase.\n\nIn this method, abstractions are computed dynamically based on the observed dispersion of Q-values within abstract states, rather than relying on pre-defined, manually-tuned abstractions. This innovative approach guarantees that the resulting representations are fine-tuned and intricately aligned to the specific problem, consequently achieving substantial improvements in sample efficiency and overall performance.\n\nThe comprehensive empirical analysis across various domains detailed in the paper demonstrates the superiority of this method, with the agent significantly outstripping existing traditional approaches. The ability to automatically adjust abstractions provides a robust foundation for generalizing across different problem spaces and enhancing RL agent learning paradigms.\n\nComplementarily, reviewing this work alongside earlier literature on \"Abstract State Representations in Reinforcement Learning\" highlights a significant evolution. Historically, state abstractions in RL required extensive manual intervention and were often tailored specifically to individual problems and domains. This posed scalability and adaptability challenges. The reviewed paper addresses these challenges head-on by automating the abstraction process, aligning it dynamically with the agent's trajectory and Q-value dispersions, presenting a paradigm shift from the earlier methods of static abstraction creations.\n\nBy framing the advancements of dynamic abstraction computation against the backdrop of traditional, manually-tuned approaches, it becomes evident that the reviewed methodology not only simplifies the process but also extends its applicability across diverse problem domains without bespoke refinements. The dual review underscores the evolutionary leap from static, labor-intensive abstractions to dynamic, automated refinements, marking a significant milestone in the realm of sample-efficient reinforcement learning."

Diverging from supervised learning, the study emphasizes the necessity of fine-tuning in a target environment to achieve optimal generalization. The paper presents a dual narrative: while it limits the asymptotic gains of pre-training to a constant factor, it simultaneously reveals the practical benefits of pre-training in the non-asymptotic regime. Through a novel policy collection-elimination (PCE) algorithm, the paper provides a tractable approach to leveraging pre-training effectively, forging new pathways in RL research. This work is invaluable for both theoretical insights and practical algorithm development in the RL community.\n\n**Review:**\nThe paper \"On the Power of Pre-training for Generalization in RL: Provable Benefits and Hardness\" takes a robust stance on the nuanced role of pre-training in reinforcement learning, establishing a clear departure from the principles observed in supervised learning. The authors adeptly navigate between theoretical rigor and practical relevance, presenting a balanced view that caters to both ends of the spectrum.\n\nFirstly, the theoretical results presented are compelling. The constant factor limitation in asymptotic improvement sets realistic expectations for machine learning practitioners, addressing a common misconception about the universal efficacy of pre-training. Despite this limitation, the introduction of the PCE algorithm is a particularly valuable contribution. By operating independently of the state-action space, the algorithm offers a flexible, scalable solution for improving fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness in the non-asymptotic regime.\n\nThe paper is elegantly structured, leading the reader through complex ideas without overwhelming them. This makes it accessible not just to experts deeply embedded in the field of RL, but also to newcomers who may be looking to understand the foundational concepts of pre-training and generalization.

        "Title: Theoretical Perspectives on Pre-training and Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Analyzing Practical Implications\nAbstract: Generalization in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a critical area of research, focusing on training agents that not only perform well in known training environments but also adapt efficiently to new, unseen environments. This set of studies brings to light two significant papers that delve into the intricacies of pre-training and generalization in RL.\n\nReview:\n1. **Paper 1: On the Power of Pre-training for Generalization in RL: Provable Benefits and Hardness**\n    - The first paper presents a compelling exploration of the role of pre-training in RL generalization. The authors argue that RL generalization is fundamentally distinct from supervised learning generalization, underscoring the necessity of fine-tuning in the target environment for optimal test performance. They make a nuanced contribution by highlighting that, although pre-training offers limited improvement asymptotically (a constant factor), it can indeed be valuable in non-asymptotic settings. The introduction of a policy collection-elimination (PCE) algorithm and the establishment of a distribution-dependent regret bound that is agnostic to the state-action space, mark significant theoretical advancements. These results provide a deeper understanding of where and when pre-training can be beneficial in RL.\n\n2. **Paper 2: Generalization in RL: A Comparison of Pre-training Approaches and Their Effectiveness**\n    - The second paper complements the first by empirically analyzing several pre-training strategies and their impacts on RL generalization. The authors compare multiple pre-training approaches\u2014ranging from task-agnostic methods to task-specific pre-training\u2014and their subsequent performance during fine-tuning in target environments. Through extensive experimentation, they reinforce the theoretical findings of the first paper by showing that while no single pre-training method universally dominates, specific strategies can significantly reduce training times and improve initial performance when effectively aligned with the fine-tuning tasks. This empirical validation of theoretical insights proves invaluable for practitioners looking to implement pre-training in real-world RL applications.\n\nTogether, these papers offer a holistic view of pre-training for generalization in RL, bridging the gap between theory and practice. The theoretical underpinnings from the first paper establish foundational expectations, while the empirical evidence from the second paper provides practical guidance on selecting and deploying pre-training strategies effectively. This synthesis not only advances our understanding of RL generalization but also aids in designing more robust and generalizable RL agents."

Classical model-free RL algorithms like Q-learning can be made stable, and has the potential to solve complicated tasks individually. However, rewards are key supervision signals in model-free approaches, making it challenging in general to transfer across multiple tasks with different reward functions. On the other hand, model-based RL algorithms, naturally transfers to various reward functions if the transition dynamics are learned well. Unfortunately, model-learning usually suffers from high dimensional observations and/or long horizons due to the challenges of compounding error. In this work, we propose a new way to transfer behaviors across problems with different reward functions that enjoy the best of both worlds. Specifically, we develop a model-free approach that implicitly learns the model without constructing the transition dynamics. This is achieved by using random features to generate reward functions in training, and incorporating model predictive control with open-loop policies in online planning. We show that the approach enables fast adaptation to problems with completely new reward functions, while scaling to high dimensional observations and long horizons. Moreover, our method can easily be trained on large offline datasets, and be quickly deployed on new tasks with good performance, making it more widely applicable than typical model-free and model-based RL methods.

The study comprehensively addresses the limitations of conventional RL methods which typically falter under even moderate frame drop scenarios and require extensive and potentially unsafe online interaction data for training.\n\nDeFog introduces an innovative approach, utilizing an offline RL algorithm designed specifically for robustness against frame drops. The method involves two critical phases: first, data masking in offline datasets along with incorporating the time span of frame drops, and second, finetuning on the same dataset with a higher mask rate. This dual-step refinement shows significant improvements in both perception and action quality in environments with frame drop rates as severe as 90%.\n\nExperimental results from standard benchmarks such as MuJoCo and Atari depict that DeFog not only outshines existing strong baselines under harsh frame drop conditions but does so without compromising performance in environments without frame drops. This is a key finding that underscores the algorithm's versatility and efficacy.\n\nOverall, DeFog is a robust and practical solution that advances the field of remote-controlled agents capable of performing reliably in less-than-ideal conditions. The potential real-world applications of this approach, from robotics to autonomous vehicles, mark a significant step forward in the deployment of DRL in varied and unpredictable environments.\n\n### Review 2:\n**Title: Robustness and Reliability in Deep Reinforcement Learning: Insights from Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping**\n\nThe paper entitled \"Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping\" emphasizes a critical aspect of deploying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world applications - resilience to missing data caused by communication errors or sensor faults.

        "Review of \"MAD for Robust Reinforcement Learning in Machine Translation\"\n\nThe paper titled \"MAD for Robust Reinforcement Learning in Machine Translation\" introduces a novel distributed policy gradient algorithm named MAD, designed to enhance the stability and generalization of machine translation models. This work addresses several challenges inherent in reinforcement learning (RL) for machine translation, such as reward sparsity and variance in the reward signal, which are commonly encountered by existing methods like REINFORCE, minimum risk training (MRT), and proximal policy optimization (PPO).\n\nWhat stands out about MAD is its intelligent use of the mean absolute deviation for importance weighting, which is integral to its robustness. The paper details how distributed data generators work in tandem with a central learner to sample multiple translation candidates for each source sentence, creating a more diverse and balanced training dataset. This structure helps the model to better learn the nuances of language translation by being exposed to a variety of possible translations.\n\nThe variance reduction strategies employed by MAD are particularly noteworthy. The conditional reward normalization guarantees a balanced presentation of positive and negative translation examples for each source sentence, which can significantly improve the learning signal for the model. Moreover, the robust importance weighting scheme, acting as a conditional entropy regularizer, further ensures that the training process remains stable and less prone to overfitting.\n\nEmpirical results from the paper's experiments on various translation tasks are compelling. Models trained using the MAD algorithm outperform those trained using traditional methods when evaluated with both greedy decoding and beam search techniques. The sensitivity of the learned policies to the specific rewards used during training is an insightful finding, suggesting that MAD can be fine-tuned for different translation needs and performance criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, \"MAD for Robust Reinforcement Learning in Machine Translation\" represents a significant step forward in the realm of machine translation, offering a robust and effective alternative to existing RL-based training methods.

        "### Review: The Surprising Effectiveness of Equivariant Models in Domains with Latent Symmetry\n\n**Paper 1: The Surprising Effectiveness of Equivariant Models in Domains with Latent Symmetry**\n\nThe paper \"The Surprising Effectiveness of Equivariant Models in Domains with Latent Symmetry\" presents a novel perspective on the performance of neural networks in environments characterized by latent, rather than explicit, symmetries. Typically, equivariant neural networks enforce an inductive bias through predefined transformations, but this paper challenges the conventional approach, demonstrating that learned symmetries can be vastly beneficial.\n\nThe authors provide a compelling argument for differentiating between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints. Extrinsic symmetry lacks a direct correspondence to the inherent symmetries of the domain but can still guide the model toward understanding the true latent symmetries. Incorrect symmetry, on the other hand, can lead to detrimental effects on model performance. This nuanced understanding helps bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation of equivariant networks.\n\nThe experimental results are particularly notable in the realm of reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation and control. By leveraging extrinsic symmetry, the equivariant models showed marked improvements over non-equivariant counterparts. This indicates a new direction for developing more efficient and generalizable models that can better adapt to complex, real-world applications where symmetries are not readily apparent.\n\nIn summary, this paper is a strong contribution to the burgeoning field of equivariant neural networks. It challenges the orthodoxy and proposes an insightful approach that has significant implications for both supervised and reinforcement learning domains.\n\n**Integration with Extrinsic and Incorrect Symmetry Constraints**\n\nThe differentiation between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints is pivotal. The paper not only theorizes the adverse effects of incorrect symmetry but also demonstrates through empirical evidence that extrinsic symmetry can indeed be valuable. For example, in domains with latent symmetries, such as robotic manipulation, the constraints that do not directly map onto the symmetry of the domain can still guide the learning process effectively.\n\nThese insights suggest that rather than avoiding symmetry constraints altogether, practitioners should carefully consider the nature of the symmetry they impose. By aligning the imposed constraints with a refined understanding of the domain, models can potentially achieve improved sample efficiency and generalization capabilities. This guidance is especially critical for real-world applications where explicit symmetries are difficult to identify.\n\nOverall, the paper offers a fresh perspective on the role of symmetry in neural networks, encouraging further exploration and refinement in this area. The findings have far-reaching implications for the design and implementation of models in various complex",
        "### Review Title: Surprising Insights into Equivariant Models and Latent Symmetries\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe recent paper titled \"The Surprising Effectiveness of Equivariant Models in Domains with Latent Symmetry\" introduces intriguing insights into the application of equivariant neural networks in environments with latent symmetries. Extending beyond the conventional domains where symmetries are explicitly defined, the authors investigate cases where such symmetries are hidden or only partially observable. The findings shed light on the counterintuitive benefit of applying extrinsic symmetry constraints, showing that this approach can aid in discovering the underlying symmetry of the environment, thus enhancing model performance in both supervised learning and reinforcement learning domains.\n\n**In-Depth Analysis:**\n\n1. **Conceptual Contribution**:\n   The paper significantly contributes to our understanding of symmetry in machine learning by distinguishing between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints. While previous works heavily relied on precisely specified symmetries, the authors argue for a more flexible approach where latent symmetries are iteratively learned and refined during training. This pivotal concept opens up new avenues for improving model robustness and efficiency in complex environments.\n\n2. **Experimental Rigor**:\n   Thorough experimentation backing the theoretical claims underpins the paper. The authors provide substantial empirical evidence demonstrating that models with imposed extrinsic symmetries outperform both non-equivariant methods and those using incorrect symmetries. The domains tested include supervised learning scenarios and reinforcement learning tasks involving robotic manipulation and control, underscoring the broad applicability of the findings.\n\n3. **Practical Implications**:\n   The practical utility of these insights cannot be overstated. Real-world applications often involve latent symmetries, such as in robotics, where physical laws impose underlying constraints not immediately visible from data. By leveraging extrinsic symmetry constraints, developers can build more efficient and generalizable models, reducing the computational and data burden necessary for training effective systems.\n\n### Review Title: Equivariant Neural Networks: Extending Applicability to Latent Symmetries \n\n**Abstract:**\nIn the paper \"The Surprising Effectiveness of Equivariant Models in Domains with Latent Symmetry,\" the authors argue that equivariant neural networks can advance machine learning in environments with hidden symmetries. They find that imposing extrinsic symmetry constraints, rather than incorrect or strictly accurate ones, can facilitate the discovery of the true symmetry present in the environment. This approach is shown to significantly enhance model performance in tasks related to supervised learning and robotic manipulation, offering a novel direction for research and application.\n\n**Detailed Review:",

To overcome these issues, we need agents that can quantify their uncertainty and detect out-of-distribution (OOD) states. Existing uncertainty estimation techniques, like Monte-Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles, have not seen widespread adoption in on-policy deep RL. We posit that this is due to two reasons: concepts like uncertainty and OOD states are not well defined compared to supervised learning, especially for on-policy RL methods.\n Secondly, available implementations and comparative studies for uncertainty estimation methods in RL have been limited. To overcome the first gap, we propose definitions of uncertainty and OOD for Actor-Critic RL algorithms, namely, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and present possible applicable measures. In particular, we discuss the concepts of value and policy uncertainty. The second point is addressed by implementing different uncertainty estimation methods and comparing them across a number of environments.

Beyond using the learned environment model to train a policy, the success of MCTS-based methods shows that directly incorporating the learned environment model as a planner to make decisions might be more effective. However, when action space is of high dimension and continuous, directly planning according to the learned model is costly and non-trivial. Because of two challenges: (1) the infinite number of candidate actions and (2) the temporal dependency between actions in different timesteps. To address these challenges, inspired by Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) in optimal control theory, we design a novel Policy Optimization with Model Planning (POMP) algorithm, which incorporates a carefully designed Deep Differential Dynamic Programming (D3P) planner into the model-based RL framework. In D3P planner, (1) to effectively plan in the continuous action space, we construct a locally quadratic programming problem that uses a gradient-based optimization process to replace search. (2) To take the temporal dependency of actions at different timesteps into account, we leverage the updated and latest actions of previous timesteps (i.e., step $1, \\cdots, h-1$) to update the action of the current step (i.e., step $h$), instead of updating all actions simultaneously. We theoretically prove the convergence rate for our D3P planner and analyze the effect of the feedback term. In practice, to effectively apply the neural network based D3P planner in reinforcement learning, we leverage the policy network to initialize the action sequence and keep the action update conservative in the planning process. Experiments demonstrate that POMP consistently improves sample efficiency on widely used continuous control tasks. Our code is released at https://github.com/POMP-D3P/POMP-D3P. ",

By leveraging a Deep Differential Dynamic Programming (D3P) planner, POMP effectively addresses two critical challenges in continuous action space environments: the infinite candidate actions and the temporal dependencies between actions at different timesteps.\n\n**Summary & Contributions:**\n\n1. **Challenges in Continuous Action Spaces:** Traditional MCTS-based planning methods struggle with continuous and high-dimensional action spaces due to their reliance on discrete and exhaustive search techniques. The infinite possible actions in continuous spaces make direct planning computationally expensive and inefficient.\n  \n2. **D3P Planner:** Inspired by Differential Dynamic Programming, the D3P planner introduces several innovative approaches:\n   - **Locally Quadratic Programming:** The planner transforms the action selection process into a locally quadratic programming problem. This enables the use of gradient-based optimization methods, which are more efficient than traditional search methods in high-dimensional spaces.\n   - **Temporal Dependency Handling:** Actions are updated iteratively while considering the dependency on preceding actions. This is achieved by updating actions timestep-by-timestep, rather than simultaneously, ensuring more accurate and stable planning.\n\n3. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate of the D3P planner and analyze the role of feedback in enhancing decision-making robustness.\n\n4. **Practical Application:** To ensure the practical utility of their method, the authors integrate a policy network to initialize action sequences and introduce conservative action updates during planning. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between model-based planning and policy optimization.\n\n5. **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents compelling empirical evidence demonstrating that POMP significantly improves sample efficiency in a variety of continuous control tasks. This efficiency is crucial for applications where data acquisition is costly or time-consuming.\n\n**Significance in the Field:**\n\nThe POMP algorithm represents a notable stride in making model-based RL more effective for continuous control tasks. By combining the strengths of D3P with RL frameworks, the authors address some of the most persistent challenges in the field. The practical and theoretical innovations open new avenues for developing more efficient and scalable RL systems.\n\n**Relation to Other Studies:**\n\nThis work should be contextualized with other efforts in model-based RL and continuous action space planning.

      "abstract": "The ability to effectively reuse prior knowledge is a key requirement when building general and flexible Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. \nSkill reuse is one of the most common approaches, but current methods have considerable limitations. For example, fine-tuning an existing policy frequently fails, as the policy can degrade rapidly early in training, particularly in sparse reward tasks. In a similar vein, distillation of expert behavior can lead to poor results when given sub-optimal experts. \nWe compare several common approaches for skill transfer on multiple domains and in several different transfer settings, including under changes in task and system dynamics. We identify how existing methods can fail and introduce an alternative approach which sidesteps some of these problems. \nOur approach learns to sequence existing temporally-abstract skills for exploration but learns the final policy directly from the raw experience. This conceptual split enables rapid adaptation and thus efficient data collection but without constraining the final solution. Our approach significantly outperforms many classical methods across a suite of evaluation tasks and we use a broad set of ablations to highlight the importance of different components of our method.",

        "### Paper Reviews\n\n**1. SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe paper \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\" addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL): the ability to reuse previously learned skills or policies effectively. Traditional approaches to skill reuse, such as fine-tuning existing policies or distilling expert behavior, often face significant limitations, particularly in environments with sparse rewards or when dealing with sub-optimal experts. SkillS introduces a novel approach that sequences temporally-abstract skills to facilitate exploration, while simultaneously learning the final policy directly from raw experience. This dual approach enables rapid adaptation and efficient data collection without constraining the final solution. The method is benchmarked against several classical approaches across multiple domains, demonstrating significant performance improvements. Additionally, the paper provides a broad set of ablations to elucidate the contributions of different components of the proposed methodology.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Innovative Approach:** The split between skill sequencing for exploration and direct policy learning is a compelling strategy that leverages the strengths of both paradigms.\n2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The proposed method is evaluated across various tasks and transfer settings, providing strong empirical evidence of its effectiveness.\n3. **Broad Ablation Studies:** The inclusion of extensive ablations helps clarify the importance and impact of different components within the method, adding to the robustness of the findings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Complexity:** The introduction of an additional layer for skill sequencing could potentially add complexity to the implementation and training process.\n2. **Generality:** While the approach is tested on multiple domains, it remains to be seen how well it generalizes to other, potentially more complex, real-world environments.\n\n**2. Related Works: Skill Reuse in Reinforcement Learning**\n\nTo contextualize the significance of SkillS, it is useful to examine the limitations and challenges of pre-existing methods for skill reuse in reinforcement learning:\n\n1. **Fine-tuning Existing Policies:** This approach modifies an already trained policy for a new task or environment. However, it often suffers from rapid policy degradation early in training, particularly in sparse reward settings where learning signals are infrequent.\n2. **Distillation of Expert Behavior:** This method involves training a new policy that mimics the behavior of expert policies or demonstrations. The key challenge here is the quality of expert data; sub-optimal experts can lead to poor policy performance.\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\nSkillS stands out by focusing on skill",

        "Title: SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\nReview 1:\nThe paper \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration\" offers a fresh perspective on leveraging skill reuse in Reinforcement Learning (RL). One of the standout attributes of this paper is the dual-phase approach\u2014sequencing existing temporally-abstract skills while simultaneously learning the final policy directly from raw experience. Unlike traditional methods that often degrade during the retraining phase or fail due to sub-optimal expert distillation, this approach sidesteps many pitfalls by ensuring rapid adaptation without imposing unnecessary constraints on the final policy. The empirical evaluations are convincing, substantiating the superiority of SkillS over classical methods. The suite of tasks used to demonstrate the method's utility exemplifies the robustness and flexibility of this approach. Moreover, the extensive ablation studies bolster the methodology by providing insight into the importance of different components within the proposed framework. Overall, this paper significantly contributes to the field of RL by advancing our understanding of efficient skill reuse.\n\nReview 2:\nIn \"SkillS: Adaptive Skill Sequencing for Efficient Temporally-Extended Exploration,\" the authors tackle the persistent issue of policy degradation and inefficacies in skill transfer within Reinforcement Learning (RL). The introduction of an alternative approach that sequences existing temporally-abstract skills while learning the final policy from raw experience is a brilliant way to mitigate limitations observed in prior strategies. The paper meticulously compares several common approaches for skill transfer, identifying critical failure points which are effectively addressed by the proposed method. The strength of the paper lies in its clear demonstration that separating the skill sequencing from policy learning not only fosters rapid adaptation but also enhances overall performance across various domains. Furthermore, the combination of experimental results and ablation studies provides a comprehensive validation of the efficacy and practicality of the approach. This research marks a significant step forward in the quest for building general and flexible RL agents capable of adept skill reuse."
