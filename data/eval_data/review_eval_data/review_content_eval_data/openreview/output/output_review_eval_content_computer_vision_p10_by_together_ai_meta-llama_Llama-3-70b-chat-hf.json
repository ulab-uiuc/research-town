By introducing the concept of utilizing a long history of image observations (which they refer to as a \"cost volume\"), this work counters the limitations observed in earlier methods constrained by limited temporal history. One standout aspect of this research is its dual approach to temporal fusion: leveraging both short-term fine-grained matching and long-term coarse matching. According to the empirical findings detailed in the paper, this combination significantly enhances object perception and positioning accuracy, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks on the nuScenes dataset.\n\nMoreover, the paper delves into the theoretical underpinnings of why varying temporal differences between views can drastically affect performance. Understanding this intricate interplay enables the researchers to propose a more optimal multi-view matching setup, which further bolsters their approach. By achieving an impressive 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS improvement on the validation set, the contributions of this study set a new gold standard for 3D object detection by combining temporal depth predictions in innovative ways. Importantly, the authors have committed to making their code available, which will allow the wider research community to benefit from their findings.\n\nReview #2: Analytical and Empirical Insights Fuel Temporal Fusion Advancements\n\n\"Time Will Tell: New Outlooks and A Baseline for Temporal Multi-View 3D Object Detection\" is a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and 3D object detection.

Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings  across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model \"IT\" representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness. We further assessed the limitations of this approach and find that the improvements in behavioral alignment and adversarial robustness generalize across different image statistics, but not to object categories outside of those covered in our IT training set. Taken together, our results demonstrate that building models that are more aligned with the primate brain leads to more robust and human-like behavior, and call for larger neural data-sets to further augment these gains.",

It addresses one of the major challenges in artificial intelligence models: their sensitivity to adversarial attacks and their misalignment with human behavioral error patterns on object recognition tasks.\n\nThe authors took an innovative approach by fine-tuning state-of-the-art artificial neural network systems to align their late-stage representations with those observed in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaques. This brain area is well-documented for its role in object recognition, and thus serves as a promising template for improving AI models.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of this research is the thorough methodology employed. The authors leveraged chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings across the IT cortex in six rhesus macaques.

The use of two distinct image sets with different statistics further adds to the robustness of their findings.\n\nThe results are promising. Models refined to be more IT-like not only demonstrated improved alignment with human behavior but also exhibited greater adversarial robustness. This correlation between IT-likeness and better performance suggests that imitation of biological systems can indeed enhance artificial ones.\n\nHowever, the research also brings to light some limitations.

The work illustrates a noteworthy approach by fine-tuning late-stage model representations to align closely with those of the macaque Inferior Temporal (IT) cortex. The IT cortex is known to play a critical role in object recognition in primates, thus providing a pertinent biological benchmark.\n\nThe researchers recorded large-scale neural activities from the IT cortex across six rhesus macaques. These recordings were then used to adjust model \"IT\" representations, ensuring the preservation of object recognition accuracy while enhancing biological plausibility. The resultant models, characterized by a high degree of \"IT-likeness,\" displayed significant improvements in matching human behavioral error patterns and showed greater adversity to adversarial attacks.\n\nOne prominent finding was the correlation between IT similarity and model robustness. Models exhibiting higher alignment with IT representations demonstrated enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks, a common challenge in current artificial neural networks. This suggests that biologically inspired adjustments can strengthen model security against adversarial manipulations.\n\nHowever, the study also highlighted limitations.

Blackbox models are flexible but difficult to explain, whereas interpretable models are designed to be explainable. However, developing interpretable models necessitates extensive ML knowledge, and the resulting models tend to be less flexible, offering potentially subpar performance compared to their Blackbox equivalents. This paper aims to blur the distinction between a post hoc explanation of a BlackBox and constructing interpretable models. We propose beginning with a flexible BlackBox model and gradually carving out a mixture of interpretable models and a residual network. Our design identifies a subset of samples and routes them through the interpretable models. The remaining samples are routed through a flexible residual network. We adopt First Order Logic (FOL) as the interpretable model's backbone, which provides basic reasoning on the concept retrieved from the BlackBox model. On the residual network, we repeat the method until the proportion of data explained by the residual network falls below a desired threshold. \nOur approach offers several advantages. First, the mixture of interpretable and flexible residual networks results in almost no compromise in performance. Second, the rout, interpret, and repeat approach yields a highly flexible interpretable model. Our extensive experiment demonstrates the performance of the model on various datasets.

        "### Review 1: Insights into Spatial Information Loss in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks \nThe paper \"How deep convolutional neural networks lose spatial information with training\" provides profound insights into the internal dynamics of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and how spatial information decays as these networks train. One of the striking observations is that neural representations grow less sensitive to diffeomorphisms--transformations that warp space smoothly--as one moves deeper into the network. This desensitization to spatial alterations is contrasted by an increase in sensitivity to white noise, a phenomenon that intriguingly correlates with network performance.\n\nThe study accomplishes several objectives:\n1. **Empirical Analysis Across Architectures:** It demonstrates that for different neural architectures, stability to image diffeomorphisms is achieved primarily through spatial pooling in the initial layers and channel pooling in later stages.\n2. **Scale-Detection Task Model:** The authors introduce a simplified scale-detection task to explain the empirical observations, emphasizing how pooling layers contribute to spatial insensitivity and noise sensitivity.\n3. **Impact of Strides and ReLU Non-linearity:** The paper further explores the role of strides and ReLU non-linearity in pooling layers, illustrating how noise perturbations accumulate and impact internal layers\u2019 stability.\n\nUltimately, this work sheds light on the inherent trade-offs in CNN design between maintaining spatial integrity and managing noise sensitivity\u2014a valuable perspective for researchers seeking to enhance network robustness and performance.\n\n### Review 2: A Deep Dive into CNN Sensitivity Dynamics and Architectural Contributions\nIn examining how deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lose spatial information during training, the paper \"How deep convolutional neural networks lose spatial information with training\" presents groundbreaking findings on the interplay between spatial transformations, noise sensitivity, and network architecture. \n\nKey contributions of the paper include:\n1. **Empirical Findings on Sensitivity:** Through comprehensive empirical testing, the authors reveal that stability to diffeomorphisms in images is significantly established by spatial pooling in the early layers of the network, while the later layers leverage channel pooling.\n2. **Introduction of a Scale-Detection Task:** The scale-detection task introduced acts as an effective model to replicate and analyze the empirical observations. This model elucidates the relationship between diffeomorphism stability and noise sensitivity throughout the network\u2019s depth.\n3. **Role of Strides and Non-linearity:** The detailed investigation into strides within the network architecture and the ReLU non-linearity offers valuable insights into how noise propagates and amplifies through the layers.

The paper \"How deep convolutional neural networks lose spatial information with training\" provides a critical insight into how these networks handle spatial information over the course of training. It supports the hypothesis that deep networks build task-relevant representations by reducing sensitivity to image diffeomorphisms as the signal progresses through the architecture. Empirical evidence shows that stability to image diffeomorphisms is primarily achieved via spatial pooling in initial layers and channel pooling in the latter ones.\n\nHowever, this stabilizing mechanism comes with an unexpected consequence: an increased sensitivity to white noise. While networks gain robustness to irrelevant spatial transformations, they become more susceptible to perturbations introduced by noise. This phenomenon is crucial for researchers and practitioners, prompting a need to balance stability and noise sensitivity in network design.\n\nThe paper also presents a scale-detection task to model pooling and scaling effects, lending a theoretical framework for these empirical observations. By computing stability to diffeomorphisms and noise with depth, it highlights the significant role of architectural elements like striding in determining network robustness.\n\nOverall, this study is a pivotal contribution that underscores the trade-offs in neural network design and suggests areas for further research to mitigate adverse effects of noise sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n### Review 2: \"Noise Accumulation and Stability Trade-offs in Convolutional Neural Networks\"\nThe study \"How deep convolutional neural networks lose spatial information with training\" delves into a fundamental aspect of neural network behavior\u2014how these models transform and retain information in image processing tasks. The investigation reveals dual mechanisms: a loss of spatial sensitivity post-training paired with an unexpected rise in sensitivity to white noise.\n\nThis duality presents an intriguing paradox. As neural networks are fine-tuned for specific tasks, they progressively lose their sensitivity to diffeomorphisms\u2014transformations that do not change the essence of images\u2014which enhances task performance. Intriguingly, the process simultaneously increases susceptibility to random noise. Empirical findings attribute this phenomenon to the accumulation of noise during pooling operations, especially after ReLU activations in intermediate layers.\n\nThe paper further dives into the architectural factors influencing these dynamics.

Their empirical observations show a fascinating dual phenomenon: as networks undergo training, they tend to lose sensitivity to image diffeomorphisms while paradoxically gaining sensitivity to white noise.\n\nThis intriguing behavior is meticulously deconstructed by demonstrating the distinct roles of spatial and channel pooling across the network layers. Specifically, the first half of the network utilizes spatial pooling to stabilize against diffeomorphisms, while the latter half relies on channel pooling. This dichotomy not only elucidates the internal mechanics of these networks but also paves the way for a theoretical model capturing these empirical nuances.\n\nCoupling these insights with the paper \"Mechanisms of Robust Feature Learning in Deep Networks\" provides a broader perspective on feature learning and robustness. While the latter paper might delve into the strategies networks adopt to identify and encapsulate robust features, combined, these studies bridge the gap between loss of spatial information and the learning of robust, task-specific features. \n\nSuch a pairing underscores a recurring theme in deep learning: the trade-off between maintaining spatial integrity and enhancing task-specific robustness. Future research could potentially delve into how these mechanisms can be optimized or balanced to improve both interpretability and performance of neural networks.\n\n---\n\n### Title Combination: \"How Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Lose Spatial Information with Training\" and \"The Role of Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks: A Comprehensive Study\"\n\n#### Review:\nThe paper \"How Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Lose Spatial Information with Training\" provides an in-depth analysis of a compelling phenomenon: the reduction of spatial sensitivity as signals propagate through neural network layers. Central to this study is the observation that this reduction is not arbitrary. Instead, it is a carefully orchestrated process driven primarily by spatial pooling in the initial layers and channel pooling in the later stages.\n\nWhat makes this paper particularly valuable is its empirical grounding and theoretical modeling, demonstrating that these pooling mechanisms are critical in mediating the trade-off between stability to image transformations and susceptibility to noise.

We find that model scale and architecture have essentially no effect on the alignment with human behavioral responses, whereas the training dataset and objective function both have a much larger impact. These findings are consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected using two different tasks. Linear transformations of neural network representations learned from behavioral responses from one dataset substantially improve alignment with human similarity judgments on the other two datasets. In addition, we find that some human concepts such as food and animals are well-represented by neural networks whereas others such as royal or sports-related objects are not.

The study focuses on understanding which factors contribute to the alignment between neural network representations and human similarity judgments. The research finds that factors such as the training dataset and the objective function significantly impact alignment, while model scale and architecture do not. The findings are supported by experiments conducted with datasets of human similarity judgments from different tasks. Notably, linear transformations based on behavioral responses improve alignment across different datasets, and certain human concepts like food and animals are better represented by neural networks compared to concepts like royalty and sports-related objects.

The authors' use of linear transformations to enhance alignment across datasets is particularly innovative and showcases the potential for relatively simple adjustments to significantly improve model performance in terms of human alignment.\n\nHowever, the study also reveals some limitations in current neural networks, particularly in their ability to represent certain human concepts.

The authors present a compelling investigation into how various factors influence this alignment, focusing on model scale, architecture, training dataset, and objective function.\n\nOne of the salient findings is the minimal effect of model scale and architecture on the alignment with human behavioral responses. This insight challenges a common assumption that simply increasing model size or tweaking architecture yields better human-aligned representations. Instead, the training dataset and the objective function emerge as crucial determinants, pushing the narrative that more attention should be given to the nature and diversity of the training data.\n\nThe study's methodology is robust, leveraging three datasets of human similarity judgments collected through two different tasks. This multi-faceted approach ensures a comprehensive analysis, and the authors' use of linear transformations to improve alignment showcases innovative thinking. Particularly noteworthy is their finding that concepts such as food and animals are inherently well-represented by neural networks, whereas others like royal or sports-related objects are not.\n\nUltimately, the paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of how neural networks can be better aligned with human cognitive processes. However, it also serves as a cautionary tale\u2014indicating that scaling alone will not suffice. For practitioners and researchers, this highlights the importance of carefully curating training datasets and objectives to foster models that resonate more closely with human conceptual understanding.\n\n### Review 2: Exploring Human-AI Cognitive Parallels: Human alignment of neural network representations and its Implications\n\nIn a fascinating exploration of the cognitive parallels between humans and artificial intelligence, \u201cHuman alignment of neural network representations\u201d offers profound insights into the underpinnings of neural network cognition. This paper is crucial for the field of cognitive AI, marrying psychological insights with technological advancements to evaluate the congruence between human and neural network representations.\n\nThrough meticulous experimentation, the authors strike at the heart of a pivotal concern: what sways the alignment of neural network outputs with human thought processes? Contrary to what one might expect, the study reveals that neither the scale of the model nor its architecture significantly influences this alignment. Instead, training datasets and objective functions take center stage, underpinning the need for thoughtful dataset curation and specificity in training objectives.\n\nThe strength of this research lies in its comprehensive approach. By using three diverse datasets of human similarity judgments and leveraging linear transformations of neural network representations, the authors provide nuanced insights into the factors affecting alignment.

As computer vision models continue to achieve near-human or even human-level performance across various tasks, it's crucial to investigate how their internal representations align with human mental representations.\n\n#### Key Findings\n- The paper's investigation reveals that factors such as model scale and architecture have minimal impact on alignment with human behavioral responses. This is a critical insight since much of the current discourse in machine learning emphasizes these factors.\n- Instead, the training dataset and the objective function play more substantial roles. These results were consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected through different tasks.\n- Interestingly, the paper identifies that linear transformations of neural network representations learned from one dataset can significantly enhance alignment with human similarity judgments on other datasets.\n- It further highlights that certain human concepts, like food and animals, are well-represented by neural networks, whereas categories such as royal or sports-related objects are less well-represented.\n\n#### Implications\nThese findings suggest that simply scaling up models will not be sufficient to achieve human-like conceptual representations. Future research and development in the field of computer vision should focus more on the quality and diversity of the training datasets and the design of objective functions. Additionally, the ability to apply linear transformations to improve alignment suggests potential pathways for algorithmic improvements.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOverall, \"Human Alignment of Neural Network Representations\" provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners looking to advance the state of AI. By shifting focus towards aspects that more significantly impact alignment with human cognition, the study paves the way for the development of more human-like AI systems.\n\n### Review 2: Evaluating Neural Network Representations: Beyond Scale and Architecture\n\nThe paper \"Human Alignment of Neural Network Representations\" critically examines the parallels between neural network representations and human mental models, offering a fresh perspective on the factors that truly influence this alignment.\n\n#### Key Insights\n- Contrary to popular belief, the study indicates that neither the scale nor the architectural complexity of models significantly impacts their alignment with human behavioral responses. \n- The research underscores the significance of the training dataset and the objective function used during training. An emphasis on these two factors resulted in better alignment across multiple datasets involving human similarity judgments.\n- The findings are notably consistent across different tasks and datasets, reinforcing the robustness of these conclusions.\n- Another intriguing"

The finding that the geometry of SSL models is not dictated by the type of training paradigm (contrastive, non-contrastive, or cluster-based) challenges entrenched beliefs and underscores the need for more nuanced analyses. Additionally, the predictive capability of these geometric properties for transfer learning performance is a significant advancement, enabling practitioners to better evaluate and select models based on their potential in transfer tasks.\n\nOverall, the novel geometric perspective introduced by this work not only enhances our understanding of SSL models but also provides practical tools for improving model selection in transfer learning scenarios. This makes it a valuable contribution to the field of computer vision and machine learning.\n\n### Review 2: Unified Geometric Framework for SSL Models: Implications for Transfer Learning\n\nCombining innovative geometric analysis with the burgeoning field of self-supervised learning (SSL), \"The Geometry of Self-supervised Learning Models and its Impact on Transfer Learning\" offers a unified framework that has been notably absent in the existing literature. By moving beyond traditional parameter-based analyses, this study employs manifold graph metrics (MGMs) to reveal the underlying geometric structures of SSL model representations.\n\nA particularly compelling aspect of this research is its counterintuitive finding that the geometric properties of SSL models do not adhere strictly to their training paradigms. This revelation not only questions existing assumptions but also encourages a reevaluation of how SSL models are developed and utilized. Moreover, the ability to predict transfer learning capabilities based on these geometric properties introduces a pragmatic tool for researchers and practitioners, ensuring more informed decisions when deploying these models across various domains.\n\nThis work stands out for its methodological rigor and the practical implications of its findings, making significant strides towards a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of SSL models. The insights gained from the geometric perspective are likely to spur further research and innovation in both the theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning."
