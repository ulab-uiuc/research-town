Let's delve into reviews based on the input you provided and the external data, focusing on two related titles for a comprehensive analysis. \n\n### Review 1: A Critical Look at Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n---\n\nThis paper, *Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning*, makes a significant contribution to the domain of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). It directly tackles lexicographic multi-objective problems, which prioritize objectives in a predefined order of importance, an aspect frequently observed in real-world scenarios. The authors rightly note the scarcity of existing RL work in this niche and highlight the heuristic nature of previously proposed solutions that lack theoretical grounding due to the inapplicability of the Bellman equation.\n\nThe authors' engagement with the practical applicability issues previously noted in the literature is laudable. They go a step further by investigating other shortcomings that have not been given due attention and proposing fixes that improve practical performance. The introduction of the Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm is particularly noteworthy. This novel policy optimization approach holds promise in addressing both theoretical and practical concerns that have beleaguered the field.\n\nDemonstrations on benchmark problems are a strong feature of this work as they offer empirical validation of the proposed methods. However, while the experimental results are compelling, a detailed comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art could offer deeper insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods. Overall, this paper is a substantial step forward in the development of more effective MORL strategies for lexicographic tasks.\n\n### Review 2: Enhancements in Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning: Addressing Theoretical and Practical Challenges\n---\n\n*Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning* brings forward an insightful discourse on the application of lexicographic principles in multi-objective reinforcement learning. The paper effectively articulates the challenges in applying the Bellman equation to lexicographic multi-objective problems, an area often glossed over in existing literature.\n\nThe authors' approach, which digs deeper into previously known issues while uncovering new challenges, is both thorough and innovative. Their solutions, especially the proposed Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm, are crucial additions to the toolkit for addressing these challenges. The LPO algorithm\u2019s mechanism for policy optimization is particularly impressive because it not only offers theoretical robustness but also advances the practical performance of MORL algorithms.\n\nThe authors document the efficacy of their methods through robust benchmark problem demonstrations, attesting to",
        "Sure, here are some reviews based on the input data provided:\n\n### Review 1: \n\n**Title: Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning**\n\nThe paper \"Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\" addresses a pivotal yet underexplored domain within reinforcement learning\u2014lexicographic multi-objective problems. Such problems, which impose a hierarchical importance order over objectives, are paramount in many real-world scenarios ranging from resource allocation to automated decision-making systems. The existing literature has been primarily heuristic-focused, often lacking theoretical foundations, which prevents the reliable application of the Bellman equation.\n\nThis paper distinguishes itself by meticulously examining both the theoretical and practical limitations of existing heuristic approaches. The authors address notable issues like the inability of prior methods to reach goal states, and more generally, the algorithmic inefficacy in certain conditions. By diving deeper into these shortcomings, they do not merely identify the gaps but also propose robust fixes aimed at enhancing practical performance. \n\nTheir proposed framework, Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO), brings a fresh perspective to policy optimization under lexicographic constraints. What stands out is the dual emphasis on theoretical soundness and empirical evidence, both of which are demonstrated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems. This work paves the way for future research to build on a more solid foundation, and practitioners could potentially harness these advancements for real-world applications where multiple objectives need to be prioritized lexicographically.\n\n### Review 2:\n\n**Title: Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning: A New Approach with Thresholded Policies and Lexicographic Projection Optimization**\n\nThe paper under review makes significant strides in the niche but impactful area of Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (LMORL). Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques often fall short when applied to lexicographically ordered objectives due to the inherent complexity and hierarchical nature of these problems. Prior work has somewhat addressed these challenges but largely through heuristic means, which lack the theoretical rigor needed for robust application.\n\nThis research highlights these gaps, beginning with a comprehensive critique of existing methodologies. The authors do an excellent job of pointing out critical issues such as the failure to reach goal states and various inefficiencies that plague these heuristic models. By addressing these nuanced shortcomings, the paper sets a solid foundation for introducing a more reliable approach.\n\nAt the heart of their contribution is the Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm, which integrates thresholded policies for a more precise handling of lexicographic order. This method stands out due to its potential to",
        "### Review 1: Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning \u2013 Addressing Real-life Scenarios with Theoretically Sound Approaches\n\nOne of the latest advances in the area of multi-objective reinforcement learning is presented in the paper \"Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning.\" This work addresses the complicated yet crucial issue of lexicographic multi-objective problems by providing a fresh perspective on how these problems can be approached more effectively. \n\nLexicographic multi-objective problems are common in real-world scenarios, where certain objectives are strictly more important than others. Prior research in this domain was mainly heuristic without theoretical guarantees, as the Bellman equation did not apply to these lexicographic tasks. Existing methods also faced significant practical issues, such as failure to achieve the goal state.\n\nThis paper provides a dual contribution. First, it investigates and highlights the shortcomings of current heuristic approaches, shedding light on why they struggle with theoretical and practical challenges. Second, it introduces a new algorithm called Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO), designed to address both the theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility concerns better. Through a series of benchmark problems, the authors demonstrate how LPO can outperform existing methods, achieving more reliable and efficient outcomes.\n\n### Review 2: LPO Algorithm - Bridging the Theory-Practice Divide in Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe paper \"Thresholded Lexicographic Ordered Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\" makes a significant stride in the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) community by proposing the Lexicographic Projection Optimization (LPO) algorithm.\n\nLexicographic ordering of objectives is crucial in numerous applications, where priorities need to be strictly adhered to. Historically, reinforcement learning approaches to such problems have faced numerous hurdles. Previous methods lacked a theoretical backbone due to the non-applicability of the Bellman equation and encountered practical issues, such as not reaching the goal state.\n\nThe authors address these challenges head-on by first dissecting the limitations of existing heuristic methods. Their critical analysis paves the way for their novel LPO algorithm, a policy optimization approach designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The LPO algorithm provides a structured method to handle lexicographic ordering, thus ensuring the theoretical guarantees which previous methods lacked. Furthermore, it improves practical performance significantly, as demonstrated by various benchmark problems included in the study.\n\nThis paper is an essential read for anyone involved in MORL, offering both a clear expos\u00e9 of current methodologies' weaknesses and a promising new direction to address"

        "### Review of \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\"\n\nThe paper \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\" addresses a crucial bottleneck in the realm of tabular data analysis: feature engineering. Traditionally a manual and highly domain-specific process, feature engineering has seen significant improvements with the emergence of automated methods (AutoFE). Most prior approaches have relied on frameworks adapted from neural architecture search (NAS) methods, which though effective, are resource-intensive and not optimally aligned with how human experts approach the data.\n\n#### Novelty and Methodology:\n\nThe core of the paper\u2019s innovation lies in proposing a novel AutoFE framework named **Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH)**. FETCH diverges from NAS-based methods by incorporating a new Markov decision process (MDP) setup which integrates tabular datasets as inputs to the policy network. This data-driven MDP setup allows for the feature engineering process to be more consistent with the domain-specific nuances examined by human data scientists.\n\nOne of the standout propositions is the enhanced transferability of the policy network developed in FETCH. By training on diverse datasets, FETCH's policy network can generalize to unseen datasets effectively without requiring additional computationally expensive exploration. This highlights a significant advancement in AutoFE, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable solutions in data science workflows.\n\n#### Empirical Validation:\n\nThe paper is backed by extensive experiments that benchmark FETCH against existing state-of-the-art AutoFE methods. The results systematically demonstrate FETCH's superiority in terms of performance and computational efficiency. This empirical validation strengthens the credibility of FETCH and asserts its potential to be a game-changer in automated feature engineering.\n\n#### Related Work:\n\nThe work resonates closely with advancements in neural architecture search and automated machine learning (AutoML). One paper that aligns well with the underpinnings of this research is \"Automated Machine Learning for Table Data Analysis\", which investigates similar thematic concerns in automating aspects of data science, albeit with a focus on the end-to-end pipeline rather than specialized components such as feature engineering. As the AutoML landscape evolves, integrating robust and transfer learning-friendly AutoFE frameworks like FETCH could significantly streamline and automate tabular data modeling, fostering a more efficient workflow in data-intensive domains.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOverall, \"Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering\" carves a promising path forward in the automated feature engineering landscape. By reframing the MDP setup to reflect how human experts interact with data, FETCH not only achieves state-of-the-art"

The authors tackle this issue by introducing a two-module neural network designed to mimic the process of dreaming. Essentially, this involves creating new experiences within a model-based simulated environment, which significantly accelerates the learning process.\n\nWhat makes this approach particularly compelling is its alignment with how biological organisms operate.

To address this issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance.

To practically evaluate this type of generalization, we propose relay evaluation, which starts the test agent from the middle of other independently well-trained stranger agents' trajectories.

        "### Title: Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories, and Evaluating RL Generalization with Relay Evaluation: A Comprehensive Review\n\n### Abstract\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agents have demonstrated remarkable prowess in mastering tasks within controlled environments. However, their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) trajectories remains a critical challenge. In \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories,\" the authors introduce a novel evaluation scheme called relay evaluation to scrutinize this generalization capability. The study illustrates significant failures in generalization, even among high-performing agents, and proposes an innovative solution called Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA) to mitigate these failures. This review will explore the methods, findings, and implications of this research, emphasizing relay evaluation's role in advancing RL generalization.\n\n### Key Findings and Methodologies\nThe paper highlights a critical gap in RL: an agent's inability to generalize across OOD trajectories. The authors propose relay evaluation as a means to rigorously test this capability. Here are the key components of their methodology and findings:\n\n1. **Relay Evaluation:** The testing framework involves starting a test agent from the middle of trajectories generated by other well-trained, independent agents. This scenario simulates real-world unpredictability where an agent must adapt to new states not encountered during its training. The framework exposed an alarming failure rate in agents, as illustrated by a PPO agent in a Humanoid environment that transitioned from a 3.9% failure rate to 81.6% under OOD conditions.\n\n2. **Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA):** To tackle the relay generalized failures, STA was proposed. This method resets the environment to previous states that the RL agent has encountered, guided by the Q function during training. The incorporation of STA into the training regime of the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm resulted in a significant reduction in failure rates during relay evaluation\u2014improving reliability over 300% in most experimental setups without adding extra training overhead.\n\n### Implications for Future Research\nThe novel relay evaluation framework and STA method introduced by the authors contribute valuable tools for future RL research and applications. Here are key implications and areas for further exploration:\n\n1. **Benchmarking Generalization:** Relay evaluation provides a robust benchmark for assessing an RL agent's generalization ability. Future research could standardize this evaluation across various environments and tasks to create a comprehensive dataset for comparing RL algorithms",
        "### 1. Title: Improving Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: A Study on Relay Generalization and Self-Trajectory Augmentation\n\n**Review:**\nThis paper addresses a critical and often overlooked issue in reinforcement learning (RL): the ability of agents to generalize across unseen states, which is referred to as \"relay generalization.\" The authors introduce an innovative evaluation method called relay evaluation to test RL agents' generalization capabilities more rigorously. They note that RL agents, while proficient in controlled environments, often fail to perform well when tested on trajectories created by other independently well-trained agents. This starkly highlights the prevalence of generalization failure even among well-trained agents.\n\nFor instance, in the Humanoid environment, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that had a failure rate as low as 3.9% during standard testing failed a staggering 81.6% of the time in the relay evaluation. This indicates the limited capacity of conventional RL methods to handle varied and out-of-distribution states, which is a significant drawback for applications requiring robust generalization.\n\nThe proposed method, Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA), demonstrates the potential to bridge this generalization gap effectively. By resetting the training environment to the agent's previous states informed by the Q function, STA facilitates a broader exposure to diverse state spaces during training. As a result, an agent trained using the STA technique, particularly the Soft Actor Critic (SAC), exhibited a dramatic reduction in failure rates during relay evaluation \u2013 more than threefold in many cases \u2013 without compromising overall performance or increasing environment interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by focusing on a practical and pervasive challenge. The introduction of relay evaluation provides a more stringent test for generalization performance, while STA offers a promising solution to enhance the robustness of RL agents.\n\n### 2. Title: Can Agents Excel with Strangers? Evaluating and Enhancing Generalization in RL using Relay Races and STA\n\n**Review:**\nThe research presented in this paper explores a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) \u2013 the ability of agents to generalize across out-of-distribution states. The authors propose a novel evaluation method called relay evaluation to assess this aspect. In this setup, an agent starts from states within the trajectories of other well-trained agents, effectively pushing the agent's ability to adapt to novel conditions.\n\nThe findings reveal a concerning issue: well-trained agents, such as those using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, significantly under",
        "### Review: Agents' Generalization Performance in Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe paper \"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" addresses an important yet often overlooked aspect of reinforcement learning (RL)\u2014the generalization of agents to unfamiliar states. The authors propose a novel relay evaluation metric to test how well an RL agent can adapt to the trajectories generated by independently trained agents. This approach serves as a more rigorous test of generalization compared to standard evaluations that often rely on a limited set of trajectories the agent is already familiar with. The findings are alarming but insightful: well-performing agents, such as those based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), show a substantial drop in performance when tasked with unknown trajectories, signaling a broader issue in RL generalization capabilities.\n\nOne of the key strengths of this paper is its methodological innovation, particularly the proposed Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA) technique. By resetting the environment to old states according to the Q function during training, the authors were able to significantly enhance the generalization capabilities of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) agents. Notably, STA led to a dramatic reduction in failure rates without compromising other performance metrics or necessitating additional environment interactions. This makes STA a highly practical method for RL training.\n\nThe paper's extensive experimental evaluation across various environments, especially the detailed analysis in the Humanoid environment, adds robustness to the conclusions drawn. The startling revelation that a typically high-performing PPO agent could fail in over 81.6% of out-of-distribution states generated by stranger agents underscores the broader applicability and necessity of the proposed relay evaluation.\n\n### Review: Towards Robust RL Generalization with STA\n\n\"Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories\" is a compelling contribution to the RL community, presenting both a novel evaluation framework and an innovative training method to address generalization issues. The primary thrust of the paper is the introduction of the relay evaluation, designed to challenge RL agents with out-of-distribution trajectories generated by independently trained agents. This method departs from the conventional in-distribution training paradigm and pushes the boundaries of RL generalization testing.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting aspect is the Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA) method. By recycling past states in training based on the Q function, STA effectively enhances the agent's exposure to a broader state space without demanding extra interactions with the environment. The results are promising: applying STA to the SAC training process yielded a significant decrease in"
