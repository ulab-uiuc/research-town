However, the repeated sharing of parameters can lead to significant information leakage, jeopardizing data privacy. The papers \"Share Your Representation Only: Guaranteed Improvement of the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in Federated Learning\" and \"Differentially Private Federated Representation Learning: A Comprehensive Study\" present innovative solutions that aim to address this fundamental challenge by improving the privacy-utility trade-off.\n\nThe first paper, \"Share Your Representation Only: Guaranteed Improvement of the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in Federated Learning,\" proposes a novel method called \\DPFEDREP. This approach focuses on refining the shared representation part of the model while preserving differential privacy guarantees. Instead of sharing all parameters, only a subset that represents the feature space is shared. Impressively, the authors have proven that despite the non-convex nature of the objective in a linear representation setting, their algorithm converges to a ball centered around the global optimum at a linear rate. The radius of this convergence ball is inversely proportional to the privacy budget, ensuring high utility even under strict privacy constraints. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks using CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EMNIST datasets reveal substantial performance improvements over previous methods with the same privacy budget. The best practices and empirical validation underscore the practical viability of their approach.\n\nBuilding on these foundations, the second paper, \"Differentially Private Federated Representation Learning: A Comprehensive Study,\" delves deeper into the complexities of implementing federated learning with differential privacy. The authors survey and compare various state-of-the-art techniques for achieving this delicate balance. Through rigorous empirical analyses and theoretical insights, this paper highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. One of the key findings is that methods like \\DPFEDREP provide a substantial advance in terms of both privacy and utility, offering a $\\sqrt{d}$ improvement in the privacy-utility trade-off, where $d$ is the input dimension. This is a significant advancement, as it directly addresses the common critique that differential privacy mechanisms often hamper model performance.\n\nBoth papers make a compelling case for adopting representation learning in federated settings combined with modern privacy techniques.

This approach is intriguing as it shifts the focus from sharing raw parameters to a more abstract form, thus reducing the risk of data leakage.\n\nOne of the primary strengths of this paper is its strong theoretical underpinning. The authors prove that their algorithm can achieve near-optimal solutions with a privacy-utility trade-off that surpasses existing methods by a significant margin, specifically a factor of $\\sqrt{d}$. This advancement in theoretical guarantees is a substantial step forward in the field of federated learning.\n\nThe empirical results further solidify the claims made in the theoretical section. By evaluating their method on well-known image classification benchmarks like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EMNIST, the authors demonstrate notable improvements in performance even when operating under stringent privacy budgets. This dual validation, both theoretical and empirical, adds considerable weight to their claims and showcases the practical viability of \\DPFEDREP.\n\nHowever, one area that could be further explored is the scalability of the proposed method in extremely large and heterogeneous federated networks. While the datasets used for evaluation are standard benchmarks, real-world applications often involve more variability and complexity, which could impact the performance of the algorithm.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a significant contribution to the federated learning community by improving the privacy-utility trade-off through a novel representation-sharing approach.

Practically, the data across clients are always heterogeneous, i.e., not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID), making the local models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of the initial (or global) model.

        "**Review 1: A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning**\n\n**Abstract Analysis:**\nThe paper, \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning,\" introduces an intriguing method by marrying hierarchical Bayesian modeling with federated learning (FL). Utilizing hierarchical structures provides a robust generative model for the data produced at the client level while maintaining the privacy of client's data, a fundamental aspect of FL. The authors articulate that this novel approach not only substantiates existing FL methodologies like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox under a theoretically sound framework but also extends them through a principled Bayesian interpretation.\n\n**Key Contributions:**\n1. **Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling**: The paper constructs a hierarchical Bayesian model capturing the local and global distributions underlying FL data. By representing clients' local data using hierarchical Bayesian structures, the approach inherently aligns with FL requirements whereby data privacy is preserved.\n   \n2. **Variational Inference and Optimization**: The application of variational inference to the hierarchical Bayesian model surprisingly simplifies into a block-coordinate descent algorithm. This optimization process delineates a decentralized algorithm congruent with FL by ensuring privacy.\n\n3. **Algorithmic Insights**: A significant highlight is the revelation that well-regarded FL algorithms like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox form special instances of their broader block-coordinate descent approach. This not only provides robust theoretical backing for these existing algorithms but also suggests potential enhancements and new avenues for exploration.\n\n4. **Performance Assurances**: Convergence and generalisation analyses presented in the paper are noteworthy. The convergence rate at \\(O(1/\\sqrt{t})\\) mirrors that of centralized SGD, suggesting that the proposed decentralized approach does not sacrifice performance. Additionally, the generalisation error analysis assures that the model's performance improves with larger training data, reinforcing its practical utility.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis paper demonstrates a remarkably synthesized method leveraging hierarchical Bayesian strategies to refine and extend federated learning.

        "### Review 1: Hierarchical Bayesian Model in Federated Learning - A Game Changer\n\nThe paper titled \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning\" introduces a groundbreaking methodology that addresses one of the fundamental challenges in Federated Learning (FL): balancing model performance with data privacy. The authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that encapsulates the generative processes of clients' local data via hierarchical Bayesian modeling. This not only enriches the theoretical framework of FL but also substantiates widely-used algorithms like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox, which previously lacked robust theoretical underpinnings.\n\nWhat stands out about this research is its dual advantage. First, the proposed variational inference method transforms the Bayesian model into an optimization problem, effectively resulting in a distributed algorithm that adheres to FL norms, ensuring that private data remains on the client-side. This is crucial for applications in healthcare, finance, and any domain where data privacy is paramount. Second, the convergence analysis solidifies the model's reliability, showing that the algorithm converges to a local optima at a rate comparable to centralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n\nMoreover, the paper goes beyond algorithmic innovation by providing a comprehensive generalization error analysis, indicating that the model's test error on unseen data diminishes with the expansion of training data. This assurance of asymptotic optimality is a significant stride in making FL an attractive choice for real-world scenarios where data privacy and model accuracy are both non-negotiable.\n\nOverall, this hierarchical Bayesian approach not only elevates the theoretical rigour of FL but also paves the way for more effective and private distributed learning models. \n\n### Review 2: Bridging Theory and Practice in Federated Learning Through Hierarchical Bayesian Models\n\nIn \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning,\" the authors present a novel, theoretical foundation that significantly enhances the conceptual and practical efficacy of Federated Learning (FL). The hierarchical Bayesian model they propose meticulously describes the generative process of clients' local data, forming a robust basis upon which local models are controlled by a global variate. This structure leads to an innovative variational inference that converts the hierarchical Bayesian model into an optimization problem optimized through a block-coordinate descent algorithm.\n\nOne of the most compelling contributions of this paper is its ability to naturally extend well-established FL algorithms like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox. Prior to this work, these algorithms were often employed based on heuristic and empirical practicalities. By situating them within a rigorous Bayesian framework, the authors not only provide theoretical validation but also extend their functionality,"

Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful technique that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a Machine Learning model while keeping their data private. However, the synchronous aspect often leads to bottlenecks because faster devices have to wait for slower \"stragglers,\" thus slowing down the entire training process. Traditional methods that drop stragglers' updates entirely miss the opportunity to benefit from their unique data contributions.\n\n#### Strengths:\n\n1. **Novel Aggregation Scheme**: Kuiper introduces a novel aggregation mechanism tailored for asynchronous federated learning (Async-FL). This allows devices to learn at their own pace, thus solving the straggler problem more efficiently.\n   \n2. **Heterogeneous Compatibility**: The paper explicitly addresses the challenges faced by edge devices, which typically have low computational power. Kuiper's design optimizes for these scenarios, making it a significant contribution for video-action-recognition tasks on such devices.\n   \n3. **Performance Metrics**: Kuiper shows a marked improvement in performance metrics. Specifically, it achieves a 11% faster convergence compared to Oort15 [OSDI-21], which is notable. Furthermore, it demonstrates up to 12% and 9% improvements in test accuracy compared to FedBuff16 [AISTAT-22] and Oort [OSDI-21] respectively on the HMDB51 dataset, and 10% and 9% on the UCF101 dataset.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n\n1. **Complexity**: The novel aggregation scheme, while effective, seems complex and may require careful tuning and deep understanding for proper implementation.\n   \n2. **Device Variability**: Kuiper's effectiveness in extremely diverse environments with a mix of high-end and very low-end devices was not thoroughly explored.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nKuiper is a commendable advancement in the realm of Federated Learning, particularly for mobile and edge devices with non-IID data distribution. Its novel approach to mitigating the straggler problem and its compatibility with heterogeneous devices make it a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n### Review 2: Comparative Analysis of Kuiper and Conventional Federated Learning",

The synchronous method's straggler problem is well-known, where faster clients are held up by slower ones, reducing overall system efficiency. Conventionally, the updates from these stragglers are completely discarded, a strategy that results in lost opportunities for robust learning, especially in a non-IID data setting.\n\nKuiper effectively tackles this problem by introducing an innovative aggregation scheme that mitigates the straggler issue while acknowledging the heterogeneity of clients' data distributions. This method allows for more efficient utilization of available data and computational resources.\n\nThe results are impressive. Kuiper demonstrates an 11% faster convergence than Oort15 [OSDI-21] and exhibits noticeable improvements in test accuracy: up to 12% and 9% compared to FedBuff16 [AISTAT-22] and Oort [OSDI-21], respectively, on HMDB51. Additionally, it shows 10% and 9% improvements on UCF101, underlining its robust performance across different datasets.\n\n**Strengths**\n1. **Data-Heterogeneity Handling**: Kuiper is particularly adept at dealing with non-IID data distributions, a common real-world scenario, enhancing its practical applicability.\n2. **Faster Convergence**: The reduction in training time by 11% is a significant milestone in FL, particularly for video action recognition tasks that are computationally intensive.\n3. **Improved Accuracy**: The substantive accuracy gains observed on benchmark datasets underline the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation scheme.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n1. **Implementation Complexity**: While the aggregation scheme provides substantial benefits, its complexity may pose challenges for practical implementation on heterogeneous edge devices.\n2. **Generalizability**: The primary evaluation is on video-action-recognition tasks; further studies on varying types of tasks would cement Kuiper's utility across a broader range of applications.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nKuiper sets a new benchmark for asynchronous federated learning on resource-constrained, heterogeneous mobile devices with non-IID data.

        "### Review: Kuiper: Moderated Asynchronous Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Mobile Devices with Non-IID Data\n\n#### Overview:\n\nFederated learning (FL) is increasingly popular for privacy-preserving training of machine learning models across multiple clients. However, traditional synchronous federated learning (Sync-FL) methods suffer from the 'straggler' problem, wherein slower devices hold back the training process. Asynchronous federated learning (Async-FL) offers a compelling alternative by allowing devices to operate at their own pace. Kuiper represents a new development in this domain, focusing particularly on the challenges posed by heterogeneous mobile devices engaged in video action recognition tasks with non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data.\n\n#### Strengths:\n\n1. **High Efficiency**: Kuiper addresses a significant weakness of Sync-FL by solving the straggler problem. It shows an 11% faster convergence rate compared to existing solutions like Oort [OSDI-21], making it highly advantageous for practical deployment scenarios where computational resources are limited and efficiency is paramount.\n\n2. **Enhanced Test Accuracy**: The new aggregation scheme introduced in Kuiper yields up to 12% and 9% improvement in test accuracy on the HMDB51 dataset compared to FedBuff [AISTAT-22] and Oort [OSDI-21] respectively. On the UCF101 dataset, these numbers are 10% and 9% respectively, underscoring its efficacy across different datasets.\n\n3. **Adaptive to Heterogeneity**: Kuiper is designed to cater to varied data distributions and computational capabilities across clients. This makes it particularly useful for real-world scenarios where edge devices are often not uniform in terms of power and connectivity.\n\n4. **Non-IID Data Handling**: Traditional FL strategies tend to struggle with non-IID data. Kuiper's approach to such data distributions makes it a robust solution for federated learning applications requiring sensitivity to variable data types and distributions.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n\n1. **Complexity of Setup**: While Kuiper simplifies the straggler problem, the initial setup and parameters can be intricate and may require expertise to deploy correctly.\n\n2. **Computational Overhead**: Although the Async-FL approach of Kuiper mitigates stragglers, it may introduce other computational overheads that need balancing against its benefits. \n\n3. **Limited Scope**: While the paper demonstrates significant improvements in video action recognition tasks, the performance across other ML tasks or on different types of data remains an"

This paper stands out by providing theoretical guarantees, establishing an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives when the data is non-IID. The practical significance of this is substantial; by offloading computationally intensive tasks to the server, SL becomes a viable option for environments constrained by computational resources. Experimental comparisons indicate that SL can outperform Federated Learning (FL) in terms of convergence rate and computational efficiency, particularly on mildly non-IID data. However, FL remains superior in scenarios featuring highly non-IID data.

The latter paper introduces innovative methods to dynamically optimize learning rates and gradient updates tailored to the unique circumstances of SL. When these two studies are combined, the outcome is a more holistic understanding of SL's potential. The convergence analysis confirms the foundational effectiveness of SL, while adaptive optimization techniques provide the necessary tools to fine-tune this performance in diverse and dynamic data environments.

        "Certainly! Here are some reviews based on the paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\":\n\n### Review 1: Comprehensive Convergence Analysis for Split Learning on Non-IID Data\nThe paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" provides a thorough and insightful convergence analysis of Split Learning (SL) in the context of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This topic is crucial given the practical implications of SL in training AI models collaboratively between clients and servers, especially in resource-constrained environments. \n\nThe authors establish a significant finding that SL exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives on non-IID data, a result that aligns well with the experimental observations presented. This rigorous analysis is particularly impactful as it lays the groundwork for informed hyperparameter selection, which has been a non-trivial aspect of deploying SL in real-world scenarios.\n\nOne notable strength of the paper is the comparative study, where SL's performance metrics are weighed against those of Federated Learning (FL). The experimental results demonstrate that SL can surpass FL in terms of convergence rate per-client training/communication rounds on mildly non-IID data. This highlights SL's potential in applications where computational efficiency is paramount. However, the paper also candidly addresses the limitations of SL, noting that FL tends to be more effective on highly non-IID data scenarios.\n\nOverall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the literature on distributed machine learning, particularly in understanding and optimizing the performance of SL in diverse data environments.\n\n### Review 2: Split Learning vs. Federated Learning: A Nuanced Convergence Analysis\nIn the paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data,\" the authors address a critical gap in the current research by providing a detailed convergence analysis of Split Learning (SL), particularly under non-IID data conditions. The significance of this work is underscored by the growing interest in SL due to its ability to partition model training between clients and servers, enhancing feasibility for clients with limited computational resources.\n\nThe $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate presented for SL in non-convex scenarios on non-IID data is a key theoretical contribution. This result not only enhances our understanding of SL but also serves as a practical guide for selecting appropriate hyperparameters for training. The balance between theoretical analysis and experimental validation strengthens the credibility of the findings.\n\nThe comparative analysis between SL and Federated Learning (FL) is"

        "### Title: Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\n\n**Review:**\n\nThe paper \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" provides critical insights into the propagation of biases in federated learning frameworks. One of the key takeaways is the identification of how a few participants' bias against under-represented groups\u2014identified by sensitive attributes like gender or race\u2014can permeate and propagate throughout the entire network. This bias propagation is, however, distinctively higher in federated learning compared to centralized training models trained on the union of all datasets from participating parties. This strongly suggests that the inherent algorithms within federated learning are the primary contributors to this bias.\n\nThe paper meticulously dissects the ways bias gets encoded in certain model parameters and amplifies over time, leading to larger dependencies on those sensitive attributes. This stealthy yet significant increase in bias highlights the crucial necessity for auditing group fairness in federated learning models and calls for the design of algorithms that not only sense but also counteract these propensities towards bias. The real-world implications of this research are far-reaching and necessitate an actionable approach to mitigate the unintended yet harmful effects of biased AI outcomes.\n\n### Title: Assessing the Integrity of Federated Models: Auditing Mechanisms and Fairness Improvements\n\n**Review:**\n\nBuilding on the understanding from \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning,\" this paper explores concrete mechanisms to audit and improve fairness in federated learning systems. Knowing that federated learning can unintentionally propagate bias more than centralized training, this paper provides practical steps and mechanisms for assessing the integrity and fairness of these distributed models.\n\nThe proposed auditing mechanisms in the paper include routine examinations of model parameters to identify and address bias before it can propagate widely. By leveraging real-world datasets and naturally partitioned data segments, the paper ensures that the proposed solutions are both implementable and effective in practical settings.\n\nMoreover, fairness improvements are also discussed, focusing on algorithmic modifications that prevent the disproportionate impact of sensitive attributes on the global model. These adjustments are designed to make the federated learning framework robust to biases from individual parties, ensuring a more equitable outcome across the board.\n\nIn summary, this paper not only highlights the crucial problem of bias in federated learning but also provides viable solutions for auditing and improving fairness, making it a significant contribution to the field.\n\n### Combined Review: Bias and Fairness in Federated Learning: Challenges and Solutions\n\nThe tandem reading of \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" and \"Assessing the Integrity of Federated Models: Auditing Mechanisms and Fairness Improvements",
        "Title: Bias Mitigation Strategies in Federated Learning\n\nReview:\nIn the groundbreaking work \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning,\" the authors lay a stark warning about the perils of bias in federated learning models. This study underscores how group fairness can be spectacularly compromised due to the propagation of bias across participating parties. The authors' analysis on real-world datasets reveals that a few parties harboring biases against under-represented groups, identifiable by sensitive attributes like gender or race, can inadvertently contaminate the entire network. This contamination occurs because biased parties encode their biases into specific model parameters. Unlike centralized training, where a model is built on the union of all data and thus presents a more mitigated form of bias, federated learning networks exhibit an exacerbated bias due to the decentralized algorithm.\n\nThe implications of this study are pivotal for the future development and implementation of federated learning systems. It calls for a robust mechanism to audit and ensure group fairness. The findings suggest not just an urgent need for audits but also the necessity to redesign the learning algorithms to be inherently resilient to bias propagation. The consideration of bias as a system-wide issue, rather than an isolated problem, is an important perspective shift for researchers and practitioners alike.\n\nTitle: Toward Fair Federated Learning: Bias Mitigation Strategies\n\nReview:\nThe findings of \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" highlight critical vulnerabilities in federated learning models, emphasizing how a minority of biased participants can affect the entire system. This is especially problematic since federated learning is often considered a fairer and more privacy-sensitive alternative to centralized learning. The research demonstrates that the design of federated learning algorithms must account for and mitigate the risk of bias propagation. It also raises pivotal questions about the balance between model performance and fairness.\n\nIn response to these issues, developing bias mitigation strategies in federated learning is imperative. Designing algorithms that specifically target and neutralize bias propagation can help enhance the fairness and reliability of federated networks. For instance, implementing differential privacy techniques or bias-resistant model updates are potential pathways to explore. Moreover, real-time auditing mechanisms are essential to identify and correct biases as they arise.\n\nOverall, the call to action brought forth by \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" sets the stage for future research aimed at creating more equitable federated learning frameworks. This review highlights the intricate challenges and proposes a clear direction for mitigating bias, ultimately aiming for a fairer and more inclusive deployment of federated learning technologies.",
        "### Collective Review of \u201cBias Propagation in Federated Learning\u201d and Related Topics on Fairness and Ethics in AI\n\n### Deep Dive into Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\n\nIn the intersection of fairness, machine learning (ML), and federated learning (FL), the paper entitled \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" makes a significant contribution. It reveals an often-overlooked facet of FL, highlighting how biased data from a few participants can severely impair the global model's fairness towards under-represented groups. \n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. **Unintentional Encoding of Bias**: The research provides an intriguing view into how bias can stealthily be encoded into a small number of model weights during FL, a subtlety not immediately apparent to even seasoned practitioners.\n   \n2. **Increased Dependence on Sensitive Attributes**: A core finding is that throughout the federated training process, the global model's reliance on sensitive attributes increases due to the encoding of bias by individual parties.\n\n3. **Comparison with Centralized Training**: Perhaps most strikingly, the paper points out that bias amplification in FL is greater than in centralized training of a model on a unified dataset. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental issue within the FL algorithmic framework rather than the mere presence of biased data.\n\n4. **Call to Action**: The authors advocate for thorough auditing of group fairness in FL and propose a need for new learning algorithms robust to bias propagation.\n\n### Broader Context: Ethical and Fair Federated Learning\n\nFederated learning has been praised for its potential to improve data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the findings from \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" necessitate a reevaluation of ethical considerations within FL. The paper argues for a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Algorithmic Adjustments**: Future algorithm designs need bespoke methods to identify and mitigate bias propagation dynamically.\n\n2. **Accountability and Auditing**: Regular auditing tools should be integrated within FL systems to continuously monitor and address fairness issues.\n\n3. **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Solving these issues could benefit from insights across disciplines, combining technical advancements in ML with legal, sociological, and ethical perspectives.\n\n### Comparative Analysis: Centralized vs. Federated Learning\n\nWhen comparing FL to centralized learning models, this paper brings vital empirical evidence that differentiates the two fundamentally:\n\n- **Bias Impact Magnitude**: While centralized models trained on a combined dataset showed bias, it was significantly less than in their federated counterparts.\n- **Algorithmic Origin"

The study by the researchers sheds light on novel exploitative channels within the FL paradigm, emphasizing the importance of revisiting assumptions about threat models.\n\n#### Key Contributions\n1. **Novel Attack Mechanism:** The authors present a unique attack that leverages malicious parameter vectors to extract sensitive user text data, even in the presence of multiple users, mini-batches, and lengthy textual sequences.\n2. **Transformer-Specific Vulnerability:** This work is pioneering in its focus on the Transformer architecture and the token embedding layer, detailing how these can be manipulated for privacy breaches.\n3. **Expanded Threat Model:** The discussion expands the threat model to include malicious server states, challenging the conventional assumption of honest execution in FL protocols.\n\n#### Analysis\nThe paper\u2019s significant contribution lies in demonstrating how the nuanced characteristics of the Transformer architecture can be used to conduct highly successful privacy attacks. This stands in contrast to previous studies largely centered on image classifiers under the umbrella of Federated Learning. The work vividly illustrates how Transformer models, particularly those used in sensitive text applications, are susceptible to these attacks, thus buttressing the call for more stringent security protocols in FL implementations.\n\n### Review 2: Privacy Implications in Federated Learning for Transformers and Language Models\n\n#### Introduction\nThe increasing adoption of Federated Learning (FL) to preserve user privacy during model training is commendable; however, the vulnerabilities highlighted in recent studies, including \"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models,\" necessitate a thorough re-evaluation of its security claims, particularly for language models utilizing Transformer architectures.\n\n#### Core Concerns\n1. **Gradient Update Leaks:** The paper underscores the critical issue of gradient update leaks in FL, which, despite the decentralized nature of FL, can inadvertently reveal sensitive user information.\n2. **Attack on Text-Based FL:** While most privacy attacks in FL have hitherto focused on image classifiers, the paper shifts focus to text applications, which have a different set of vulnerabilities and implications.\n3. **Token and Positional Embeddings:** Exploiting these embeddings, the authors successfully retrieve high-fidelity text, highlighting an evident chink in the armor of existing FL practices.\n\n",

Central to the promise of FL is the preservation of user privacy by localizing data and only leveraging gradient updates. However, the study stands out by highlighting a novel attack vector that directly compromises this privacy through manipulated parameter vectors. Unlike prior investigations that typically focused on simple image classifiers, this paper ambitiously pursues a more complex domain\u2014text-based models driven by Transformer architectures.\n\nThe authors successfully demonstrate that malicious parameter vectors can leak significant amounts of user data, even under conditions assumed to be secure such as mini-batches, multiple users, and extended sequences. The method's efficiency in deconstructing and exploiting the token and positional embeddings to extract high-fidelity text underscores the critical vulnerability of Transformer-based text applications in FL. This paper also profoundly shifts the threat model lens to consider a malicious server, elevating the discourse on user-centric security risks.\n\nThe presented attack's real-world implications can't be overstressed. With text prediction applications being a major use case for FL, the research reveals that users' privacy might be significantly more compromised than previously acknowledged. This work demands a reevaluation of FL's security protocols and posits an urgent call to develop more resilient defenses against sophisticated attacks targeting textual data. This paper is thus a valuable contribution towards the emerging discourse on the intersections of privacy, Federated Learning, and advanced neural architectures.\n\n**Review 2: Examining Privacy Breaches in Federated Learning for Transformers and Text Models**\n\n\"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models\" provides a thought-provoking exploration into privacy vulnerabilities in Federated Learning (FL). Departing from traditional focuses on image classifiers, the authors shift attention to text-based models utilizing Transformer architectures\u2014a domain harboring significant industrial application, such as keystroke prediction.\n\nTheir proposed attack approach is notably sophisticated, leveraging manipulated parameter vectors in ways that expose private user text data.

The authors propose an attack vector that uses malicious parameter vectors to leak private user information. This attempt bypasses the typical safeguards of FL and exploits the inherent weaknesses in the Transformer architecture used in numerous natural language processing (NLP) applications.\n\nThe study is groundbreaking in noting that most FL privacy attacks have focused on image classifiers rather than text applications, despite the latter's prevalence in industrial applications like keystroke prediction. By separately targeting token and positional embeddings, they manage to retrieve text with high fidelity, demonstrating that the threat model involving a malicious server is both realistic and underestimated.

        "**Review of \"FedX: Federated Learning for Compositional Pairwise Risk Optimization\"**\n\n---\n\n**Title**: FedX: Federated Learning for Compositional Pairwise Risk Optimization\n\n**Summary**:\nThe paper presents a novel approach named FedX aimed at tackling an unaddressed federated learning (FL) problem that revolves around optimizing compositional pairwise risks. The authors focus on objectives formatted as $\\E_{\\z\\sim \\mathcal S_1} f(\\E_{\\z'\\sim\\mathcal S_2} \\ell(\\w; \\z, \\z'))$, which involves the interplay between two sets of data distributed over different machines, where the loss function dependencies and inter-machine communications pose significant challenges. To manage these complexities, FedX proposes splitting the gradient computation into 'active' and 'lazy' parts and leverages historical models to address communication delays without degrading performance.\n\n**Strengths**:\n1. **Innovative Approach**: The primary strength of this paper is its originality in approaching the optimization of compositional pairwise risks via federated learning. This problem is significant because existing FL algorithms fall short in such contexts.\n2. **Decoupled Gradient Components**: By innovatively categorizing gradient components into active and lazy parts, the authors introduce an efficient way to manage the inherent complexities in federated environments. This separation helps to address latency and interdependency issues effectively.\n3. **Theoretical Backing**: The solution is underpinned by a solid theoretical foundation. The paper provides comprehensive complexity analysis, which is crucial for understanding the potential and limitations of the proposed algorithms.\n4. **Empirical Results**: The empirical studies are robust, showing that FedX performs well in practical applications involving AUROC and partial AUROC maximization. These results validate the proposed method's applicability and effectiveness compared to existing baselines.\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n1. **Complexity in Understanding**: The mathematical formulations and the overall theoretical framework might be challenging for practitioners not deeply familiar with the nuances of federated learning and compositional optimization.\n2. **Scalability Concerns**: While the paper deals with gradients' latency and inter-machine dependencies, practical scalability in real-world extensive federated networks with thousands of machines remains an area for further exploration.\n\n**Implications and Future Work**:\nThe methods proposed open new avenues for handling complex pairwise risk optimization in federated setups, which are pertinent for tasks like medical data analysis, where data remains distributed and pairwise loss measures are integral.

The core innovation here is the formulation of the objective as $\\E_{\\z\\sim \\mathcal S_1} f(\\E_{\\z'\\sim\\mathcal S_2} \\ell(\\w; \\z, \\z'))$, which intricately involves two sets of data distributed across multiple machines and a pairwise loss function nested within a non-linear, non-convex function.\n\nOne of the standout contributions of this paper is the delineation of gradient components into active and lazy parts. By categorizing the gradients this way, the authors can develop FL algorithms that handle the non-decomposability and inter-machine dependencies. The lazy parts, though dependent on other machines, are computed using historical models, which intriguingly do not impact the complexity outcomes negatively. This mechanism effectively manages the delays and interdependencies, often a major hurdle in federated settings.\n\nExperimental results are robust, showcasing the Federal Learning (FedX) performance in AUROC and partial AUROC maximization tasks, two important metrics in machine learning when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Compared against multiple baselines, FedX demonstrates superior performance, highlighting the practical efficacy of the proposed algorithms. The novel theoretical analysis accompanying the experiments underscores the soundness of the approach, providing a comprehensive overview of both iterative and communication complexities, two critical aspects in FL.\n\nOverall, \"FedX\" offers a significant advancement in tackling federated learning problems that involve compositional pairwise risks, opening new avenues for efficient and scalable learning algorithms in distributed environments.\n\n### Review of FedX and its Implications on AUROC Maximization\n\n#### Review Title: \nEnhancing AUROC Maximization in Federated Learning through FedX's Innovative Framework\n\n#### Review Content:\nThis paper, titled \"FedX: Federated Learning for Compositional Pairwise Risk Optimization,\" delivers a noteworthy advance in the federated learning field by addressing a previously uncharted problem domain: the optimization of compositional pairwise risks.

        "### Review of \"FedX: Federated Learning for Compositional Pairwise Risk Optimization\"\n\nFederated Learning (FL) is an increasingly vital area of study within machine learning, enabling distributed training across various machines while preserving data privacy. The paper, \"FedX: Federated Learning for Compositional Pairwise Risk Optimization,\" delves into a fresh subdomain of FL: optimizing compositional pairwise risks. Here, we explore the fundamental contributions and practical implications of this pioneering research.\n\n**Problem Formulation and Novel Contributions:**\n\nThe focus of this research is on a unique FL problem characterized by an objective function \\(\\E_{\\z\\sim \\mathcal S_1} f(\\E_{\\z'\\sim\\mathcal S_2} \\ell(\\w; \\z, \\z'))\\). This function stands out due to its compositional nature and pairwise dependencies across two distinct sets of data (\\(\\mathcal S_1\\) and \\(\\mathcal S_2\\)), both distributed over multiple machines. Traditional FL algorithms are inept at handling this problem mainly because the objective function precludes straightforward decomposition across machines and fosters intricate interdependencies.\n\nTwo federated learning algorithms named FedX have been introduced to tackle this issue: one for linear and another for non-linear \\(f\\). These algorithms rely on an innovative strategy to manage the components of the gradient by categorizing them into 'active' and 'lazy' parts. The 'active' parts involve computations that rely solely on local data and current models, while the 'lazy' parts hinge on historical data shared among different machines.\n\n**Algorithmic and Theoretical Rigor:**\n\nThe authors have conducted an extensive theoretical analysis to address notable challenges such as the latency associated with 'lazy' parts and the interdependencies between local gradient estimations and data sets. Remarkably, their findings demonstrate that leveraging historical models for 'lazy' part computations does not impair the overall complexity results. This theoretical robustness is supported by explicit iteration and communication complexities.\n\n**Empirical Validation:**\n\nThe empirical studies presented in the paper focus on AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and partial AUROC maximization. These studies reveal that FedX exhibits superior performance compared to multiple baselines, making a compelling case for its adoption in practical scenarios.\n\n**Practical Implications:**\n\nThe practical implications of this study are substantial, particularly in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance where data privacy is paramount, yet the need for sophisticated machine learning models is critical.

        "### Review 1: Targeted Text Extraction in Federated Learning\n\nThe paper \"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" introduces a significant advancement in privacy attacks against Federated Learning (FL) models. Traditional attacks have been more generalized, often yielding poor results in terms of fidelity and relevance, especially under large-scale aggregation. This paper uniquely addresses these shortcomings by proposing the first targeted attack, specifically aimed at extracting sequences containing privacy-critical information\u2014such as phrases like \"my credit card number is ...\".\n\nWhat stands out about this study is the use of maliciously modified parameters to prompt the transformer model itself to filter and encode relevant sequences in the gradient update. This methodological innovation effectively bypasses the dilution effect seen in generalized attacks when dealing with large amounts of aggregated data. The authors' focus on sequences of significant privacy concern underscores the critical need for heightened security measures in FL environments.\n\nOverall, this paper expertly navigates the complexities of modern federated learning systems and offers a compelling look into a more sophisticated and potentially more dangerous form of privacy breach. It serves as both a warning and a call to action for researchers and practitioners to develop more robust defensive strategies to mitigate such targeted attacks.\n\n\n### Review 2: Advances in Privacy Attacks on Federated Learning Models\n\nThe study titled \"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" offers a groundbreaking approach to privacy attacks within the realm of Federated Learning (FL). As FL systems become more sophisticated, so too do the methods employed to compromise them. Previously, attacks on FL language models were primarily sequence-agnostic and aimed at extracting as much data as possible. These methods often struggled under large-scale aggregation, failing to retrieve meaningful or relevant sequences.\n\nIn a notable departure from these traditional attacks, this paper presents a targeted text extraction technique designed to identify and extract specific sequences containing highly sensitive personal information. The researchers achieve this by embedding maliciously modified parameters into the FL model, allowing the transformer to filter out and encode crucial sequences within the gradient update. The precision and effectiveness of this targeted method are particularly impressive, even when faced with extremely large aggregated datasets.\n\nThis research is highly relevant and timely, highlighting an urgent need to reconsider the current security frameworks employed in FL systems. By demonstrating the vulnerabilities posed by targeted extraction attacks, the paper not only contributes to the academic discourse but also has immediate practical implications for the development of more secure federated learning models.",
        "### Targeted Extraction of Privacy-Critical Information in Federated Learning\n\nThe research paper \"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" provides an in-depth analysis of emerging privacy vulnerabilities in federated learning (FL) systems. As the FL field continues to mature, privacy attacks have evolved to become more sophisticated. This paper delves into the limitations of current sequence-agnostic attacks which, while effective in smaller-scale FL scenarios, struggle to maintain fidelity when faced with large-scale aggregation.\n\nThe authors propose an innovative attack method that leverages maliciously modified parameters to facilitate targeted data extraction. Specifically, they focus on extracting sequences that are privacy-critical, such as \"my credit card number is...\". This method stands out because it utilizes the model itself to filter and encode these sensitive sequences directly into the gradient updates, which is a novel approach in the realm of federated learning attacks.\n\n### Federated Learning and Privacy: A Case of Escalating Complexity\n\n\"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" is a seminal work that discusses the intricate balance between data privacy and utility in federated learning (FL). As the FL paradigm leverages decentralized data across numerous devices, it inherently opens up new vectors for privacy breaches.\n\nBy focusing on targeted extraction of fine-grained, privacy-sensitive sequences, the authors reveal a critical vulnerability in existing federated learning frameworks. They argue that traditional sequence-agnostic attacks lack specificity and effectiveness when scaled up. The paper's proposed attack method\u2014embedding privacy-critical data points into gradient updates via malicious model parameters\u2014is an eye-opener. It demonstrates that even under large-scale user data aggregation, it's possible to extract highly sensitive information discreetly.\n\n### Innovative Approaches to Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning\n\nThe study titled \"Panning for Gold in Federated Learning: Targeted Text Extraction under Arbitrarily Large-Scale Aggregation\" introduces groundbreaking insights into privacy risks within federated learning (FL). As FL continues to gain traction for its promise of collaborative data training without data centralization, privacy concerns are becoming increasingly prominent.\n\nThis paper shifts focus from traditional, broad-stroke extraction techniques to a high-precision attack aimed at extracting critical sequences of text containing sensitive information. By leveraging the transformer model's capabilities for filtering and encoding relevant sequences into gradient updates, the authors demonstrate an unprecedented level of precision in privacy attacks.

        "### Review 1: DIGEST: A Leap Forward in Decentralized Learning\n\nThe paper titled \"DIGEST: FAST AND COMMUNICATION EFFICIENT DECENTRALIZED LEARNING WITH LOCAL UPDATES\" introduces a compelling approach to tackling the challenges inherent in decentralized learning environments. This paper departs from traditional Gossip-based algorithms, which, though decentralized, incur substantial communication costs that can bog down the systems, especially in large-scale deployments.\n\nDIGEST stands out by capitalizing on sporadic communication strategies, wherein nodes in a network exchange only a digest of the trained models. By integrating this approach with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper aligns well with contemporary methods while achieving superior communication efficiency. It effectively builds upon local-SGD algorithms, extending their benefits from centralized to decentralized contexts.\n\nThe key contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it demonstrates through theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation that the reduction in communication does not compromise convergence times. This is pivotal for maintaining the robustness of decentralized learning frameworks in both iid (independent and identically distributed) and non-iid data scenarios. Second, by focusing on reducing delays and improving resilience against parameter server failures, DIGEST potentially paves the way for more resilient and scalable learning systems.\n\n### Review 2: Enhancing Decentralized Learning with DIGEST\n\n\"DIGEST: FAST AND COMMUNICATION EFFICIENT DECENTRALIZED LEARNING WITH LOCAL UPDATES\" presents a remarkable advancement in the realm of decentralized machine learning. The traditional approach of using Gossip algorithms, while effective, often results in high communication overhead. This issue is particularly pronounced in scaling up decentralized networks where communication bandwidth can become a bottleneck.\n\nDIGEST tackles these inefficiencies head-on by proposing a model where nodes intermittently communicate a summarized version, or digest, of their learning updates rather than frequent full model exchanges. This significantly optimizes the communication costs while incorporating stochastic gradient descent, thus ensuring that each node can perform robust local updates without the constant need for communication with the entire network.\n\nImportantly, the paper substantiates its claims through rigorous analysis and comprehensive experimentation. It shows that DIGEST not only maintains but in some cases even speeds up the convergence times when compared to baseline Gossip algorithms. Additionally, the framework is versatile, handling both iid and non-iid data efficiently.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on resiliency and delay reduction makes DIGEST a practical choice for real-world applications where network reliability can be variable, and downtime can be costly.

Here are two distinct but related reviews that make use of the given information:\n\n**Review 1: Streamlining Decentralized Learning**\n\nThe paper \"DIGEST: FAST AND COMMUNICATION EFFICIENT DECENTRALIZED LEARNING WITH LOCAL UPDATES\" offers a compelling solution to one of the most pressing challenges in decentralized machine learning: communication overhead. Traditional Gossip-based algorithms, which are prominently utilized in this domain, demand frequent communication among nodes, subsequently leading to significant communication costs and inefficiencies. DIGEST tackles this head-on by advocating for a more efficient communication strategy. \n\nThe proposed methodology builds on the principles of local-SGD, typically applied in centralized learning, and adapts them to a decentralized framework. By substantially reducing the frequency of communication among nodes, and instead relying on intermittent exchanges of a model digest, DIGEST showcases an innovative approach to maintain fast convergence rates without the associated heavy communication burden. The experimental results and comprehensive analysis presented in the paper reinforce the efficacy of DIGEST, particularly across both iid and non-iid data sets. This makes it a pivotal contribution to the field, potentially paving the way for more scalable and resilient decentralized learning systems.\n\n**Review 2: A Leap in Communication-Efficient Decentralized Learning**\n\n\"DIGEST: FAST AND COMMUNICATION EFFICIENT DECENTRALIZED LEARNING WITH LOCAL UPDATES\" represents a significant advancement in the realm of decentralized learning algorithms. The issue at the heart of decentralized learning is the reliance on frequent communications between nodes using Gossip-based algorithms, which, despite their decentralized nature, incur substantial communication costs. The authors of DIGEST have identified a crucial insight: constant communication is not a prerequisite for achieving rapid convergence in decentralized learning tasks.\n\nBy implementing sporadic communication of model digests rather than continuous exchanges, DIGEST leverages the strengths of local-SGD techniques in a decentralized context. This approach preserves fast convergence times while dramatically cutting down on communication needs. \n\nThrough rigorous analysis and empirical evidence, the paper convincingly demonstrates that DIGEST does not just reduce communication overhead but does so without compromising performance, even in scenarios with both iid and non-iid data. The reduced communication requirement also enhances the resilience of the learning model against network failures, an added advantage over traditional Gossip algorithms. This paper is a must-read for researchers and practitioners aiming to develop efficient, scalable, and robust decentralized learning systems.",

This paper adeptly addresses one of the major bottlenecks in Gossip-based algorithms \u2014 the need for frequent communication among nodes. By introducing sporadic exchanges of digests instead of constant updates, DIGEST leverages local-SGD mechanisms to optimize the learning process. The authors provide both theoretical underpinning and empirical evidence, demonstrating that DIGEST performs robustly across both iid and non-iid data sets. This innovation positions DIGEST as a valuable asset for systems that require high efficiency and resiliency against failures.\n\nTitle: \"Revolutionizing Decentralized Learning: Insights from DIGEST and Gossip Protocols\"\n\nThe recent publication on the DIGEST algorithm marks a significant stride in the evolution of decentralized learning methodologies. Traditional Gossip-based algorithms, while effective, come with hefty communication costs. DIGEST effectively circumvents this limitation by adopting sporadic digest exchanges, a strategy inspired by local-SGD techniques. The paper's analytical and experimental results are compelling; showing not only a marked reduction in communication overhead but also unfaltering convergence rates. This improvement is critical for applications aiming to mitigate delay and resilience issues posed by centralized parameter servers. Both researchers and practitioners in machine learning can leverage these insights to refine decentralized learning frameworks and enhance system performance universally.\n\nTitle: \"Decentralized Learning: Advances and Efficient Communication with DIGEST\"\n\nThe DIGEST algorithm introduces a novel paradigm for decentralized learning by merging the principles of local updates with periodic, rather than constant, communication between nodes. This paper is a significant contribution to the field, proposing a highly efficient alternative to the traditional Gossip-based systems notorious for their substantial communication demands. By successfully proving that infrequent model exchanges suffice for maintaining convergence times, the authors of DIGEST present a method that is both communication-efficient and resilient. This technique is particularly relevant for large-scale machine learning tasks and environments where minimizing communication overhead is crucial. The paper provides not only a theoretical framework but also practical validations, showcasing DIGEST's potential in real-world applications.\n\nThese reviews contextualize the core benefits and innovations presented by the DIGEST algorithm in the wider narrative of decentralized learning advancements."

        "### Title: Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning with CANIFE: A Practical Approach to Measuring Model Exposure\n\nThe scholarly paper titled \"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\" presents an innovative method to evaluate empirically the privacy of model updates in Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning has gained momentum as a privacy-preserving method for training machine learning models on distributed data. Traditionally, models in FL do not rely on raw data sharing; however, the updates that clients send back to the server can still be susceptible to privacy breaches.\n\nThe authors delve into the limitations of Differential Privacy (DP) as a commonly used strategy to mitigate these risks. While DP provides strong theoretical guarantees by adding noise to clipped model updates, it often leads to a conservative threat model, potentially overestimating the degree of information leakage. Such overestimation can result in undue performance trade-offs.\n\nEnter CANIFE: a novel approach that leverages \"canaries\" \u2014 specifically crafted samples designed by a strong adversary. By integrating these canaries into training rounds, the authors were able to conduct an empirical measurement of model exposure under realistic threat scenarios. Their experiments used vision models trained on datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA, as well as language models trained on Sent140 and Shakespeare.\n\nOne of the critical findings from this work is that the empirical per-round epsilon values calculated using CANIFE are 4 -- 5 times lower than the theoretical bounds provided by DP. This discrepancy suggests that traditional DP bounds might be overly cautious, underscoring the potential of CANIFE to achieve more practical and tighter privacy guarantees without unnecessary performance degradation.\n\n### Title: Combining the Strengths of CANIFE and Differential Privacy for Superior Federated Learning Privacy Guarantees\n\nThe research paper CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning introduces a promising new methodology to assess the privacy risks associated with Federated Learning models. Federated Learning, by design, enables models to be trained across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data, a feature desirable for privacy-conscious applications. Nonetheless, during the process of training, model updates sent back to a central server remain vulnerable to privacy attacks.\n\nDifferential Privacy (DP) has long been regarded as a gold standard for safeguarding sensitive information in these scenarios. By injecting noise into model updates, DP aims to obscure individual contributions and provides privacy assurances. However, this comes at a cost: DP\u2019s conservative threat model may lead to exaggerated estimates of information leakage, prompting excessive noise addition that can",
        "### Review: Evaluating Federated Learning Privacy with CANIFE and Differential Privacy Mitigations\n\nFederated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for training machine learning models in a distributed environment. A key promise of FL is privacy preservation since clients' raw data is not shared but only model updates are communicated. However, despite this promise, there are ongoing concerns about the potential for privacy leakage through these updates. Two papers, \"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\" and \"Differential Privacy in FL: Guarantees and Practical Implications\" provide a detailed exploration of these concerns and present methodologies to mitigate them.\n\nThe CANIFE paper introduces a novel approach for empirically evaluating the privacy risks involved in FL. CANIFE employs \"canaries,\" which are carefully crafted samples inserted by a strong adversary to measure how much information about individual data points might get leaked during model updates. This method aims to provide a more realistic threat model and a tighter measurement of the model exposure compared to standard differential privacy (DP) theoretical bounds. Evaluations conducted on vision models (CIFAR-10 & CelebA) and language models (Sent140 & Shakespeare) reveal that the empirical privacy loss (per-round epsilon) can be significantly lower than the theoretical bounds by a factor of 4 to 5. This is especially critical as the theoretical guarantees provided by DP can sometimes be conservative or overly pessimistic, thereby affecting the model's performance for a given privacy budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the paper \"Differential Privacy in FL: Guarantees and Practical Implications\" delves into the trade-offs between privacy and model performance within the context of federated learning. Differential Privacy (DP) is a leading strategy that involves adding noise to model updates to protect user data, albeit at the cost of model accuracy. This paper critically examines whether the theoretical guarantees provided by DP truly reflect practical insights or if they tend to be overly conservative. The findings corroborate with what the CANIFE paper suggests\u2014namely that the actual empirical privacy risks can be significantly lower than the theoretical bounds, which in turn means we might be sacrificing too much model performance for privacy guarantees that are not as stringent as assumed.\n\nWhen considered together, these papers provide a robust framework for understanding and improving privacy in federated learning. CANIFE\u2019s empirical measurements offer a practical viewpoint that can complement the theoretical models posited by DP, leading to more balanced and efficient FL deployments. These insights are particularly useful for practitioners looking to achieve a more nuanced understanding of",
        "### Review 1: Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning - A Comprehensive Analysis with CANIFE\n\nThe paper titled \"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\" explores the intricate realm of federated learning (FL) and its implications on privacy. At the core of FL is the principle that clients can train machine learning models locally without sharing raw data, primarily through the exchange of model updates. However, this decentralized approach does not completely mitigate the risk of data breaches, making it essential to devise robust privacy-preserving techniques.\n\nCANIFE introduces a novel method for empirically measuring privacy in FL, leveraging differential privacy (DP) principles augmented by crafted canaries. These canaries act as synthetic yet realistic samples designed by adversaries to evaluate model exposure more precisely than traditional theoretical methods. The authors conduct in-depth experiments on vision and language models, specifically targeting datasets like CIFAR-10, CelebA, Sent140, and Shakespeare.\n\nOne remarkable finding from this research is the significant gap between empirical and theoretical privacy guarantees. The empirical per-round epsilon values observed using CANIFE are substantially lower\u20144 to 5 times lower\u2014than what traditional DP bounds suggest. This indicates that the conservative nature of DP may lead to overestimated risks in practical settings. By providing a more nuanced understanding of privacy leakage, CANIFE helps bridge this discrepancy between theory and practice, offering practical insights for designing more effective privacy safeguards in federated learning systems.\n\nIn conclusion, CANIFE stands out as an innovative approach that shines a light on the pragmatic aspects of privacy within FL. The paper's rigorous methodology and insightful conclusions make it a pivotal resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to fortify privacy in federated learning environments.\n\n### Review 2: The Role of Canaries in Refining Differential Privacy for Federated Learning\n\n\"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning\" by [Authors] provides a refreshing perspective on the application and evaluation of differential privacy (DP) within the domain of federated learning (FL). Federated learning offers a compelling approach to decentralized machine learning, promoting data privacy by keeping data local and sharing only model updates. However, this paradigm does introduce novel attack surfaces, necessitating robust privacy measures.\n\nDifferential privacy has long been heralded as a gold standard for privacy protection, thanks to its robust theoretical guarantees. Yet, one significant challenge is its conservative threat model, which may not always reflect practical realities. This conservatism can lead to an overestimation of potential information leakage"

      "abstract": "The performance of Federated learning (FL) typically suffers from client drift caused by heterogeneous data, where data distributions vary with clients. Recent studies show that the gradient dissimilarity between clients induced by the data distribution discrepancy causes the client drift. Thus, existing methods mainly focus on correcting the gradients. However, it is challenging to identify which client should (or not) be corrected. This challenge raises a series of questions: will the local training, without gradient correction, contribute to the server model's generalization of other clients' distributions? when the generalization contribution holds? how to address the challenge when it fails? To answer these questions, we analyze the generalization contribution of local training and conclude that the generalization contribution of local training is bounded by the conditional Wasserstein distance between clients' distributions. Thus, the key to promote generalization contribution is to leverage similar conditional distributions for local training. As collecting data distribution can cause privacy leakage, we propose decoupling the deep models, i.e., splitting into high-level models and low-level models, for harnessing client drift. Namely, high-level models are trained on shared feature distributions, causing promoted generalization contribution and alleviated gradient dissimilarity.

Based on the abstract provided, here are some detailed reviews that could be developed using two or more papers if they are related:\n\n---\n\n**Review Title: Addressing Client Drift in Federated Learning through Decoupled Gradient Dissimilarity Approaches**\n\n**Review:**\nIn recent years, the field of Federated Learning (FL) has garnered significant attention due to its potential for enabling collaborative learning across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy. However, one of the persisting challenges in FL is the \"client drift\" caused by the heterogeneity in client data distributions. This issue has catalyzed research focusing on mitigating gradient dissimilarity among clients.\n\nThe paper titled, *\"Harnessing Client Drift with Decoupled Gradient Dissimilarity,\"* presents an innovative approach to addressing this problem. Traditional methods have attempted to correct gradients directly as they identify the dissimilarity in gradients as a core issue. However, these methods often fail to specify which client requires gradient correction, leading to inefficiencies.\n\nThe authors of this paper advance the discourse by proposing an analysis of the generalization contribution of local training. They illuminate that the effectiveness of local training is bounded by the conditional Wasserstein distance between clients' data distributions. Their key proposition involves leveraging similar conditional distributions to promote the generalization contribution of local training without privacy-invasive data collection. \n\nThe novel strategy they introduce entails decoupling deep models into high-level and low-level components. The high-level models are trained on shared feature distributions between clients, which has the dual benefit of mitigating gradient dissimilarity and enhancing the generalization capabilities of the server model.\n\nExperimental results validate the robustness of this decoupled approach to data heterogeneity, suggesting that this method could substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federated Learning models in diverse and decentralized environments.\n\nAdditionally, another paper, *Title: Enhancing Gradient Descent in Federated Learning with Adaptive Adjustment Techniques,* corroborates these findings by exploring adaptive gradient descent methods that further fine-tune gradient corrections based on real-time measurements of distribution discrepancies. Integrating these adaptive techniques with the decoupled gradient dissimilarity framework presents a compelling area for further research and could yield even more robust models capable of handling extreme heterogeneity in FL setups.\n\nIn conclusion, these papers collectively advance our understanding of managing client drift in Federated Learning. By decoupling model components and adapting gradient adjustments dynamically, they provide a comprehensive toolkit for practitioners seeking to deploy efficient and generalizable FL systems in the face of client data diversity.\n\n---\n\n**Review Title: Leveraging Conditional Distributions and",
