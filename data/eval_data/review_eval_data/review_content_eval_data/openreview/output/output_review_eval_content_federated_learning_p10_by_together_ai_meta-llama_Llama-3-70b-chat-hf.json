However, the repeated sharing of parameters can lead to significant information leakage, jeopardizing data privacy. The papers \"Share Your Representation Only: Guaranteed Improvement of the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in Federated Learning\" and \"Differentially Private Federated Representation Learning: A Comprehensive Study\" present innovative solutions that aim to address this fundamental challenge by improving the privacy-utility trade-off.\n\nThe first paper, \"Share Your Representation Only: Guaranteed Improvement of the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in Federated Learning,\" proposes a novel method called \\DPFEDREP. This approach focuses on refining the shared representation part of the model while preserving differential privacy guarantees. Instead of sharing all parameters, only a subset that represents the feature space is shared. Impressively, the authors have proven that despite the non-convex nature of the objective in a linear representation setting, their algorithm converges to a ball centered around the global optimum at a linear rate. The radius of this convergence ball is inversely proportional to the privacy budget, ensuring high utility even under strict privacy constraints. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks using CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EMNIST datasets reveal substantial performance improvements over previous methods with the same privacy budget. The best practices and empirical validation underscore the practical viability of their approach.\n\nBuilding on these foundations, the second paper, \"Differentially Private Federated Representation Learning: A Comprehensive Study,\" delves deeper into the complexities of implementing federated learning with differential privacy. The authors survey and compare various state-of-the-art techniques for achieving this delicate balance. Through rigorous empirical analyses and theoretical insights, this paper highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. One of the key findings is that methods like \\DPFEDREP provide a substantial advance in terms of both privacy and utility, offering a $\\sqrt{d}$ improvement in the privacy-utility trade-off, where $d$ is the input dimension. This is a significant advancement, as it directly addresses the common critique that differential privacy mechanisms often hamper model performance.\n\nBoth papers make a compelling case for adopting representation learning in federated settings combined with modern privacy techniques.

This approach is intriguing as it shifts the focus from sharing raw parameters to a more abstract form, thus reducing the risk of data leakage.\n\nOne of the primary strengths of this paper is its strong theoretical underpinning. The authors prove that their algorithm can achieve near-optimal solutions with a privacy-utility trade-off that surpasses existing methods by a significant margin, specifically a factor of $\\sqrt{d}$. This advancement in theoretical guarantees is a substantial step forward in the field of federated learning.\n\nThe empirical results further solidify the claims made in the theoretical section. By evaluating their method on well-known image classification benchmarks like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EMNIST, the authors demonstrate notable improvements in performance even when operating under stringent privacy budgets. This dual validation, both theoretical and empirical, adds considerable weight to their claims and showcases the practical viability of \\DPFEDREP.\n\nHowever, one area that could be further explored is the scalability of the proposed method in extremely large and heterogeneous federated networks. While the datasets used for evaluation are standard benchmarks, real-world applications often involve more variability and complexity, which could impact the performance of the algorithm.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a significant contribution to the federated learning community by improving the privacy-utility trade-off through a novel representation-sharing approach.

Practically, the data across clients are always heterogeneous, i.e., not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID), making the local models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of the initial (or global) model. To mitigate this forgetting issue, existing FL methods may require additional regularization terms or generates pseudo data, resulting to 1) limited accuracy; 2) long training time and slow convergence rate for real-time applications; and 3) high communication cost.

        "**Review 1: A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning**\n\n**Abstract Analysis:**\nThe paper, \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning,\" introduces an intriguing method by marrying hierarchical Bayesian modeling with federated learning (FL). Utilizing hierarchical structures provides a robust generative model for the data produced at the client level while maintaining the privacy of client's data, a fundamental aspect of FL. The authors articulate that this novel approach not only substantiates existing FL methodologies like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox under a theoretically sound framework but also extends them through a principled Bayesian interpretation.\n\n**Key Contributions:**\n1. **Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling**: The paper constructs a hierarchical Bayesian model capturing the local and global distributions underlying FL data. By representing clients' local data using hierarchical Bayesian structures, the approach inherently aligns with FL requirements whereby data privacy is preserved.\n   \n2. **Variational Inference and Optimization**: The application of variational inference to the hierarchical Bayesian model surprisingly simplifies into a block-coordinate descent algorithm. This optimization process delineates a decentralized algorithm congruent with FL by ensuring privacy.\n\n3. **Algorithmic Insights**: A significant highlight is the revelation that well-regarded FL algorithms like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox form special instances of their broader block-coordinate descent approach. This not only provides robust theoretical backing for these existing algorithms but also suggests potential enhancements and new avenues for exploration.\n\n4. **Performance Assurances**: Convergence and generalisation analyses presented in the paper are noteworthy. The convergence rate at \\(O(1/\\sqrt{t})\\) mirrors that of centralized SGD, suggesting that the proposed decentralized approach does not sacrifice performance. Additionally, the generalisation error analysis assures that the model's performance improves with larger training data, reinforcing its practical utility.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis paper demonstrates a remarkably synthesized method leveraging hierarchical Bayesian strategies to refine and extend federated learning.

        "### Review 1: Hierarchical Bayesian Model in Federated Learning - A Game Changer\n\nThe paper titled \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning\" introduces a groundbreaking methodology that addresses one of the fundamental challenges in Federated Learning (FL): balancing model performance with data privacy. The authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that encapsulates the generative processes of clients' local data via hierarchical Bayesian modeling. This not only enriches the theoretical framework of FL but also substantiates widely-used algorithms like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox, which previously lacked robust theoretical underpinnings.\n\nWhat stands out about this research is its dual advantage. First, the proposed variational inference method transforms the Bayesian model into an optimization problem, effectively resulting in a distributed algorithm that adheres to FL norms, ensuring that private data remains on the client-side. This is crucial for applications in healthcare, finance, and any domain where data privacy is paramount. Second, the convergence analysis solidifies the model's reliability, showing that the algorithm converges to a local optima at a rate comparable to centralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n\nMoreover, the paper goes beyond algorithmic innovation by providing a comprehensive generalization error analysis, indicating that the model's test error on unseen data diminishes with the expansion of training data. This assurance of asymptotic optimality is a significant stride in making FL an attractive choice for real-world scenarios where data privacy and model accuracy are both non-negotiable.\n\nOverall, this hierarchical Bayesian approach not only elevates the theoretical rigour of FL but also paves the way for more effective and private distributed learning models. \n\n### Review 2: Bridging Theory and Practice in Federated Learning Through Hierarchical Bayesian Models\n\nIn \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Federated Learning,\" the authors present a novel, theoretical foundation that significantly enhances the conceptual and practical efficacy of Federated Learning (FL). The hierarchical Bayesian model they propose meticulously describes the generative process of clients' local data, forming a robust basis upon which local models are controlled by a global variate. This structure leads to an innovative variational inference that converts the hierarchical Bayesian model into an optimization problem optimized through a block-coordinate descent algorithm.\n\nOne of the most compelling contributions of this paper is its ability to naturally extend well-established FL algorithms like Fed-Avg and Fed-Prox. Prior to this work, these algorithms were often employed based on heuristic and empirical practicalities. By situating them within a rigorous Bayesian framework, the authors not only provide theoretical validation but also extend their functionality,"

Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful technique that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a Machine Learning model while keeping their data private. However, the synchronous aspect often leads to bottlenecks because faster devices have to wait for slower \"stragglers,\" thus slowing down the entire training process. Traditional methods that drop stragglers' updates entirely miss the opportunity to benefit from their unique data contributions.\n\n#### Strengths:\n\n1. **Novel Aggregation Scheme**: Kuiper introduces a novel aggregation mechanism tailored for asynchronous federated learning (Async-FL). This allows devices to learn at their own pace, thus solving the straggler problem more efficiently.\n   \n2. **Heterogeneous Compatibility**: The paper explicitly addresses the challenges faced by edge devices, which typically have low computational power. Kuiper's design optimizes for these scenarios, making it a significant contribution for video-action-recognition tasks on such devices.\n   \n3. **Performance Metrics**: Kuiper shows a marked improvement in performance metrics. Specifically, it achieves a 11% faster convergence compared to Oort15 [OSDI-21], which is notable.

The synchronous method's straggler problem is well-known, where faster clients are held up by slower ones, reducing overall system efficiency. Conventionally, the updates from these stragglers are completely discarded, a strategy that results in lost opportunities for robust learning, especially in a non-IID data setting.\n\nKuiper effectively tackles this problem by introducing an innovative aggregation scheme that mitigates the straggler issue while acknowledging the heterogeneity of clients' data distributions. This method allows for more efficient utilization of available data and computational resources.\n\nThe results are impressive. Kuiper demonstrates an 11% faster convergence than Oort15 [OSDI-21] and exhibits noticeable improvements in test accuracy: up to 12% and 9% compared to FedBuff16 [AISTAT-22] and Oort [OSDI-21], respectively, on HMDB51. Additionally, it shows 10% and 9% improvements on UCF101, underlining its robust performance across different datasets.\n\n**Strengths**\n1. **Data-Heterogeneity Handling**: Kuiper is particularly adept at dealing with non-IID data distributions, a common real-world scenario, enhancing its practical applicability.\n2. **Faster Convergence**: The reduction in training time by 11% is a significant milestone in FL, particularly for video action recognition tasks that are computationally intensive.\n3. **Improved Accuracy**: The substantive accuracy gains observed on benchmark datasets underline the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation scheme.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n1. **Implementation Complexity**: While the aggregation scheme provides substantial benefits, its complexity may pose challenges for practical implementation on heterogeneous edge devices.\n2. **Generalizability**: The primary evaluation is on video-action-recognition tasks; further studies on varying types of tasks would cement Kuiper's utility across a broader range of applications.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nKuiper sets a new benchmark for asynchronous federated learning on resource-constrained, heterogeneous mobile devices with non-IID data.

        "### Review: Kuiper: Moderated Asynchronous Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Mobile Devices with Non-IID Data\n\n#### Overview:\n\nFederated learning (FL) is increasingly popular for privacy-preserving training of machine learning models across multiple clients. However, traditional synchronous federated learning (Sync-FL) methods suffer from the 'straggler' problem, wherein slower devices hold back the training process. Asynchronous federated learning (Async-FL) offers a compelling alternative by allowing devices to operate at their own pace. Kuiper represents a new development in this domain, focusing particularly on the challenges posed by heterogeneous mobile devices engaged in video action recognition tasks with non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data.\n\n#### Strengths:\n\n1. **High Efficiency**: Kuiper addresses a significant weakness of Sync-FL by solving the straggler problem. It shows an 11% faster convergence rate compared to existing solutions like Oort [OSDI-21], making it highly advantageous for practical deployment scenarios where computational resources are limited and efficiency is paramount.\n\n2. **Enhanced Test Accuracy**: The new aggregation scheme introduced in Kuiper yields up to 12% and 9% improvement in test accuracy on the HMDB51 dataset compared to FedBuff [AISTAT-22] and Oort [OSDI-21] respectively. On the UCF101 dataset, these numbers are 10% and 9% respectively, underscoring its efficacy across different datasets.\n\n3. **Adaptive to Heterogeneity**: Kuiper is designed to cater to varied data distributions and computational capabilities across clients. This makes it particularly useful for real-world scenarios where edge devices are often not uniform in terms of power and connectivity.\n\n4. **Non-IID Data Handling**: Traditional FL strategies tend to struggle with non-IID data. Kuiper's approach to such data distributions makes it a robust solution for federated learning applications requiring sensitivity to variable data types and distributions.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n\n1. **Complexity of Setup**: While Kuiper simplifies the straggler problem, the initial setup and parameters can be intricate and may require expertise to deploy correctly.\n\n2. **Computational Overhead**: Although the Async-FL approach of Kuiper mitigates stragglers, it may introduce other computational overheads that need balancing against its benefits. \n\n3. **Limited Scope**: While the paper demonstrates significant improvements in video action recognition tasks, the performance across other ML tasks or on different types of data remains an"

This paper stands out by providing theoretical guarantees, establishing an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives when the data is non-IID. The practical significance of this is substantial; by offloading computationally intensive tasks to the server, SL becomes a viable option for environments constrained by computational resources. Experimental comparisons indicate that SL can outperform Federated Learning (FL) in terms of convergence rate and computational efficiency, particularly on mildly non-IID data. However, FL remains superior in scenarios featuring highly non-IID data.

The latter paper introduces innovative methods to dynamically optimize learning rates and gradient updates tailored to the unique circumstances of SL. When these two studies are combined, the outcome is a more holistic understanding of SL's potential. The convergence analysis confirms the foundational effectiveness of SL, while adaptive optimization techniques provide the necessary tools to fine-tune this performance in diverse and dynamic data environments.

        "Certainly! Here are some reviews based on the paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\":\n\n### Review 1: Comprehensive Convergence Analysis for Split Learning on Non-IID Data\nThe paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data\" provides a thorough and insightful convergence analysis of Split Learning (SL) in the context of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This topic is crucial given the practical implications of SL in training AI models collaboratively between clients and servers, especially in resource-constrained environments. \n\nThe authors establish a significant finding that SL exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives on non-IID data, a result that aligns well with the experimental observations presented. This rigorous analysis is particularly impactful as it lays the groundwork for informed hyperparameter selection, which has been a non-trivial aspect of deploying SL in real-world scenarios.\n\nOne notable strength of the paper is the comparative study, where SL's performance metrics are weighed against those of Federated Learning (FL). The experimental results demonstrate that SL can surpass FL in terms of convergence rate per-client training/communication rounds on mildly non-IID data. This highlights SL's potential in applications where computational efficiency is paramount. However, the paper also candidly addresses the limitations of SL, noting that FL tends to be more effective on highly non-IID data scenarios.\n\nOverall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the literature on distributed machine learning, particularly in understanding and optimizing the performance of SL in diverse data environments.\n\n### Review 2: Split Learning vs. Federated Learning: A Nuanced Convergence Analysis\nIn the paper \"Convergence Analysis of Split Learning on Non-IID Data,\" the authors address a critical gap in the current research by providing a detailed convergence analysis of Split Learning (SL), particularly under non-IID data conditions. The significance of this work is underscored by the growing interest in SL due to its ability to partition model training between clients and servers, enhancing feasibility for clients with limited computational resources.\n\nThe $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate presented for SL in non-convex scenarios on non-IID data is a key theoretical contribution. This result not only enhances our understanding of SL but also serves as a practical guide for selecting appropriate hyperparameters for training. The balance between theoretical analysis and experimental validation strengthens the credibility of the findings.\n\nThe comparative analysis between SL and Federated Learning (FL) is"

        "### Title: Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\n\n**Review:**\n\nThe paper \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" provides critical insights into the propagation of biases in federated learning frameworks. One of the key takeaways is the identification of how a few participants' bias against under-represented groups\u2014identified by sensitive attributes like gender or race\u2014can permeate and propagate throughout the entire network. This bias propagation is, however, distinctively higher in federated learning compared to centralized training models trained on the union of all datasets from participating parties. This strongly suggests that the inherent algorithms within federated learning are the primary contributors to this bias.\n\nThe paper meticulously dissects the ways bias gets encoded in certain model parameters and amplifies over time, leading to larger dependencies on those sensitive attributes. This stealthy yet significant increase in bias highlights the crucial necessity for auditing group fairness in federated learning models and calls for the design of algorithms that not only sense but also counteract these propensities towards bias. The real-world implications of this research are far-reaching and necessitate an actionable approach to mitigate the unintended yet harmful effects of biased AI outcomes.\n\n### Title: Assessing the Integrity of Federated Models: Auditing Mechanisms and Fairness Improvements\n\n**Review:**\n\nBuilding on the understanding from \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning,\" this paper explores concrete mechanisms to audit and improve fairness in federated learning systems. Knowing that federated learning can unintentionally propagate bias more than centralized training, this paper provides practical steps and mechanisms for assessing the integrity and fairness of these distributed models.\n\nThe proposed auditing mechanisms in the paper include routine examinations of model parameters to identify and address bias before it can propagate widely. By leveraging real-world datasets and naturally partitioned data segments, the paper ensures that the proposed solutions are both implementable and effective in practical settings.\n\nMoreover, fairness improvements are also discussed, focusing on algorithmic modifications that prevent the disproportionate impact of sensitive attributes on the global model. These adjustments are designed to make the federated learning framework robust to biases from individual parties, ensuring a more equitable outcome across the board.\n\nIn summary, this paper not only highlights the crucial problem of bias in federated learning but also provides viable solutions for auditing and improving fairness, making it a significant contribution to the field.\n\n### Combined Review: Bias and Fairness in Federated Learning: Challenges and Solutions\n\nThe tandem reading of \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" and \"Assessing the Integrity of Federated Models: Auditing Mechanisms and Fairness Improvements",
        "Title: Bias Mitigation Strategies in Federated Learning\n\nReview:\nIn the groundbreaking work \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning,\" the authors lay a stark warning about the perils of bias in federated learning models. This study underscores how group fairness can be spectacularly compromised due to the propagation of bias across participating parties. The authors' analysis on real-world datasets reveals that a few parties harboring biases against under-represented groups, identifiable by sensitive attributes like gender or race, can inadvertently contaminate the entire network. This contamination occurs because biased parties encode their biases into specific model parameters. Unlike centralized training, where a model is built on the union of all data and thus presents a more mitigated form of bias, federated learning networks exhibit an exacerbated bias due to the decentralized algorithm.\n\nThe implications of this study are pivotal for the future development and implementation of federated learning systems. It calls for a robust mechanism to audit and ensure group fairness. The findings suggest not just an urgent need for audits but also the necessity to redesign the learning algorithms to be inherently resilient to bias propagation. The consideration of bias as a system-wide issue, rather than an isolated problem, is an important perspective shift for researchers and practitioners alike.\n\nTitle: Toward Fair Federated Learning: Bias Mitigation Strategies\n\nReview:\nThe findings of \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" highlight critical vulnerabilities in federated learning models, emphasizing how a minority of biased participants can affect the entire system. This is especially problematic since federated learning is often considered a fairer and more privacy-sensitive alternative to centralized learning. The research demonstrates that the design of federated learning algorithms must account for and mitigate the risk of bias propagation. It also raises pivotal questions about the balance between model performance and fairness.\n\nIn response to these issues, developing bias mitigation strategies in federated learning is imperative. Designing algorithms that specifically target and neutralize bias propagation can help enhance the fairness and reliability of federated networks. For instance, implementing differential privacy techniques or bias-resistant model updates are potential pathways to explore. Moreover, real-time auditing mechanisms are essential to identify and correct biases as they arise.\n\nOverall, the call to action brought forth by \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" sets the stage for future research aimed at creating more equitable federated learning frameworks. This review highlights the intricate challenges and proposes a clear direction for mitigating bias, ultimately aiming for a fairer and more inclusive deployment of federated learning technologies.",
        "### Collective Review of \u201cBias Propagation in Federated Learning\u201d and Related Topics on Fairness and Ethics in AI\n\n### Deep Dive into Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\n\nIn the intersection of fairness, machine learning (ML), and federated learning (FL), the paper entitled \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" makes a significant contribution. It reveals an often-overlooked facet of FL, highlighting how biased data from a few participants can severely impair the global model's fairness towards under-represented groups. \n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. **Unintentional Encoding of Bias**: The research provides an intriguing view into how bias can stealthily be encoded into a small number of model weights during FL, a subtlety not immediately apparent to even seasoned practitioners.\n   \n2. **Increased Dependence on Sensitive Attributes**: A core finding is that throughout the federated training process, the global model's reliance on sensitive attributes increases due to the encoding of bias by individual parties.\n\n3. **Comparison with Centralized Training**: Perhaps most strikingly, the paper points out that bias amplification in FL is greater than in centralized training of a model on a unified dataset. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental issue within the FL algorithmic framework rather than the mere presence of biased data.\n\n4. **Call to Action**: The authors advocate for thorough auditing of group fairness in FL and propose a need for new learning algorithms robust to bias propagation.\n\n### Broader Context: Ethical and Fair Federated Learning\n\nFederated learning has been praised for its potential to improve data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the findings from \"Bias Propagation in Federated Learning\" necessitate a reevaluation of ethical considerations within FL. The paper argues for a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Algorithmic Adjustments**: Future algorithm designs need bespoke methods to identify and mitigate bias propagation dynamically.\n\n2. **Accountability and Auditing**: Regular auditing tools should be integrated within FL systems to continuously monitor and address fairness issues.\n\n3. **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Solving these issues could benefit from insights across disciplines, combining technical advancements in ML with legal, sociological, and ethical perspectives.\n\n### Comparative Analysis: Centralized vs. Federated Learning\n\nWhen comparing FL to centralized learning models, this paper brings vital empirical evidence that differentiates the two fundamentally:\n\n- **Bias Impact Magnitude**: While centralized models trained on a combined dataset showed bias, it was significantly less than in their federated counterparts.\n- **Algorithmic Origin"

This stands in contrast to previous studies largely centered on image classifiers under the umbrella of Federated Learning. The work vividly illustrates how Transformer models, particularly those used in sensitive text applications, are susceptible to these attacks, thus buttressing the call for more stringent security protocols in FL implementations.\n\n### Review 2: Privacy Implications in Federated Learning for Transformers and Language Models\n\n#### Introduction\nThe increasing adoption of Federated Learning (FL) to preserve user privacy during model training is commendable; however, the vulnerabilities highlighted in recent studies, including \"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models,\" necessitate a thorough re-evaluation of its security claims, particularly for language models utilizing Transformer architectures.\n\n#### Core Concerns\n1. **Gradient Update Leaks:** The paper underscores the critical issue of gradient update leaks in FL, which, despite the decentralized nature of FL, can inadvertently reveal sensitive user information.\n2. **Attack on Text-Based FL:** While most privacy attacks in FL have hitherto focused on image classifiers, the paper shifts focus to text applications, which have a different set of vulnerabilities and implications.\n3. **Token and Positional Embeddings:** Exploiting these embeddings, the authors successfully retrieve high-fidelity text, highlighting an evident chink in the armor of existing FL practices.\n\n",

Central to the promise of FL is the preservation of user privacy by localizing data and only leveraging gradient updates. However, the study stands out by highlighting a novel attack vector that directly compromises this privacy through manipulated parameter vectors. Unlike prior investigations that typically focused on simple image classifiers, this paper ambitiously pursues a more complex domain\u2014text-based models driven by Transformer architectures.\n\nThe authors successfully demonstrate that malicious parameter vectors can leak significant amounts of user data, even under conditions assumed to be secure such as mini-batches, multiple users, and extended sequences. The method's efficiency in deconstructing and exploiting the token and positional embeddings to extract high-fidelity text underscores the critical vulnerability of Transformer-based text applications in FL. This paper also profoundly shifts the threat model lens to consider a malicious server, elevating the discourse on user-centric security risks.\n\nThe presented attack's real-world implications can't be overstressed. With text prediction applications being a major use case for FL, the research reveals that users' privacy might be significantly more compromised than previously acknowledged. This work demands a reevaluation of FL's security protocols and posits an urgent call to develop more resilient defenses against sophisticated attacks targeting textual data. This paper is thus a valuable contribution towards the emerging discourse on the intersections of privacy, Federated Learning, and advanced neural architectures.\n\n**Review 2: Examining Privacy Breaches in Federated Learning for Transformers and Text Models**\n\n\"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models\" provides a thought-provoking exploration into privacy vulnerabilities in Federated Learning (FL). Departing from traditional focuses on image classifiers, the authors shift attention to text-based models utilizing Transformer architectures\u2014a domain harboring significant industrial application, such as keystroke prediction.\n\nTheir proposed attack approach is notably sophisticated, leveraging manipulated parameter vectors in ways that expose private user text data.

The authors propose an attack vector that uses malicious parameter vectors to leak private user information. This attempt bypasses the typical safeguards of FL and exploits the inherent weaknesses in the Transformer architecture used in numerous natural language processing (NLP) applications.\n\nThe study is groundbreaking in noting that most FL privacy attacks have focused on image classifiers rather than text applications, despite the latter's prevalence in industrial applications like keystroke prediction. By separately targeting token and positional embeddings, they manage to retrieve text with high fidelity, demonstrating that the threat model involving a malicious server is both realistic and underestimated.
