This paper explores four key concepts in the context of large-scale spatio-temporal data analytics, including temporal-aware data compression, in-database machine learning with graph neural networks, adaptive NUMA-aware scheduling for massively parallel processing, and explainable AI for spatio-temporal graph neural networks. First, we introduce a novel temporal-aware compression technique that leverages temporal locality and patterns in large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, leading to more efficient storage and faster query processing. Second, we investigate the integration of graph neural networks within database management systems to enable in-database machine learning for graph-structured data, reducing data movement and improving performance. Third, we present adaptive NUMA-aware scheduling strategies for massively parallel processing systems, enabling dynamic resource allocation based on workload characteristics and NUMA architecture properties for better performance and scalability. Fourth, we focus on developing explainable AI techniques for spatio-temporal graph neural networks, providing insights into the decision-making process and improving trustworthiness and interpretability for complex urban and environmental management problems. External data from related papers highlight the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the creation of scenario-based ontology and the introduction of a new task, Zero-Shot 3D Reasoning Segmentation, for parts searching and localization for objects. Additionally, we discuss Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks , a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters, overcoming limitations of traditional MPGNNs.

Recent advancements in machine learning have propelled the development of sophisticated models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and manifold learning techniques. This paper explores Hybrid Manifold-RBM Models, which merge the strengths of RBMs with manifold learning to capture complex, multi-manifold distributions in high-dimensional data. This hybrid approach significantly enhances the representational power of RBMs, especially for tasks like image recognition where data often reside on multiple manifolds. Furthermore, we introduce Topological Regularization for RBMs, employing constraints based on the geometry of probability polytopes to preserve topological features of the data distribution. We demonstrate that incorporating topological constraints enables RBMs to learn more robust, interpretable, and topologically consistent representations. By integrating manifold learning techniques and topological regularization, our unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance in various benchmarks, underscoring the potential of these innovations in advancing the field of machine learning. Combining these complementary strategies addresses existing limitations in RBMs and sets a new standard for efficient and robust high-dimensional data modeling.

In this study, we propose a novel integration of enhanced privacy mechanisms and robust neural network verification methods to address critical challenges in modern distributed artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Leveraging cross-domain privacy mechanisms, we explore hybrid privacy-preserving techniques that combine local differential privacy and secure multi-party computation to provide robust privacy guarantees in multi-tenant systems like federated learning. Our approach introduces adaptive privacy mechanisms that dynamically adjust privacy budgets based on real-time data sensitivity and user-defined preferences, optimizing both privacy and utility. Simultaneously, we develop an advanced ensemble-based verification framework for neural networks, amalgamating multiple verification methods such as Branch-and-Bound (BaB) and satisfiability modulo theories. This integrative approach aims to enhance resilience and comprehensiveness, supporting various neural network architectures and activation functions. We further design a lightweight, embedded real-time verification component, ensuring continuous trustworthiness of deployed AI systems.\n\nOur comprehensive evaluation across benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed methods significantly bolster the robustness and reliability of federated learning models while preserving stringent privacy and verification standards. This dual-focus strategy not only addresses privacy and trustworthiness simultaneously but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to evolving AI and data-sharing ecosystems. The insights garnered from this work contribute valuable advancements to the fields of privacy-preserving machine learning and neural network verification, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in overcoming contemporary AI challenges.
