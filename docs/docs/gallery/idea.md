### Generated Ideas
#### NLP Field
```
Temporal-aware data compression for large-scale spatio-temporal datasets:
  Developing novel temporal-aware compression techniques that can take advantage of the temporal locality and patterns in large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, resulting in more efficient storage and faster query processing.
```
#### GNN Field
```
In-database machine learning with graph neural networks:
  Exploring the integration of graph neural networks within database management systems to enable in-database machine learning for graph-structured data, reducing data movement, and improving performance.
```
#### Federated Learning Field
```
Adaptive NUMA-aware scheduling for massively parallel processing:
  Investigating adaptive NUMA-aware scheduling strategies for massively parallel processing systems, enabling dynamic allocation of resources based on workload characteristics and NUMA architecture properties for better performance and scalability.
