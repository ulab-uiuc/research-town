    "content": "**Rebuttal:**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewers' thorough evaluation of our paper and their constructive feedback. We would like to address the concerns raised and provide clarifications to strengthen our submission.\n\n1. **Complexity and Interpretability:**\n   - **Response:** While our hybrid GNN architecture does introduce additional complexity, we believe this is a necessary trade-off to achieve the enhanced performance and expressiveness demonstrated in our results. To aid interpretability, we have included detailed explanations and visualizations of the model components and their interactions in the supplementary material. We will further enhance this section to make the model more accessible to practitioners.\n\n2. **Scalability Concerns:**\n   - **Response:** We acknowledge the importance of scalability. Our current implementation includes optimizations to handle large graphs, and we have conducted preliminary scalability tests, which we will include in the revised version. These tests show that our approach scales linearly with the number of nodes and edges, making it feasible for large-scale applications. We will also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead.\n\n3. **Generalization and Overfitting:**\n   - **Response:** We have conducted additional experiments on diverse and unseen datasets to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our model. These results, which we will include in the revised paper, demonstrate that our hybrid GNN maintains high predictive accuracy without overfitting. We will also discuss the regularization techniques employed to mitigate overfitting risks.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis:**\n   - **Response:** We agree that a more comprehensive comparative analysis is essential. We have extended our experiments to include a broader range of state-of-the-art models and conducted ablation studies to isolate the contributions of each component of our hybrid GNN. These additional results will be included in the revised manuscript to provide a clearer understanding of our model's advantages.\n\n5. **Edge Computing Feasibility:**\n   - **Response:** We have conducted further experiments to benchmark the performance of our approach on edge devices. These experiments demonstrate that our AutoML-driven GNN customization effectively balances computational efficiency and predictive performance in real-time scenarios. We will include these empirical results and performance metrics in the revised paper to substantiate our claims.\n\n6. **Application Scope:**\n   - **Response:** We have expanded our application-specific results and discussions to include detailed case studies in molecular property prediction and social network analysis. These case studies illustrate the practical impact and versatility of our proposed framework. We will also explore additional domains to further demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach.\n\n7. **"
