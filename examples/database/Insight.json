My recent work explores the intricate relationships between optimization algorithms and the generalization capabilities of neural networks, particularly focusing on the implicit biases introduced by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). I have investigated how label noise SGD can lead to simpler models by converging to low-rank features, bridging the gap between model simplicity and optimization dynamics.\n\nMy research also delves into the expressivity and learnability of Transformers, demonstrating their ability to simulate multi-step algorithms like gradient descent. I have developed novel sharpness measures to enhance optimization in overparameterized models, contributing to the understanding of how flatness regularization can improve generalization.\n\nIn the realm of graph machine learning, I have introduced innovative sampling theories and algorithms that address the challenges of large-scale graph representation. My work on Recursive Neighborhood Pooling GNNs (RNP-GNNs) quantifies the power of recursion in graph representation, while my studies on graph neural networks (GNNs) explore their generalization capabilities across different graph structures.\n\nAdditionally, I have contributed to the field of self-supervised learning, proposing methods that enforce geometric structures in embedding spaces to improve performance on downstream tasks. My research aims to provide theoretical insights and practical solutions that enhance the robustness and efficiency of machine learning models across various domains.\n\nHere are some recent papers:\n1th paper: We present RelBench, a public benchmark for solving predictive tasks over relational databases with graph neural networks. RelBench provides databases and tasks spanning diverse domains and scales, and is intended to be a foundational infrastructure for future research. We use RelBench to conduct the first comprehensive study of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) (Fey et al., 2024), which combines graph neural network predictive models with (deep) tabular models that extract initial entity-level representations from raw tables. End-to-end learned RDL models fully exploit the predictive signal encoded in primary-foreign key links, marking a significant shift away from the dominant paradigm of manual feature engineering combined with tabular models. To thoroughly evaluate RDL against this prior gold-standard, we conduct an in-depth user study where an experienced data scientist manually engineers features for each task. In this study, RDL learns better models whilst reducing human work needed by more than an order of magnitude. This demonstrates the power of deep learning for solving predictive tasks over relational databases, opening up many new research opportunities enabled by RelBench.\n2th paper: Much of the world's most valued data is stored in relational databases and data warehouses, where the data is organized into many tables connected by primary-foreign key relations. However, building machine learning models using this data is both challenging and time consuming. The core problem is that no machine learning method is capable of learning on multiple tables interconnected by primary-foreign key relations. Current methods can only learn from a single table, so the data must first be manually joined and aggregated into a single training table, the process known as feature engineering. Feature engineering is slow, error prone and leads to suboptimal models. Here we introduce an end-to-end deep representation learning approach to directly learn on data laid out across multiple tables. We name our approach Relational Deep Learning (RDL). The core idea is to view relational databases as a temporal, heterogeneous graph, with a node for each row in each table, and edges specified by primary-foreign key links. Message Passing Graph Neural Networks can then automatically learn across the graph to extract representations that leverage all input data, without any manual feature engineering. Relational Deep Learning leads to more accurate models that can be built much faster. To facilitate research in this area, we develop RelBench, a set of benchmark datasets and an implementation of Relational Deep Learning. The data covers a wide spectrum, from discussions on Stack Exchange to book reviews on the Amazon Product Catalog. Overall, we define a new research area that generalizes graph machine learning and broadens its applicability to a wide set of AI use cases.\n3th paper: Refactoring is one of the most important activities in software engineering which is used to improve the quality of a software system. With the advancement of deep learning techniques, researchers are attempting to apply deep learning techniques to software refactoring. Consequently, dozens of deep learning-based refactoring approaches have been proposed. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on such works as well as a taxonomy for deep learning-based refactoring. To this end, in this paper, we present a survey on deep learning-based software refactoring. We classify related works into five categories according to the major tasks they cover. Among these categories, we further present key aspects (i.e., code smell types, refactoring types, training strategies, and evaluation) to give insight into the details of the technologies that have supported refactoring through deep learning. The classification indicates that there is an imbalance in the adoption of deep learning techniques for the process of refactoring. Most of the deep learning techniques have been used for the detection of code smells and the recommendation of refactoring solutions as found in 56.25\\% and 33.33\\% of the literature respectively. In contrast, only 6.25\\% and 4.17\\% were towards the end-to-end code transformation as refactoring and the mining of refactorings, respectively. Notably, we found no literature representation for the quality assurance for refactoring. We also observe that most of the deep learning techniques have been used to support refactoring processes occurring at the method level whereas classes and variables attracted minimal attention. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with the employment of deep learning-based refactorings and present some potential research opportunities for future work.\n4th paper: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with residual links (ResNets) and causal dilated convolutional units have been the network of choice for deep learning approaches to speech enhancement. While residual links improve gradient flow during training, feature diminution of shallow layer outputs can occur due to repetitive summations with deeper layer outputs. One strategy to improve feature re-usage is to fuse both ResNets and densely connected CNNs (DenseNets). DenseNets, however, over-allocate parameters for feature re-usage. Motivated by this, we propose the residual-dense lattice network (RDL-Net), which is a new CNN for speech enhancement that employs both residual and dense aggregations without over-allocating parameters for feature re-usage. This is managed through the topology of the RDL blocks, which limit the number of outputs used for dense aggregations. Our extensive experimental investigation shows that RDL-Nets are able to achieve a higher speech enhancement performance than CNNs that employ residual and/or dense aggregations. RDL-Nets also use substantially fewer parameters and have a lower computational requirement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RDL-Nets outperform many state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to speech enhancement.\n5th paper: Contextual Relation Extraction (CRE) is mainly used for constructing a knowledge graph with a help of ontology. It performs various tasks such as semantic search, query answering, and textual entailment. Relation extraction identifies the entities from raw texts and the relations among them. An efficient and accurate CRE system is essential for creating domain knowledge in the biomedical industry. Existing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are not suitable to predict complex relations from sentences that consist of more than two relations and unspecified entities efficiently. In this work, deep learning techniques have been used to identify the appropriate semantic relation based on the context from multiple sentences. Even though various machine learning models have been used for relation extraction, they provide better results only for binary relations, i.e., relations occurred exactly between the two entities in a sentence. Machine learning models are not suited for complex sentences that consist of the words that have various meanings. To address these issues, hybrid deep learning models have been used to extract the relations from complex sentence effectively. This paper explores the analysis of various deep learning models that are used for relation extraction.\n\n\nPlease begin writing research insights that you can gain based on your research experience and the academic context.

In this work, deep learning techniques have been used to identify the appropriate semantic relation based on the context from multiple sentences. Even though various machine learning models have been used for relation extraction, they provide better results only for binary relations, i.e., relations occurred exactly between the two entities in a sentence. Machine learning models are not suited for complex sentences that consist of the words that have various meanings. To address these issues, hybrid deep learning models have been used to extract the relations from complex sentence effectively. This paper explores the analysis of various deep learning models that are used for relation extraction.\n\n\nPlease begin writing research insights that you can gain based on your research experience and the academic context.

RelBench provides databases and tasks spanning diverse domains and scales, and is intended to be a foundational infrastructure for future research. We use RelBench to conduct the first comprehensive study of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) (Fey et al., 2024), which combines graph neural network predictive models with (deep) tabular models that extract initial entity-level representations from raw tables. End-to-end learned RDL models fully exploit the predictive signal encoded in primary-foreign key links, marking a significant shift away from the dominant paradigm of manual feature engineering combined with tabular models. To thoroughly evaluate RDL against this prior gold-standard, we conduct an in-depth user study where an experienced data scientist manually engineers features for each task. In this study, RDL learns better models whilst reducing human work needed by more than an order of magnitude. This demonstrates the power of deep learning for solving predictive tasks over relational databases, opening up many new research opportunities enabled by RelBench.\n2th paper: Much of the world's most valued data is stored in relational databases and data warehouses, where the data is organized into many tables connected by primary-foreign key relations.

With the advancement of deep learning techniques, researchers are attempting to apply deep learning techniques to software refactoring. Consequently, dozens of deep learning-based refactoring approaches have been proposed. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on such works as well as a taxonomy for deep learning-based refactoring. To this end, in this paper, we present a survey on deep learning-based software refactoring. We classify related works into five categories according to the major tasks they cover. Among these categories, we further present key aspects (i.e., code smell types, refactoring types, training strategies, and evaluation) to give insight into the details of the technologies that have supported refactoring through deep learning. The classification indicates that there is an imbalance in the adoption of deep learning techniques for the process of refactoring. Most of the deep learning techniques have been used for the detection of code smells and the recommendation of refactoring solutions as found in 56.25\\% and 33.33\\% of the literature respectively. In contrast, only 6.25\\% and 4.17\\% were towards the end-to-end code transformation as refactoring and the mining of refactorings, respectively. Notably, we found no literature representation for the quality assurance for refactoring. We also observe that most of the deep learning techniques have been used to support refactoring processes occurring at the method level whereas classes and variables attracted minimal attention. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with the employment of deep learning-based refactorings and present some potential research opportunities for future work.\n4th paper: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with residual links (ResNets) and causal dilated convolutional units have been the network of choice for deep learning approaches to speech enhancement. While residual links improve gradient flow during training, feature diminution of shallow layer outputs can occur due to repetitive summations with deeper layer outputs. One strategy to improve feature re-usage is to fuse both ResNets and densely connected CNNs (DenseNets). DenseNets, however, over-allocate parameters for feature re-usage. Motivated by this, we propose the residual-dense lattice network (RDL-Net), which is a new CNN for speech enhancement that employs both residual and dense aggregations without over-allocating parameters for feature re-usage. This is managed through the topology of the RDL blocks, which limit the number of outputs used for dense aggregations. Our extensive experimental investigation shows that RDL-Nets are able to achieve a higher speech enhancement performance than CNNs that employ residual and/or dense aggregations. RDL-Nets also use substantially fewer parameters and have a lower computational requirement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RDL-Nets outperform many state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to speech enhancement.\n5th paper: Contextual Relation Extraction (CRE) is mainly used for constructing a knowledge graph with a help of ontology. It performs various tasks such as semantic search, query answering, and textual entailment. Relation extraction identifies the entities from raw texts and the relations among them. An efficient and accurate CRE system is essential for creating domain knowledge in the biomedical industry. Existing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are not suitable to predict complex relations from sentences that consist of more than two relations and unspecified entities efficiently. In this work, deep learning techniques have been used to identify the appropriate semantic relation based on the context from multiple sentences.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on such works as well as a taxonomy for deep learning-based refactoring. To this end, in this paper, we present a survey on deep learning-based software refactoring. We classify related works into five categories according to the major tasks they cover. Among these categories, we further present key aspects (i.e., code smell types, refactoring types, training strategies, and evaluation) to give insight into the details of the technologies that have supported refactoring through deep learning. The classification indicates that there is an imbalance in the adoption of deep learning techniques for the process of refactoring. Most of the deep learning techniques have been used for the detection of code smells and the recommendation of refactoring solutions as found in 56.25\\% and 33.33\\% of the literature respectively. In contrast, only 6.25\\% and 4.17\\% were towards the end-to-end code transformation as refactoring and the mining of refactorings, respectively. Notably, we found no literature representation for the quality assurance for refactoring. We also observe that most of the deep learning techniques have been used to support refactoring processes occurring at the method level whereas classes and variables attracted minimal attention. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with the employment of deep learning-based refactorings and present some potential research opportunities for future work.\n4th paper: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with residual links (ResNets) and causal dilated convolutional units have been the network of choice for deep learning approaches to speech enhancement. While residual links improve gradient flow during training, feature diminution of shallow layer outputs can occur due to repetitive summations with deeper layer outputs. One strategy to improve feature re-usage is to fuse both ResNets and densely connected CNNs (DenseNets). DenseNets, however, over-allocate parameters for feature re-usage. Motivated by this, we propose the residual-dense lattice network (RDL-Net), which is a new CNN for speech enhancement that employs both residual and dense aggregations without over-allocating parameters for feature re-usage. This is managed through the topology of the RDL blocks, which limit the number of outputs used for dense aggregations. Our extensive experimental investigation shows that RDL-Nets are able to achieve a higher speech enhancement performance than CNNs that employ residual and/or dense aggregations. RDL-Nets also use substantially fewer parameters and have a lower computational requirement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RDL-Nets outperform many state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to speech enhancement.\n5th paper: Contextual Relation Extraction (CRE) is mainly used for constructing a knowledge graph with a help of ontology. It performs various tasks such as semantic search, query answering, and textual entailment. Relation extraction identifies the entities from raw texts and the relations among them. An efficient and accurate CRE system is essential for creating domain knowledge in the biomedical industry. Existing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are not suitable to predict complex relations from sentences that consist of more than two relations and unspecified entities efficiently. In this work, deep learning techniques have been used to identify the appropriate semantic relation based on the context from multiple sentences. Even though various machine learning models have been used for relation extraction, they provide better results only for binary relations, i.e., relations occurred exactly between the two entities in a sentence. Machine learning models are not suited for complex sentences that consist of the words that have various meanings. To address these issues, hybrid deep learning models have been used to extract the relations from complex sentence effectively. This paper explores the analysis of various deep learning models that are used for relation extraction.\n\n\nPlease begin writing research insights that you can gain based on your research experience and the academic context.

However, building machine learning models using this data is both challenging and time consuming. The core problem is that no machine learning method is capable of learning on multiple tables interconnected by primary-foreign key relations. Current methods can only learn from a single table, so the data must first be manually joined and aggregated into a single training table, the process known as feature engineering. Feature engineering is slow, error prone and leads to suboptimal models. Here we introduce an end-to-end deep representation learning approach to directly learn on data laid out across multiple tables. We name our approach Relational Deep Learning (RDL). The core idea is to view relational databases as a temporal, heterogeneous graph, with a node for each row in each table, and edges specified by primary-foreign key links. Message Passing Graph Neural Networks can then automatically learn across the graph to extract representations that leverage all input data, without any manual feature engineering. Relational Deep Learning leads to more accurate models that can be built much faster. To facilitate research in this area, we develop RelBench, a set of benchmark datasets and an implementation of Relational Deep Learning. The data covers a wide spectrum, from discussions on Stack Exchange to book reviews on the Amazon Product Catalog. Overall, we define a new research area that generalizes graph machine learning and broadens its applicability to a wide set of AI use cases.\"]\nYOU SHOULD REFER TO IT FIRST!\n"
