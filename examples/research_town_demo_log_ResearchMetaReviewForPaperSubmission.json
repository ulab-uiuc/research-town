    "weakness": "**Weaknesses Summary:**\n\n1. **Complexity and Interpretability:**\n   - The proposed hybrid GNN architecture, while innovative, introduces significant complexity by combining Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs), Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) techniques. This complexity may hinder interpretability and make it challenging for practitioners to understand and implement the model effectively.\n\n2. **Scalability Concerns:**\n   - The integration of TDA and the hybrid nature of the GNN may lead to scalability issues, particularly for very large graphs. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead and scalability of the proposed approach, which is crucial for real-world applications.\n\n3. **Generalization and Overfitting:**\n   - While the paper claims improved predictive accuracy, it does not thoroughly address the potential risk of overfitting due to the increased model complexity. More extensive validation on diverse and unseen datasets would strengthen the claims about the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis:**\n   - The experimental results section lacks a comprehensive comparative analysis with a broader range of state-of-the-art models. Including more baseline comparisons and ablation studies would provide a clearer understanding of the specific contributions and advantages of each component of the hybrid GNN.\n\n5. **Edge Computing Feasibility:**\n   - Although the paper explores AutoML-driven GNN customization for edge computing environments, it does not provide sufficient empirical evidence or benchmarks to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach in real-time, resource-constrained scenarios. Detailed experiments and performance metrics on edge devices would be beneficial.\n\n6. **Application Scope:**\n   - The paper mentions applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis but does not provide detailed case studies or domain-specific insights. Including more application-specific results and discussions would help illustrate the practical impact and versatility of the proposed framework.\n\n7. **Reproducibility:**\n   - The paper does not provide enough details on the implementation, hyperparameters, and experimental setup, which are essential for reproducibility. Providing a comprehensive supplementary material or open-sourcing the code would enhance the credibility and usability of the research.\n\n8. **Theoretical Justification:**\n   - While the integration of positional and identity information, along with TDA, is conceptually appealing, the paper lacks a rigorous theoretical justification or analysis of why and how these components synergistically improve the GNN's performance. A deeper theoretical exploration would add significant value to the work",
