    "weakness": "### Weaknesses Summary\n\n1. **Complexity and Scalability**: The integration of Positional GNNs (P-GNNs), Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), and quantum-inspired techniques introduces significant complexity. This complexity may pose scalability issues, particularly for extremely large-scale graphs or real-time dynamic graph scenarios. The computational overhead might limit the model's practical applicability.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation Scope**: The empirical evaluations are limited to specific real-world datasets, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results. The scope of the datasets used does not fully capture the diversity of dynamic graph scenarios, which could weaken the claims of adaptability and performance.\n\n3. **Quantum-inspired Techniques**: The practical implementation details and computational costs associated with the quantum-inspired graph reduction techniques are not thoroughly discussed. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the feasibility and practicality of these techniques in real-world applications.\n\n4. **Noise Mitigation Techniques**: The paper lacks a detailed analysis of how the advanced noise mitigation techniques from quantum error correction impact the overall performance and robustness of the model. A deeper exploration of the trade-offs between noise mitigation and computational efficiency is needed.\n\n5. **Integration Challenges**: The paper does not sufficiently address potential challenges in harmonizing positional and identity-aware information within the hybrid GNN model. Detailed ablation studies or sensitivity analyses are missing, which could provide insights into how each component contributes to the model's performance.\n\n6. **Theoretical Justification**: The theoretical underpinnings of the proposed hybrid model and quantum-inspired techniques are not fully explored. A more rigorous theoretical analysis would help in understanding the fundamental principles driving the observed improvements in performance and robustness.\n\n7. **Reproducibility**: The paper lacks detailed information on the experimental setup, hyperparameter tuning, and implementation specifics. This omission can hinder reproducibility and the ability of other researchers to validate and build upon the work. Providing comprehensive details and open-sourcing the code would address this issue.\n\n8. **Comparative Analysis**: Although the proposed model outperforms existing methods, the paper does not provide a thorough comparative analysis with a wide range of state-of-the-art techniques. Including more baseline models and conducting a detailed comparison would offer a clearer picture of the relative advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.\n\n### Rebuttals Summary\n\n1. **Complexity and Scalability**: The authors acknowledge the concern and highlight that empirical results demonstrate effective scalability with large datasets. They have optimized the integration to minimize computational load and will",
