    "abstract": "### Abstract\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) model tailored for dynamic graphs, which synergizes the strengths of Positional GNNs (P-GNNs) and Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs). This hybrid model dynamically adjusts node embeddings by integrating both positional and identity-aware information, thereby enhancing adaptability and performance in evolving graph structures. Additionally, we explore the application of quantum-inspired graph reduction techniques to preprocess large graphs, making them more manageable for classical GNNs. Specifically, we extend the Red-QAOA approach by incorporating advanced noise mitigation techniques from quantum error correction, thereby improving the robustness of quantum algorithms for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our hybrid GNN model significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of adaptability and accuracy, while the quantum-inspired graph reduction techniques effectively reduce computational complexity and noise sensitivity. This research opens new avenues for the application of GNNs in dynamic and large-scale graph scenarios, offering a robust framework for future developments in the field.",
