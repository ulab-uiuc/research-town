    "bio": " I am a researcher in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and machine learning, with a focus on developing and improving GNN architectures for various tasks. I have made significant contributions to the understanding of GNNs and their applications in prediction tasks on graphs.\n\nI have proposed Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNNs sample sets of anchor nodes, compute the distance of a given target node to each anchor-set, and then learn a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation scheme over the anchor-sets. This allows P-GNNs to capture the positions/locations of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes. I have shown that P-GNNs consistently outperform state-of-the-art GNNs, with up to 66% improvement in terms of the ROC AUC score on multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community detection.\n\nI have also investigated the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance. I developed a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. I have shown that a \"sweet spot\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance, and that neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph.\n\nIn addition, I have developed a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test. ID-GNNs extend existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing, and have been shown to improve the performance of existing GNN architectures on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks, as well as node and graph classification benchmarks and real-world link prediction tasks.\n\nI have also worked on the problem of applying GNNs to dynamic graphs, proposing ROLAND, an effective graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. ROLAND can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs, and I have conducted experiments over eight different dynamic graph",

My research has made significant contributions to the understanding of networks in social, technological, and natural domains, with a particular emphasis on incorporating attribute information into network models.\n\nIn my earlier work, I studied anonymized data from the Microsoft Messenger instant-messaging system, constructing the largest social network ever analyzed at the time and reporting on various aspects of the dataset and synthesized graph. I also developed the Multiplicative Attribute Graph (MAG) model, which considers nodes with categorical attributes and models the probability of an edge as the product of individual attribute link formation affinities. This model was shown to reliably capture network connectivity and provide insights into how different attributes shape the network structure.\n\nIn more recent work, I have developed the Latent Multi-group Membership Graph (LMMG) model, which allows for the modeling of networks with rich node feature structure. In the LMMG model, each node belongs to multiple groups, and each latent group models the occurrence of links as well as the node feature structure. This model can be used to summarize the network structure, predict links between nodes, and predict missing features of a node. I have also studied the Multiplicative Attribute Graphs (MAG) model, which naturally captures the interactions between the network structure and the node attributes. This model yields itself to mathematical analysis and allows for the derivation of thresholds for connectivity and the emergence of the giant connected component, and shows that the model gives rise to networks with a constant diameter.\n\nIn addition to my work on network analysis, I have also applied machine learning techniques to the problem of large-scale image retrieval, extending benchmark datasets with social-network metadata and proposing a model that explicitly accounts for the interdependencies between images sharing common properties. I have also developed a model for automatically identifying users' social circles in personal social networks, and a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience.\n\nI have also studied the dynamics of time-varying network data, proposing a nonparametric multi-group membership model for dynamic networks. This model contains three main components: We model the birth and death of individual groups with respect to the dynamics of the network structure via a distance dependent Indian Buffet Process",

I have also considered the problem of optimal resource allocation from a robust optimization perspective, and have shown that a nonconvex version of the Budget Allocation or Bipartite Influence Maximization problem can be solved exactly using connections to continuous submodular functions.\n\nI have also contributed to the field of Bayesian optimization, proposing a new criterion called Max-value Entropy Search (MES) that uses information about the maximum function value rather than the entropy. I have shown that MES maintains or improves the good empirical performance of existing methods while significantly reducing the computational burden.\n\nIn the area of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), I have studied DRO with uncertainty sets measured via maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), showing that MMD DRO is roughly equivalent to regularization by the Hilbert norm and revealing deep connections to classic results in statistical learning. I have also derived a generically applicable approximation of MMD DRO and shown that it generalizes recent work on variance-based regularization.\n\nI am also interested in the implicit bias induced by the training of neural networks, and have shown that when one trains a deep nonlinear network with logistic or exponential loss on linearly separable data, the weights converge to rank-1 matrices. I have also studied the theoretical properties of kernel ridge regression on compact manifolds, providing minimax optimal rates for target functions that are invariant to a group action on the manifold.\n\nIn my most recent work, I have considered the question of whether graph neural networks can generalize to graphs that are different from the graphs they were trained on, and have demonstrated how the operator perspective allows for the development of quantitative bounds on the distance between a finite GNN and its limit on an infinite graph.",

My work has explored a variety of topics, including structural feature correlation in geometric graphs, temporal graph neural networks, and hyperbolic graph convolutional neural networks.\n\nIn my research on structural feature correlation, I introduced graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional space to explore the correlation between structural features in geometric graphs. I showed that there exists high correlation between some of the structural features, and that using an irredundant feature combination with initial node features, filtered by a graph neural network, can improve classification accuracy in graph-based tasks.\n\nIn the area of temporal graphs, I proposed a novel approach called Temporal Motifs Explainer (TempME) to uncover the most pivotal temporal motifs guiding the prediction of temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). TempME extracts the most interaction-related motifs while minimizing the amount of contained information to preserve the sparsity and succinctness of the explanation. This approach has been shown to provide more understandable insights and improve the explanation accuracy of current TGNNs.\n\nI have also worked on extending graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) to hyperbolic geometry, which enables embeddings with much smaller distortion for real-world graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure. I proposed the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs.\n\nIn addition to my work on graph representation and analysis, I am also interested in the interpretability and trustworthiness of GNNs. I have conducted a comprehensive review of explanation methods for GNNs from the perspective of graph generation, proposing a unified optimization objective for generative explanation methods and demonstrating their specific manifestations in various generative model architectures and different explanation scenarios.\n\nOverall, my research is focused on developing models for graph representation and analysis, with a particular emphasis on structural feature correlation, temporal graph neural networks, and hyperbolic graph convolutional neural networks.
