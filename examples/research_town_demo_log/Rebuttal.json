We have carefully considered the comments and would like to address the weaknesses pointed out as follows:\n\n1. **Overly Ambitious Scope**: We acknowledge that the paper covers a wide range of topics. However, each component is interconnected and contributes to the overall goal of enhancing the performance and scalability of quantum and classical graph-based optimization and learning algorithms. In the revised version of the paper, we will provide a more focused and detailed analysis of each component, ensuring that the depth of the research is not compromised.\n\n2. **Insufficient Theoretical Analysis**: We agree that providing a theoretical grounding for the proposed methods is essential. In the revised version of the paper, we will include detailed theoretical analysis, including proofs of convergence, optimality, and complexity for both Red-QAOA and PolyFormer. This will establish the validity and robustness of the proposed approaches.\n\n3. **Lack of Detailed Methodology**: We understand the need for detailed information on the specific techniques and algorithms used in Red-QAOA and PolyFormer. In the revised version of the paper, we will provide a comprehensive description of the simulated annealing-based graph reduction, the attention mechanism in PolyFormer, and the integration with classical optimization techniques. This will ensure that the methodology is clearly described and understood.\n\n4. **Empirical Evaluation**: While the abstract mentions extensive experiments, we agree that providing specific details on the datasets, benchmarks, and metrics used for evaluation is crucial. In the revised version of the paper, we will include detailed information on the datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics used in our experiments. This will allow for a thorough assessment of the validity and generalizability of the experimental results.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: We acknowledge the importance of providing a comparative analysis with existing methods. In the revised version of the paper, we will include detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques, including quantitative results and statistical significance. This will substantiate our claims that Red-QAOA and PolyFormer outperform existing methods.\n\n6. **Practical Implementation**: We understand the importance of addressing practical implementation challenges. In the revised version of the paper, we will discuss the computational requirements, scalability issues, and integration with existing systems for both Red-QAOA and PolyFormer. This will provide a clearer understanding of the practical aspects of implementing the proposed methods.\n\n7. **Real-World Applications**: We agree that providing specific examples or case studies demonstrating the practical utility of Red-QAOA and",
