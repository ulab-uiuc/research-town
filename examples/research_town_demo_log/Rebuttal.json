    "content": " Rebuttal:\n\nThank you for the detailed reviews and constructive feedback. We have carefully considered the comments and would like to address the weaknesses pointed out as follows:\n\n1. Lack of Novelty: We agree that benchmarking GNNs is not a new idea, but we believe that our proposed benchmarking framework provides a unique contribution to the field by comparing the performance of different GNN architectures on various graph-based prediction tasks and evaluating their effectiveness in addressing specific challenges in graph-based tasks. We will consider developing novel evaluation metrics or testing on new datasets to further enhance the novelty of our work.\n2. Overambitious: We acknowledge that the paper covers a wide range of topics, and we will consider focusing on a few specific areas and providing a more in-depth analysis in the revised version of the paper.\n3. Insufficient Detail: We will provide more detail on the methodology of the proposed research, including the datasets that will be used for benchmarking, the evaluation metrics, and the specifics of the new GNN architectures.\n4. Limited Context: We will provide a more comprehensive review of the literature to situate the proposed research within the current state of the field.\n5. Lack of Empirical Evaluation: We will include preliminary results or simulations to demonstrate the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed research.\n6. Relation to Related Work: We will provide a more detailed explanation of the connections between the proposed research and the related work.\n7. Generalization of Results: We will provide a discussion on the limitations of the proposed methods and their applicability to other domains.\n8. Theoretical Analysis: We acknowledge the importance of a theoretical analysis of the proposed methods, and we will include a discussion on their convergence properties and optimality guarantees in the revised version of the paper.\n\nWe believe that the revisions addressed the weaknesses pointed out in the reviews and enhanced the quality and impact of the paper. We look forward to the opportunity to revise and resubmit the paper.\n\nThank you again for the constructive feedback.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
