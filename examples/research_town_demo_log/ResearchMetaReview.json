    "weakness": "**Weaknesses of the Paper:**\n\n1. **Complexity and Implementation Challenges:**\n   - The integration of Topology-Aware AutoML, Edge Computing, and GNNs introduces significant complexity. The paper does not provide sufficient details on how these components are seamlessly integrated, which could pose challenges for reproducibility and practical deployment.\n\n2. **Scalability Concerns:**\n   - While the paper claims improvements in scalability and responsiveness, it lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Topology-Aware AutoML process itself. The additional computational cost of incorporating topological data analysis (TDA) into the AutoML framework is not clearly quantified.\n\n3. **Limited Experimental Scope:**\n   - The experimental results, although promising, are not comprehensive enough. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with a wide range of state-of-the-art methods or across diverse real-world datasets. This limits the generalizability of the findings and the ability to assess the true performance gains of the proposed approach.\n\n4. **Edge Computing Deployment Details:**\n   - The discussion on deploying optimized GNNs in cloud/edge computing environments is somewhat superficial. The paper lacks detailed insights into the specific edge computing architectures used, the communication overhead between cloud and edge nodes, and how these factors impact the overall system performance.\n\n5. **Dynamic Graph Handling:**\n   - While the paper mentions that the approach is suited for dynamic graph structures, it does not provide a detailed methodology or experimental validation on how the proposed system adapts to changes in the graph topology over time. This is crucial for applications in highly dynamic environments like network security and industrial automation.\n\n6. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n   - The paper does not clearly define the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the discovered GNN architectures. A more detailed explanation of the metrics and their relevance to the specific applications would strengthen the validity of the experimental results.\n\n7. **Theoretical Justification:**\n   - The theoretical underpinnings of how topological features guide the AutoML process are not thoroughly explained. A deeper theoretical analysis or justification of why and how TDA improves the search for optimal GNN architectures would enhance the credibility of the proposed approach.\n\n8. **Resource Constraints:**\n   - The paper does not address potential resource constraints in edge computing environments, such as limited computational power, memory, and energy efficiency. These factors are critical for practical deployment and should be considered in the evaluation of the proposed method.",
