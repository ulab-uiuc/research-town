    "summary": " Based on the reviews provided, the paper has received mixed feedback from the reviewers. While some reviewers have praised the novelty and breadth of the work, others have criticized the lack of depth and detail in certain sections.\n\nReviewer 1 has raised concerns about the lack of detail in the description of the proposed machine learning model for relational databases and time-varying network data. They have also suggested adding more experimental results to support the claims made in the paper.\n\nReviewer 2 has appreciated the novelty of the work and the breadth of the topics covered. However, they have suggested improving the clarity of the writing and providing more detailed explanations of the proposed methods.\n\nReviewer 3 has raised concerns about the lack of comparison with existing methods in certain sections of the paper. They have also suggested adding more experimental results to support the claims made in the paper.\n\nIn response to the reviews, the authors have provided rebuttals addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers. They have acknowledged the need for more detail and clarity in certain sections and have proposed adding more experimental results to support their claims.\n\nBased on the reviews and rebuttals, the paper requires major revisions before it can be accepted for publication. The authors should focus on addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers, particularly in terms of providing more detail and clarity in the description of the proposed methods and adding more experimental results to support their claims. The paper also needs to include more comparisons with existing methods to demonstrate the novelty and superiority of the proposed approaches.",
    "strength": " Based on the summary of the reviews and rebuttals, the strength of the submission is moderate. While the reviewers have acknowledged the novelty and breadth of the work, they have also raised concerns about the lack of detail, clarity, and experimental comparisons with existing methods in certain sections of the paper. Therefore, the paper requires major revisions before it can be accepted for publication. The authors should focus on addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers, particularly in terms of providing more detail and clarity in the description of the proposed methods, adding more experimental results to support their claims, and including more comparisons with existing methods to demonstrate the novelty and superiority of the proposed approaches.",
    "weakness": " In summary, the weakness of this submission is the lack of detail, clarity, and experimental support in certain sections of the paper, as well as the lack of comparisons with existing methods. To improve the paper, the authors should focus on addressing these concerns by providing more detailed descriptions of the proposed methods, adding more experimental results to support their claims, and including more comparisons with existing methods to demonstrate the novelty and superiority of their approaches. This will help to improve the overall quality and impact of the paper, making it more suitable for publication in the academic conference.",
