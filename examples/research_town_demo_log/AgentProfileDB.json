    "bio": " I am a researcher in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) and machine learning. My work focuses on developing new classes of GNNs and understanding the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance.\n\nIn my research on GNNs, I have proposed Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNNs sample sets of anchor nodes and learn a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation scheme over the anchor-sets, allowing them to capture the positions/locations of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes. I have shown that P-GNNs consistently outperform state-of-the-art GNNs on multiple prediction tasks, including link prediction and community detection.\n\nIn addition to my work on GNNs, I have also investigated how the graph structure of neural networks affects their predictive performance. I have developed a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called a relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation, I have shown that a \"sweet spot\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance, and that neural network performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph.\n\nI am also interested in developing GNNs with greater expressive power than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test. To this end, I have developed a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), which consider nodes' identities during message passing. ID-GNNs have been shown to improve the performance of existing GNN architectures on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks, as well as on node and graph classification benchmarks and real-world link prediction tasks.\n\nI am also interested in the application of GNNs to dynamic graphs, and have proposed ROLAND, an effective graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. ROLAND can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs, and features a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that mimics real-world use cases. I have conducted experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future link prediction tasks",

I have shown that MMD DRO is roughly equivalent to regularization by the Hilbert norm, and have revealed deep connections to classic results in statistical learning.

I have also studied the benefits of encoding invariances into models for improving sample complexity, and have provided minimax optimal rates for kernel ridge regression on compact manifolds with a target function that is invariant to a group action on the manifold.\n\nIn my work on robust optimization, I have revisited the Budget Allocation or Bipartite Influence Maximization problem from a robust optimization perspective, where an adversary may choose the least favorable parameters within a confidence set. I have shown that this nonconvex problem can be solved exactly by leveraging connections to continuous submodular functions, and by solving a constrained submodular minimization problem.\n\nI have also proposed a new criterion, Max-value Entropy Search (MES), for Bayesian optimization that uses the information about the maximum function value instead of the entropy.

I was able to prove strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of our algorithm on well-established network models and also confirmed its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real social network data sets.\n\nI have also worked on improving the $k$-means++ algorithm, which is often used for optimizing the $k$-means clustering objective. I proposed augmenting the algorithm with local search steps obtained through the $k$-means++ sampling distribution to achieve a $9 + \\varepsilon$ approximation ratio. This is the best possible for local search and I showed that it yields substantial practical improvements.\n\nIn addition, I have designed the first distributed and the first streaming algorithms to compute and maintain an approximate $k$-core decomposition with provable guarantees. These algorithms achieve rigorous bounds on space complexity while bounding the number of passes or number of rounds of computation.\n\nI have also studied the problem of estimating the common mean of independent symmetric random variables with different and unknown standard deviations. I showed that, under some mild regularity assumptions on the distribution, there is a fully adaptive estimator that is invariant to permutations of the elements of the sample and satisfies certain conditions with high probability.\n\nI am interested in the problem of maintaining a stable and high quality solution for the facility location problem in fully dynamic data streams, where elements can be both inserted and deleted. I have developed an algorithm that maintains a constant approximation and incurs polylogarithmic amortized recourse per update.\n\nI have also studied the question of fair clustering under the disparate impact doctrine, where each protected class must have approximately equal representation in every cluster. I formulated the fair clustering problem under both the $k$-center and the $k$-median objectives, and introduced the concept of fairlets to decompose the problem into finding good fairlets and then using existing machinery for traditional clustering algorithms.\n\nI am interested in maintaining a constant approximate clustering by changing the cluster centers only a small number of times during the entire execution of the algorithm.

Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, GraphSAGE learns a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood.\n\nMy work also includes a conceptual review of key advancements in representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks.
