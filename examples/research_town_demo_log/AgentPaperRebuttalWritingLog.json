    "rebuttal_content": "### Rebuttal\n\nWe appreciate the reviewers' detailed feedback and constructive criticism. Below, we address the key concerns raised and provide clarifications to strengthen our submission.\n\n#### Complexity and Scalability\n\n**Reviewer Concern:** The complexity of integrating multiple advanced methods may pose scalability issues.\n\n**Response:** We acknowledge the concern regarding the potential computational overhead. However, our empirical results demonstrate that the hybrid model scales effectively with large datasets. We have optimized the integration of Positional GNNs and Identity-aware GNNs to minimize redundancy and computational load. Additionally, the quantum-inspired graph reduction techniques significantly reduce the size of the input graphs, thereby mitigating scalability issues. We will include more detailed performance metrics and scalability analyses in the revised version to illustrate this point more clearly.\n\n#### Empirical Evaluation Scope\n\n**Reviewer Concern:** The generalizability of the results to a broader range of dynamic graph scenarios remains uncertain.\n\n**Response:** We agree that broader benchmarking would strengthen our claims. In the revised version, we will include additional experiments on a wider variety of datasets, including synthetic and real-world dynamic graphs of different types and scales. This will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of our model's adaptability and accuracy across diverse scenarios.\n\n#### Quantum-inspired Techniques\n\n**Reviewer Concern:** Practical implementation details and computational costs associated with quantum-inspired techniques are not thoroughly discussed.\n\n**Response:** We appreciate this feedback and will provide a more detailed discussion on the implementation and computational costs of the quantum-inspired techniques. We will include a section that outlines the practical steps taken to integrate these techniques and their impact on computational efficiency. This will help clarify the feasibility of applying these methods in real-world settings.\n\n#### Noise Mitigation Techniques\n\n**Reviewer Concern:** Lack of detailed analysis on how noise mitigation techniques impact overall performance and robustness.\n\n**Response:** We will expand our analysis to include a detailed examination of the noise mitigation techniques and their effects on performance and robustness. This will involve presenting ablation studies that isolate the impact of these techniques, as well as a discussion on the trade-offs between noise mitigation and computational efficiency.\n\n#### Integration Challenges\n\n**Reviewer Concern:** Potential challenges in harmonizing positional and identity-aware information are not sufficiently addressed.\n\n**Response:** We will include detailed ablation studies and sensitivity analyses to provide insights into the integration of positional and identity-aware information. These studies will highlight the individual contributions of each component and demonstrate how they synergize to enhance the model's performance.\n\n#### Theoretical Justification\n\n**Reviewer Concern:** The theoretical underpinnings of the proposed hybrid model and quantum-inspired techniques are not fully explored.\n\n**"

Below, we provide clarifications and additional information to address the identified weaknesses and reinforce the strengths of our submission.\n\n#### Complexity and Scalability\n\nWhile we acknowledge that integrating positional and identity-aware information, along with advanced noise mitigation techniques, introduces complexity, our empirical results demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the computational overhead. We have optimized our hybrid model to ensure scalability, and our experiments on large-scale datasets confirm its feasibility. Additionally, we are actively working on further optimizations and plan to include these in the final version of the paper.\n\n#### Empirical Evaluation Scope\n\nWe agree that broader empirical evaluations would strengthen our claims.
