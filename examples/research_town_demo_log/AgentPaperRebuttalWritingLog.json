We would like to address the concerns raised to clarify and strengthen our submission.\n\n#### 1. Complexity and Practicality of Quantum Integration\nWhile it is true that quantum hardware is still developing, our work is forward-looking and aims to bridge the gap between current classical methods and future quantum capabilities. We have designed our hybrid model to be adaptable to advancements in quantum technology. Moreover, our integration of QAOA with classical GNNs is structured to provide immediate benefits even with current quantum simulators, as demonstrated in our experiments.\n\n#### 2. Limited Benchmarking on Quantum Hardware\nWe acknowledge the importance of benchmarking on actual quantum hardware. However, given the current limitations of quantum devices, extensive benchmarking on classical simulators is a necessary first step. We have included preliminary results on available quantum hardware in the supplementary material and plan to expand this as quantum technology matures. Our focus on classical simulations ensures that our methods are robust and ready for future quantum advancements.\n\n#### 3. Scalability of Red-QAOA\nWe have conducted additional experiments to analyze the scalability and efficiency of Red-QAOA on larger graphs.
