We are pleased to see that the reviewers recognize the strengths and contributions of our work, particularly the innovative hybrid approach, specialized evaluation framework, and new generalization metrics. We would like to address the concerns raised to further clarify and strengthen our submission.\n\n1. **Complexity and Scalability:**\n   - **Response:** We acknowledge the concern regarding the computational complexity of our hybrid approach. In the revised version, we will include a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of our method. Preliminary results indicate that our approach scales linearly with the number of nodes and edges, making it feasible for large-scale graphs. We will also provide empirical evidence demonstrating the scalability on large real-world datasets.\n\n2. **Evaluation Framework Generality:**\n   - **Response:** While our evaluation framework is tailored for safety-critical applications, the underlying principles of robustness testing, adversarial attack simulations, and reliability assessments are broadly applicable. We will expand the discussion to highlight how the framework can be adapted to other domains, such as social networks and financial systems, thereby demonstrating its broader applicability.\n\n3. **Experimental Validation:**\n   - **Response:** We agree that a more extensive set of experiments would strengthen our validation. In the revised submission, we will include additional experiments on a wider variety of datasets, including real-world scenarios from different domains. This will provide a more comprehensive validation of our proposed methods and metrics.\n\n4. **Adversarial Robustness:**\n   - **Response:** We appreciate the importance of detailing the types of adversarial attacks considered. We will include a more detailed discussion on the adversarial attack scenarios we tested, including gradient-based attacks, perturbation-based attacks, and structural attacks. Additionally, we will provide results demonstrating the robustness of our hybrid GNN approach against these attacks.\n\n5. **Interpretability:**\n   - **Response:** We recognize the importance of interpretability in safety-critical applications. We will include a section discussing methods for interpreting the decisions of our hybrid GNN model, such as feature importance analysis and attention mechanisms. This will provide insights into the decision-making process of the model.\n\n6. **Comparative Analysis:**\n   - **Response:** We will expand our comparative analysis to include more state-of-the-art methods. This will provide a clearer picture of the improvements offered by our new topology-aware generalization metrics. We will also include additional baseline comparisons to strengthen our claims.\n\n7. **Theoretical Justification:**\n   - **Response"
