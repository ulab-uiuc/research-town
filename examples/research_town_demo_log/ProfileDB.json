    "bio": " I am a researcher with a focus on developing and improving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for various tasks and applications. I have proposed Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), which compute position-aware node embeddings by sampling sets of anchor nodes and learning a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation scheme over the anchor-sets. This allows P-GNNs to capture the positions/locations of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes, and they have been shown to consistently outperform state-of-the-art GNNs on multiple prediction tasks.\n\nI have also investigated the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance, and developed a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph. I have shown that a \"sweet spot\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance, and that top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks.\n\nAdditionally, I have developed a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. I have also proposed ROLAND, an effective graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs, which can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs, and introduced a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that mimics real-world use cases.\n\nI have also studied the architectural design space for GNNs, which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different predictive tasks, and defined a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for a given novel task/dataset, we can quickly identify/transfer the best performing architecture. I have also released GraphGym, a powerful platform for exploring different GNN designs and tasks.\n\nI have also proposed FALCON, an efficient sample-based method to search for the optimal model design, which models the design space of possible model designs as a design graph, and uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform message passing on the design graph and a task-specific module to conduct label propagation of the known model performance information on the design graph",

This model has been used to study the structure of networks in social, technological, and natural domains, and has been shown to reliably capture network connectivity and provide insights into how different attributes shape the network structure.\n\nI have also developed the Latent Multi-group Membership Graph (LMMG) model, which allows for the modeling of networks with rich node feature structure. In the LMMG model, each node belongs to multiple groups, and each latent group models the occurrence of links as well as the node feature structure. This model can be used to summarize the network structure, predict links between nodes, and predict missing features of a node.\n\nI have studied the task of automatically identifying users' social circles in large-scale social networks, posing it as a multi-membership node clustering problem on a user's ego-network. I have developed a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information, and have shown that it accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google+, and Twitter.\n\nI have also worked on the development of a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience, in order to recommend products that a user will enjoy now while acknowledging that their tastes may have changed over time.\n\nAdditionally, I have studied the relationship between Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) in terms of feature/label smoothing and influence, and have proposed an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node classification.\n\nI have also worked on the analysis of time-varying network data, proposing a nonparametric multi-group membership model for dynamic networks that models the birth and death of individual groups, captures the evolution of individual node group memberships, and explains the dynamics of the network structure by explicitly modeling the connectivity structure of groups.\n\nI have also studied the problem of donor retention in online crowdfunding platforms, presenting a large-scale study of",

My recent work has centered around the theoretical properties of various neural network architectures and their applications.\n\nOne of my key areas of expertise is in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are targeted to learning representations of graphs for prediction tasks. I have contributed to the emerging theoretical results on approximation and learning properties of widely used message passing GNNs and higher-order GNNs, with a focus on representation, generalization, and extrapolation. I have also made mathematical connections between these concepts.\n\nIn addition to my work on GNNs, I have also studied the properties of ResNets and their ability to uniformly approximate any Lebesgue integrable function in d dimensions. I have shown that the ResNet architecture increases the representational power for narrow deep networks.\n\nI have also explored the problem of optimal resource allocation and demonstrated a robust optimization perspective on the Budget Allocation or Bipartite Influence Maximization problem. I have shown that this nonconvex problem can be solved exactly by leveraging connections to continuous submodular functions.\n\nIn the area of Bayesian optimization, I have proposed a new criterion called Max-value Entropy Search (MES) that uses information about the maximum function value, rather than the entropy. I have established a regret bound and shown that MES maintains or improves the good empirical performance of existing methods while significantly reducing the computational burden.\n\nI have also studied Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and its connections to regularization, generalization, and robustness. I have shown that MMD DRO is roughly equivalent to regularization by the Hilbert norm and have revealed deep connections to classic results in statistical learning.\n\nFinally, I have explored the implicit bias induced by the training of neural networks and have shown that when training a deep linear network with logistic or exponential loss on linearly separable data, the weights converge to rank-1 matrices. I have extended this theoretical result to the last few linear layers of the much wider class of nonlinear ReLU-activated feedforward networks containing fully-connected layers and skip connections.\n\nOverall, my research is focused on the theoretical properties of machine learning models and their applications, with a particular emphasis on neural network architectures and their ability to learn and generalize from data.",

    "bio": " I am a researcher with a focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications in various fields. Recently, I have been exploring the correlation analysis of structural features in geometric graphs using GNNs. I introduced graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional space to explore preliminary results on structural feature correlation. The results showed that there exists high correlation between some of the structural features, and an irredundant feature combination with initial node features, which is filtered by GNN, has improved its classification accuracy in some graph-based tasks. I have also compared differences between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings between features and showed that the simplest is the best. I have generalized these findings on synthetic geometric graphs and certified the results on prediction difficulty between structural features.\n\nIn addition, I have proposed a novel approach called Temporal Motifs Explainer (TempME) to uncover the most pivotal temporal motifs guiding the prediction of temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). TempME extracts the most interaction-related motifs while minimizing the amount of contained information to preserve the sparsity and succinctness of the explanation. The explanations generated by TempME are verified to be more spatiotemporally correlated than those of existing approaches, providing more understandable insights.\n\nFurthermore, I have worked on extending GCNs to hyperbolic geometry, which presents several unique challenges because it is not clear how to define neural network operations, such as feature transformation and aggregation, in hyperbolic space. I have proposed Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs.\n\nI am also interested in the problem of encoding graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. I have provided a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. I have reviewed methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs and developed a unified framework to describe these recent approaches.\n\nLastly, I have proposed Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P",
