    "abstract": "Abstract:\n\nThis paper introduces two innovative approaches aimed at enhancing the performance and scalability of quantum and classical graph-based optimization and learning algorithms: Red-QAOA and PolyFormer. \n\n**Red-QAOA**: We propose Red-QAOA, a novel method for reducing noise in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through graph reduction. Red-QAOA leverages a simulated annealing-based graph reduction technique to create a smaller, distilled graph that retains the essential characteristics of the original graph. This reduction results in a smaller quantum circuit, thereby mitigating noise sensitivity. We further develop a hybrid quantum-classical optimization framework that combines Red-QAOA with classical optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing to enhance noise resilience and optimization performance. Additionally, we explore adaptive graph reduction techniques that dynamically adjust based on real-time noise measurements and optimization progress. The application of Red-QAOA in quantum machine learning tasks, such as quantum support vector machines and quantum neural networks, is investigated to reduce noise and improve performance. We also explore cross-domain applications of Red-QAOA in quantum chemistry, quantum communication networks, and social network analysis, and investigate its integration with quantum error correction techniques to further mitigate noise.\n\n**PolyFormer**: We introduce PolyFormer, a scalable node-wise filter for Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that leverages the attention mechanism to directly learn node-wise filters efficiently. PolyFormer captures spectral information, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining scalability. We develop a multi-scale version of PolyFormer to analyze graphs at different scales simultaneously, capturing both local and global structures for improved performance on complex tasks. We also investigate the use of PolyFormer for graph anomaly detection, graph-based natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and real-time graph processing. Additionally, we explore the application of PolyFormer to multi-modal graphs incorporating different data types and develop extensions to handle hierarchical graphs.\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Red-QAOA significantly reduces node and edge counts while maintaining low mean square error, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN-based pooling techniques. PolyFormer shows superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, handling graphs containing up to 100 million nodes. Our findings highlight the potential of Red-QAOA and PolyFormer in addressing complex graph-based challenges across various domains, providing a valuable framework for future research and applications in quantum and classical graph-based optimization and learning.",
