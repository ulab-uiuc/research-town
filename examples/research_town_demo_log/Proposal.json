    "abstract": "Abstract:\n\nThis paper introduces two innovative approaches to enhance the performance and scalability of quantum and classical graph-based optimization and learning algorithms: Red-QAOA and PolyFormer. \n\n**Red-QAOA**: We present Red-QAOA, a novel method for reducing noise in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through graph reduction. Red-QAOA leverages simulated annealing-based graph reduction to create a smaller, distilled graph that retains the essential characteristics of the original graph, thereby reducing the quantum circuit size and noise impact. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical optimization framework that dynamically switches between quantum and classical methods based on problem size and noise levels. Additionally, we investigate adaptive graph reduction techniques that adjust in real-time based on noise measurements and computational constraints. We explore the application of Red-QAOA in quantum machine learning tasks, such as quantum support vector machines and quantum neural networks, and integrate it with quantum error correction techniques to further mitigate noise. Furthermore, we investigate the use of Red-QAOA in optimizing quantum communication networks, focusing on maintaining high-fidelity quantum information transfer and optimizing network topologies and routing protocols.\n\n**PolyFormer**: We introduce PolyFormer, a scalable node-wise filter for spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that leverages the attention mechanism to learn node-wise filters efficiently. PolyFormer is designed to handle large-scale graphs, capturing spectral information while maintaining scalability and expressiveness. We explore the application of PolyFormer in multimodal graphs, combining different types of data such as text and images, and develop a dynamic version that adapts to evolving graphs in real-time. We investigate the use of PolyFormer in graph-based reinforcement learning tasks to optimize decision-making processes in environments represented as graphs, such as traffic networks or robotic navigation. Additionally, we develop a variant of PolyFormer specifically designed for graph anomaly detection tasks and a real-time social network analysis tool to detect and analyze dynamic changes in social networks.\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Red-QAOA significantly reduces node and edge counts while maintaining low mean square error, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN-based pooling techniques. PolyFormer shows superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, handling graphs containing up to 100 million nodes. Our findings highlight the potential of Red-QAOA and PolyFormer in addressing complex graph-based challenges, providing robust and scalable solutions for quantum and classical graph-based optimization and learning tasks.",
