    "weakness": "### Weaknesses Summary\n\n1. **Complexity and Practicality of Quantum Integration**: \n   - The integration of quantum optimization techniques with classical GNN architectures is innovative but faces practical challenges. The current state of quantum hardware limits the feasibility of deploying such hybrid models in real-world scenarios. The paper does not sufficiently address these limitations or provide a clear path for practical implementation with existing quantum technology.\n\n2. **Scalability Claims**: \n   - While the paper claims significant improvements in scalability, the experiments are limited to datasets with up to 100 million nodes. There is a need for a more comprehensive evaluation on even larger datasets or a detailed analysis of the model's performance as the dataset size increases beyond this threshold.\n\n3. **Comparative Baseline Models**: \n   - The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art GNN models that also aim to address scalability and adaptability issues. Including a broader set of baseline models in the experimental evaluation would strengthen the claims of superior performance.\n\n4. **Graph Reduction Techniques**: \n   - The effectiveness of the Red-QAOA technique in reducing graph size and minimizing noise is highlighted, but the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how this reduction impacts the overall graph structure and the quality of the learned representations. More insights into the trade-offs involved in graph reduction would be valuable.\n\n5. **Generalization to Diverse Graph Types**: \n   - While the model shows superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, the paper does not explore the generalization capabilities of the proposed approach across a wider variety of graph types and structures. Additional experiments on diverse graph datasets would help validate the robustness of the model.\n\n6. **Attention Mechanism in PolyFormer**: \n   - The use of an attention mechanism for node-wise filters in PolyFormer is a key contribution, but the paper does not provide a detailed ablation study to isolate the impact of this component. Understanding the specific contribution of the attention mechanism to the overall performance would be beneficial.\n\n7. **Reproducibility and Code Availability**: \n   - While the code for PolyFormer is made available, the paper does not provide sufficient details on the experimental setup, hyperparameter tuning, and computational resources used. This lack of detail may hinder the reproducibility of the results and the ability of other researchers to build upon this work.\n\n8. **Theoretical Justification**: \n   - The paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical foundation or justification for the proposed hybrid Quantum-Classical GNN model"
