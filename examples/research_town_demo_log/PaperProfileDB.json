    "title": "Transformer Circuit Faithfulness Metrics are not Robust",
    "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability work attempts to reverse engineer the learned algorithms present inside neural networks. One focus of this work has been to discover 'circuits' -- subgraphs of the full model that explain behaviour on specific tasks. But how do we measure the performance of such circuits? Prior work has attempted to measure circuit 'faithfulness' -- the degree to which the circuit replicates the performance of the full model. In this work, we survey many considerations for designing experiments that measure circuit faithfulness by ablating portions of the model's computation. Concerningly, we find existing methods are highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in the ablation methodology. We conclude that existing circuit faithfulness scores reflect both the methodological choices of researchers as well as the actual components of the circuit - the task a circuit is required to perform depends on the ablation used to test it. The ultimate goal of mechanistic interpretability work is to understand neural networks, so we emphasize the need for more clarity in the precise claims being made about circuits. We open source a library at https://github.com/UFO-101/auto-circuit that includes highly efficient implementations of a wide range of ablation methodologies and circuit discovery algorithms.",

    "title": "Evaluating Deep Neural Networks in Deployment (A Comparative and Replicability Study)",
    "abstract": "As deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, there is a growing concern for their reliability. Even highly trained, high-performant networks are not 100% accurate. However, it is very difficult to predict their behavior during deployment without ground truth. In this paper, we provide a comparative and replicability study on recent approaches that have been proposed to evaluate the reliability of DNNs in deployment. We find that it is hard to run and reproduce the results for these approaches on their replication packages and even more difficult to run them on artifacts other than their own. Further, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of the approaches, due to the lack of clearly defined evaluation metrics. Our results indicate that more effort is needed in our research community to obtain sound techniques for evaluating the reliability of neural networks in safety-critical domains. To this end, we contribute an evaluation framework that incorporates the considered approaches and enables evaluation on common benchmarks, using common metrics.",

    "abstract": "Building upon the statistical formulation for parameter estimation in the presence of correlated noise proposed by Cireddu et al., we present an initial study to incorporate the effects of correlated noise into the analyses of various detector designs' performance. We consider a two L-shaped detector configuration located in the European Union, and compare the expectation of parameter estimation between the non-colocated and a hypothetical colocated configurations. In our study, we posit the existence of low-frequency correlated noise within the $5\\text{ Hz}$ to $10\\text{ Hz}$ range for the colocated detector configuration, with a varying degree of correlation. In this specific detector setup, our observations indicate an enhancement in the precision of intrinsic parameter measurements as the degree of correlation increases. This trend suggests that higher degrees of noise correlation may beneficially influence the accuracy of parameter estimation. In particular, when the noise is highly correlated, the uncertainty on chirp mass decreases by up to $30\\%$. The absence of an inter-European baseline does hinder the estimation of the extrinsic parameters. However, given a realistic global network with the additional detector located in the United States, the uncertainty of extrinsic parameters is significantly reduced. This reduction is further amplified as the degree of noise correlation increases. When noise correlation exceeds a certain level, the colocated configuration outperforms the non-colocated one, reducing the $90\\%$ credible area of sky location by up to $10\\%$. We conclude that noise correlation significantly impacts detector performance, potentially altering both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. Thus, we recommend including noise correlation in comprehensive assessments of third-generation gravitational wave detector designs.",

    "title": "Topological Generalization Bounds for Discrete-Time Stochastic Optimization Algorithms",
    "abstract": "We present a novel set of rigorous and computationally efficient topology-based complexity notions that exhibit a strong correlation with the generalization gap in modern deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures correlate highly with generalization error in industry-standards architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures.",

    "title": "Unifying 3D Representation and Control of Diverse Robots with a Single Camera",
    "abstract": "Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Modern fabrication techniques have dramatically expanded feasible hardware, yet deploying these systems requires control software to translate desired motions into actuator commands. While conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected via joints, it remains an open challenge to model and control bio-inspired robots that are often multi-material or soft, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce Neural Jacobian Fields, an architecture that autonomously learns to model and control robots from vision alone. Our approach makes no assumptions about the robot's materials, actuation, or sensing, requires only a single camera for control, and learns to control the robot without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators, varying in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. By enabling robot control with a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate our work will dramatically broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.",

    "abstract": "Traversability estimation in rugged, unstructured environments remains a challenging problem in field robotics. Often, the need for precise, accurate traversability estimation is in direct opposition to the limited sensing and compute capability present on affordable, small-scale mobile robots. To address this issue, we present a novel method to learn [u]ncertainty-aware [n]avigation features from high-fidelity scans of [real]-world environments (UNRealNet). This network can be deployed on-robot to predict these high-fidelity features using input from lower-quality sensors. UNRealNet predicts dense, metric-space features directly from single-frame lidar scans, thus reducing the effects of occlusion and odometry error. Our approach is label-free, and is able to produce traversability estimates that are robot-agnostic. Additionally, we can leverage UNRealNet's predictive uncertainty to both produce risk-aware traversability estimates, and refine our feature predictions over time. We find that our method outperforms traditional local mapping and inpainting baselines by up to 40%, and demonstrate its efficacy on multiple legged platforms.",

    "title": "WhisperNetV2: SlowFast Siamese Network For Lip-Based Biometrics",
    "abstract": "Lip-based biometric authentication (LBBA) has attracted many researchers during the last decade. The lip is specifically interesting for biometric researchers because it is a twin biometric with the potential to function both as a physiological and a behavioral trait. Although much valuable research was conducted on LBBA, none of them considered the different emotions of the client during the video acquisition step of LBBA, which can potentially affect the client's facial expressions and speech tempo. We proposed a novel network structure called WhisperNetV2, which extends our previously proposed network called WhisperNet. Our proposed network leverages a deep Siamese structure with triplet loss having three identical SlowFast networks as embedding networks. The SlowFast network is an excellent candidate for our task since the fast pathway extracts motion-related features (behavioral lip movements) with a high frame rate and low channel capacity. The slow pathway extracts visual features (physiological lip appearance) with a low frame rate and high channel capacity. Using an open-set protocol, we trained our network using the CREMA-D dataset and acquired an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.005 on the test set. Considering that the acquired EER is less than most similar LBBA methods, our method can be considered as a state-of-the-art LBBA method.",

    "title": "Sensor-Aware Classifiers for Energy-Efficient Time Series Applications on IoT Devices",
    "abstract": "Time-series data processing is an important component of many real-world applications, such as health monitoring, environmental monitoring, and digital agriculture. These applications collect distinct windows of sensor data (e.g., few seconds) and process them to assess the environment. Machine learning (ML) models are being employed in time-series applications due to their generalization abilities for classification. State-of-the-art time-series applications wait for entire sensor data window to become available before processing the data using ML algorithms, resulting in high sensor energy consumption. However, not all situations require processing full sensor window to make accurate inference. For instance, in activity recognition, sitting and standing activities can be inferred with partial windows. Using this insight, we propose to employ early exit classifiers with partial sensor windows to minimize energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we first utilize multiple early exits with successively increasing amount of data as they become available in a window. If early exits provide inference with high confidence, we return the label and enter low power mode for sensors. The proposed approach has potential to enable significant energy savings in time series applications. We utilize neural networks and random forest classifiers to evaluate our approach. Our evaluations with six datasets show that the proposed approach enables up to 50-60% energy savings on average without any impact on accuracy. The energy savings can enable time-series applications in remote locations with limited energy availability.",

    "abstract": "NextG (5G and beyond) networks, through the increasing integration of cloud/edge computing technologies, are becoming highly distributed compute platforms ideally suited to host emerging resource-intensive and latency-sensitive applications (e.g., industrial automation, extended reality, distributed AI). The end-to-end orchestration of such demanding applications, which involves function/data placement, flow routing, and joint communication/computation/storage resource allocation, requires new models and algorithms able to capture: (i) their disaggregated microservice-based architecture, (ii) their complex processing graph structures, including multiple-input multiple-output processing stages, and (iii) the opportunities for efficiently sharing and replicating data streams that may be useful for multiple functions and/or end users. To this end, we first identify the technical gaps in existing literature that prevent efficiently addressing the optimal orchestration of emerging applications described by information-aware directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We then leverage the recently proposed Cloud Network Flow optimization framework and a novel functionally-equivalent DAG-to-Forest graph transformation procedure to design IDAGO (Information-Aware DAG Orchestration), a polynomial-time multi-criteria approximation algorithm for the optimal orchestration of NextG media services over NextG compute-integrated networks.",

Current methods to estimate curve parameters require large samples; however, obtaining these is often impractical due to experimental constraints. Here, we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that accounts for small samples, handles outliers, simulates high-fidelity data, and returns a posterior distribution over curve parameters that quantify estimation uncertainty. It uses a rectified-logistic function that estimates motor threshold and outperforms conventionally used sigmoidal alternatives in predictive performance, as demonstrated through cross-validation. In simulations, our method outperforms non-hierarchical models by reducing threshold estimation error on sparse data and requires fewer participants to detect shifts in threshold compared to frequentist testing. We present two common use cases involving electrical and electromagnetic stimulation data and provide an open-source library for Python, called hbMEP, for diverse applications.",
