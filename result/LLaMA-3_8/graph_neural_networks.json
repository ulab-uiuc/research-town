We believe that the paper's strength lies in its ability to spark new research directions and collaborations across disciplines.\n\nRegarding the suggestion to provide concrete results and experimental evidence, we agree that this is an important aspect of the paper. However, we would like to point out that the paper is not a traditional research paper that presents a specific experiment or simulation. Instead, it is a conceptual paper that aims to explore the potential connections and applications of different fields. We believe that the paper's ideas and concepts are valuable in their own right, and that they have the potential to lead to breakthroughs in sensing, communication, and materials science.\n\n**Response to Reviewer 2:**\n\nI understand the reviewer's concerns regarding the paper's scope and the lack of connections between the different topics. However, I would like to argue that the paper's scope is not overly ambitious, but rather, it is a reflection of the rapidly evolving nature of the fields of condensed matter physics, computer science, and engineering. The paper's connections between hyperbolic plasmonic media, graph neural networks, and millimeter wave/terahertz communication are not meant to be fully developed in this paper, but rather, they are intended to spark new research directions and collaborations.\n\nRegarding the suggestion to focus on a specific area, we agree that this is a viable approach. However, we believe that the paper's strength lies in its ability to present a broad range of novel ideas and applications, and that focusing on a specific area would limit the paper's potential impact.\n\n**Response to Reviewer 3:**\n\nI appreciate the reviewer's positive comments on the paper's potential to make a significant impact in the fields of sensing, communication, and materials science. I would like to address the concerns regarding the connections between the different topics. While it is true that the paper does not fully develop the connections between hyperbolic plasmonic media, graph neural networks, and millimeter wave/terahertz communication, we believe that the paper's ideas and concepts are valuable in their own right,Here is a rebuttal to the reviews:\n\nWe appreciate the reviewers' feedback and acknowledge the concerns raised. However, we would like to address each of the points made and provide a rebuttal to demonstrate why we believe our paper deserves acceptance.\n\n**Lack of concrete results:**\n\nWhile it is true that our paper does not provide concrete results in the classical sense, we believe that the novelty and potential impact of our ideas justify the lack of experimental evidence at this stage. Our paper is a conceptual framework that aims to spark new research directions and collaborations between experts from different fields. We are not claiming to have solved a specific problem or achieved a particular result, but rather to have identified new opportunities for interdisciplinary research. We believe that the reviewers' expectations of concrete results are too narrow and do not account for the innovative nature of our work.\n\n**Overly ambitious scope:**\n\nWe understand that our paper attempts to cover a wide range of topics, but we believe that this is a strength rather than a weakness. By exploring the connections between hyperbolic plasmonic media, graph neural networks, and millimeter wave/terahertz communication, we are able to identify new opportunities for innovation and collaboration that might not have been possible within a single field. We are not trying to provide a comprehensive treatment of each area, but rather to demonstrate the potential for interdisciplinary research to drive breakthroughs. We believe that the reviewers' suggestion to focus on a specific area is too limiting and would result in a narrower, less innovative paper.\n\n**Limited connections between topics:**\n\nWe acknowledge that the connections between our topics may not be immediately clear, but we believe that this is a result of the reviewers' lack of familiarity with the specific areas we are discussing. We have provided explicit explanations of how our ideas relate to each other, and we believe that the reviewers have not given us sufficient credit for the novelty and creativity of our approach. We are willing to provide additional explanations and examples to help clarify the connections between our topics.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewers' suggestions, but we believe that they are too focused on traditional notions of what constitutes a \"good\" paper. We are not trying to write a traditional research paper, but rather to create a new paradigm for interdisciplinary research. We believe that our paper has the potential to inspire new research directions and collaborations, and that the reviewers' expectations of concrete results and a narrow focus are too limiting.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that our paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field and that the reviewers", "meta_reviews": "Based on the reviews and rebuttals, I would make the following decision:\n\n**Acceptance**\n\nWhile the reviewers have raised some valid concerns, I believe that the authors have effectively addressed these concerns in their rebuttals.
