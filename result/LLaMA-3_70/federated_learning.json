However, existing CAD systems often rely on single imaging modalities, neglecting the wealth of information available from multiple modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages graph-based representation learning to fuse information from multiple imaging modalities, such as MRI, CT, and X-ray. Our approach, inspired by recent advances in graph external attention mechanisms, enables the selective weighting of different modalities for a given diagnosis task. Furthermore, we integrate explainable AI techniques to provide interpretable insights into the decision-making process, generating visual explanations and saliency maps to highlight the most relevant features contributing to a diagnosis. Our approach has the potential to improve diagnosis accuracy and robustness, while also providing clinicians with a deeper understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.
