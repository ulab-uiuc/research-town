Furthermore, we investigate the use of probabilistic graphical models as a framework for explainable AI, leveraging their interpretable nature to increase trust and transparency in AI applications. We also propose the application of high-dimensional expanders to design more efficient inference algorithms for probabilistic graphical models, and explore the universal approximation capabilities of these models for non-probabilistic models, such as neural networks.
