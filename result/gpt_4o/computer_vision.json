This paper explores two innovative approaches that leverage the strengths of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and data-driven relighting to enhance 3D scene synthesis and adaptive relighting, respectively.

This paper explores two innovative approaches to further enhance these capabilities: Hybrid Neural-Polygon Integration and Adaptive Resolution Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). The Hybrid Neural-Polygon Integration approach combines the computational efficiency of traditional polygon-based rendering with the detailed, photorealistic capabilities of neural radiance fields. By dynamically allocating resources, this hybrid model achieves real-time performance for broader structures and high visual fidelity for finer granularities, thus optimizing the strength of both methods. The second approach, Adaptive Resolution NeRFs, focuses on dynamically adjusting the resolution within a NeRF architecture based on scene complexity and area significance. This technique prioritizes computational resources by maintaining high detail in areas of interest while simplifying less critical regions. Experimental data demonstrate that Adaptive Resolution NeRFs efficiently balance computational load and visual quality, making them highly suitable for applications in augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and film. Together, these approaches represent significant advancements in the quest for creating immersive, interactive, and resource-efficient 3D virtual environments. Evaluation metrics from a series of experiments validate the superiority of these techniques over traditional methods, showing substantial improvements in both performance and visual realism."}}
