You have proposed novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words, automated the process of generating and extending dictionaries and phrase tables for machine translation, and explored the potential of self-training models on their own outputs. Additionally, you have introduced the concept of 'thinking tokens' to enhance the generalization capability of language models.\n2. **Artificial Life**: You have contributed to the field of artificial life by introducing Combinatory Chemistry, an Algorithmic Artificial Chemistry based on a minimalistic computational paradigm named Combinatory Logic. This system discovers a wide range of emergent patterns that are remarkably similar to biological metabolisms. You have also presented a novel classification method for deterministic discrete space and time dynamical systems, which distinguishes between different asymptotic behaviors of a system's average computation time before entering a loop.\n2. **Graph Neural Networks**: The recent paper on material design utilizes graph neural networks to explore the global chemical space and generate promising structures with high activity.
