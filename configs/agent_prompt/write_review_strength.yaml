- "Here is the proposal: Our research introduces a novel explainable AI framework called XAI-Viz, designed to improve transparency in deep learning models used for medical image analysis. XAI-Viz generates visual explanations that highlight which parts of an image contributed to the model's decision, allowing clinicians to better understand the model’s reasoning process. The system incorporates a saliency mapping technique and a gradient-based attention mechanism to produce clear and interpretable visualizations. In a series of tests on medical imaging datasets, XAI-Viz consistently produced explanations that aligned well with expert annotations, demonstrating its potential to improve trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

  Here is the summary of the paper: This paper introduces XAI-Viz, a framework aimed at enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models applied in medical image analysis. XAI-Viz generates visual explanations using saliency mapping and gradient-based attention, offering clinicians insights into how the model arrives at its decisions. The framework was evaluated on medical imaging datasets, and its explanations were found to align with expert opinions, suggesting that XAI-Viz can increase trust in AI-driven diagnostic tools by providing transparency and clarity.
