- "Here is the proposal: We present a novel deep learning architecture, TransformerX, for natural language processing tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while requiring significantly less computational resources than existing models. TransformerX incorporates a new attention mechanism and sparse activation function, enabling efficient processing of long sequences. We demonstrate its effectiveness on tasks including machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis, consistently outperforming current leading models while using 30% less computing power and memory.

- "Summary: This paper introduces TransformerX, an innovative deep learning architecture for natural language processing. The model's key features include a novel attention mechanism and sparse activation function, which enable it to process long sequences more efficiently. TransformerX achieves state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. Notably, it accomplishes this while using 30% less computational resources compared to existing top-performing models, addressing the critical issue of efficiency in deep learning approaches for NLP."

- "Here is the proposal: Our research introduces a novel explainable AI framework called XAI-Viz, designed to improve transparency in deep learning models used for medical image analysis. XAI-Viz generates visual explanations that highlight which parts of an image contributed to the model's decision, allowing clinicians to better understand the modelâ€™s reasoning process. The system incorporates a saliency mapping technique and a gradient-based attention mechanism to produce clear and interpretable visualizations. In a series of tests on medical imaging datasets, XAI-Viz consistently produced explanations that aligned well with expert annotations, demonstrating its potential to improve trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

- "Summary: This paper introduces XAI-Viz, a framework aimed at enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models applied in medical image analysis. XAI-Viz generates visual explanations using saliency mapping and gradient-based attention, offering clinicians insights into how the model arrives at its decisions. The framework was evaluated on medical imaging datasets, and its explanations were found to align with expert opinions, suggesting that XAI-Viz can increase trust in AI-driven diagnostic tools by providing transparency and clarity."
