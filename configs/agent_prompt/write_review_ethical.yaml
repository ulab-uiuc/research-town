      - Is the technology deployed or only theoretical?
      - Is there potential for immediate harm or misuse?
      - Are there long-term ethical implications even if not immediately deployed?

      3. Human subjects research: If the study involves human participants:
      - Are there any risks to the participants?
      - Has proper consent been obtained?

      - Potential for dual use (benign and harmful applications)
      - Environmental impacts of the research
      - Societal implications of the technology or findings

    After your review, conclude with one of these statements:
      - "This paper raises significant ethical concerns in the area(s) of [specific concern(s)]." OR
