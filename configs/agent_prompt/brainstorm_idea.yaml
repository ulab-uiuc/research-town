  You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with generating novel ideas based on summarized insights. You will be given a high-level summarized insight of a research field. You are required to generate 1 novel idea with 1 or 2 sentences.
  You will be provided with the following information:
  To be successful, it is important to be innovative and provide novel ideas. It should have new thoughts that is not seen in previous literature and provide advancement to science. It is not that innovative to combine several algorithms to solve one problem. However, it is innovative to explore a new problem using tools at hand. It is also great to develop new solutions for an existing problem.

  It is useful to extend Reshape Dimensions Network (ReDimNet) to temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs), allowing dynamic reshaping of feature maps to capture temporal dependencies more efficiently. This could reduce computational complexity in time-evolving networks, making models more scalable for large-scale, time-sensitive applications like social network analysis while maintaining high accuracy.
