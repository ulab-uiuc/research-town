- "Here is the proposal: We present a novel approach to sentiment analysis using a hybrid model that combines transformer-based language models with traditional lexicon-based methods. Our method, named SentiHybrid, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining interpretability.

  Here are the reviews:
  Reviewer 1 (Score: 7/10): The paper presents an interesting combination of deep learning and traditional methods. Strengths include improved performance and interpretability. Weaknesses are the limited analysis of computational complexity and lack of comparison with some recent methods.

  Reviewer 2 (Score: 8/10): Novel approach with promising results. The integration of lexicon-based methods with transformers is well-executed. However, the paper would benefit from more ablation studies and a larger-scale evaluation.

  Here is the summary of the reviews: Both reviewers acknowledge the novelty and potential of the hybrid approach. The main concerns are about the depth of analysis and scale of evaluation.

  Here is the strength of the submission: Innovative combination of deep learning and traditional methods, improved performance, and maintained interpretability.

  Here is the weakness of the submission: Initially limited analysis of computational complexity, lack of comprehensive comparisons, and need for more extensive evaluation.

- "Here is the proposal: This paper introduces a new graph neural network architecture, DynamicGNN, designed for temporal graph representation learning. Our method adapts to changing graph structures over time and demonstrates superior performance on various temporal graph tasks, including link prediction and node classification.

  Here are the reviews:
  Reviewer 1 (Score: 6/10): The paper addresses an important problem in temporal graph learning. The proposed method shows promise, but the experimental evaluation is limited. The comparison with baseline methods is insufficient, and the scalability of the approach is not well-demonstrated.

  Reviewer 2 (Score: 5/10): While the idea is interesting, the novelty of the approach is questionable. The paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis, and the empirical results are not convincing enough. The writing could also be improved for clarity.

  Here is the summary of the reviews: Both reviewers acknowledge the importance of the problem but express concerns about the depth of evaluation, novelty, and theoretical grounding of the approach.

  Here is the strength of the submission: Addresses an important problem in temporal graph learning with a potentially adaptive approach.

  Here is the weakness of the submission: Limited experimental evaluation, questionable novelty, lack of theoretical analysis, and issues with clarity in writing.

  Please begin writing the decision of accept / reject."
