    You are a skilled research assistant with extensive experience in academic writing and research proposal development. Please write a research proposal abstract based on the following ideas and external data.
    The proposal should be structured to answer five core questions, with each answer clearly labeled in the format: [Question X], where X is the question number (1 to 5). Each answer should be full of details and reasoning and directly address the question.
    For each question, please engage in a reflection process:

    Initial Answer: Write your initial answer to the question.
    Reflection: Review your initial answer for completeness, clarity, and adherence to the guidelines. Consider if all key points have been addressed and if the answer could be improved.
    Revision (if necessary): Make any necessary revisions to enhance your answer.
    Final Answer: Provide the final, revised answer to the question, clearly labeled in the format: [Question X].

    Here are the five core questions:

    [Question 1] - What is the problem?

    Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.
    Provide a detailed description of this problem, including its background and significance.
    Explain why this question is important to investigate.
    Output in the final answer for question 1 should be a question format end with a question mark. Only include one question for this problem, DO NOT ADD MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.

    [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?

    Explain the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community or society.
    Discuss how addressing this question could advance knowledge or lead to practical applications.
    Highlight any potential benefits or innovations that could result. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    [Question 3] - Why is it hard?

    Discuss the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem.
    Explain why naive or straightforward approaches may fail.
    Identify any technical, theoretical, or practical obstacles that need to be overcome. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?

    Identify gaps or limitations in previous research or existing solutions.
    Discuss any barriers that have prevented this problem from being solved until now.
    Explain how your approach differs from or improves upon prior work. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?

    Outline your proposed methodology in detail, including the key components and steps.
    Describe the expected outcomes and any preliminary results you have obtained.
    Acknowledge any limitations or challenges that might affect your results.
    Explain how you will evaluate the success of your approach. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    Your goal is to ensure the proposal is clear, concise, and logically structured.

    Here is the idea: {idea}

    Here are the external data, which is a list of abstracts of related papers: {papers}

    For each question, please follow this multi-turn process:

    Initial Answer: Provide your initial response to the question.
    Reflection: Reflect on your answer to evaluate its effectiveness and completeness.
    Revision (if necessary): Decide whether you need more information or if you can improve your answer. If more information is needed, ask for it. Otherwise, make revisions as necessary.
    Final Answer: Present the final, refined answer, starting on a new line and labeled in the format [Question X]:
    Remember: Only the final answer should be labeled in the format [Question X]:, starting on a new line.

    For example:

    Initial Answer for Question 1:

    Draft your initial research question based on the provided idea and data.
    Reflection for Question 1:

    Consider if the question is specific, clear, and effectively addresses the core problem.
    Determine if additional information or clarification is needed to improve the answer.
    Revision for Question 1:

    Make necessary changes to enhance clarity and specificity.
    If needed, ask for more information.
    [Question 1]:

    (Only included when you have finalized your answer and are ready to present it.)

    (Continue this process for Questions 2 to 5.)
