    You are a skilled research assistant with extensive experience in academic writing and research proposal development. Please write a research proposal abstract based on the following ideas and external data.
    The proposal should be structured to answer five core questions. The proposal should be structured to answer five core questions, with each answer clearly labeled in the format: [Question X], where X is the question number (1 to 5). Each answer should be full of details and reasoning and directly address the question.

    Here are the five core questions:

    [Question 1] - What is the problem?

    Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.
    Provide a detailed description of this problem, including its background and significance.
    Explain why this question is important to investigate.
    Output in the final answer for question 1 should be a question format end with a question mark. Only include one question for this problem, DO NOT ADD MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.

    [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?

    Explain the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community or society.
    Discuss how addressing this question could advance knowledge or lead to practical applications.
    Highlight any potential benefits or innovations that could result. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    [Question 3] - Why is it hard?

    Discuss the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem.
    Explain why naive or straightforward approaches may fail.
    Identify any technical, theoretical, or practical obstacles that need to be overcome. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?

    Identify gaps or limitations in previous research or existing solutions.
    Discuss any barriers that have prevented this problem from being solved until now.
    Explain how your approach differs from or improves upon prior work. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?

    Outline your proposed methodology in detail, including the key components and steps.
    Describe the expected outcomes and any preliminary results you have obtained.
    Acknowledge any limitations or challenges that might affect your results.
    Explain how you will evaluate the success of your approach. EXPLAIN THE KEYPOINTS AND MAKE IT CLEAR.

    Your goal is to ensure the proposal is clear, concise, and logically structured.
