  Here is the personal profile: I am a machine learning researcher focused on neural networks, generative models, and optimization. I’ve contributed to understanding inferential complexity in VAEs, the dynamics of SGD, and continual learning to prevent catastrophic forgetting. My work also improves training methods, develops syntax-aware NLP models, and offers solutions for generative modeling challenges like normalizing flows and exact sampling.

  Here is the target paper: Introduction Learning low-dimensional vector representations of nodes ingraphs (Hamilton et al., 2017b) has led to advances on taskssuch as node classiﬁcation (Kipf & Welling, 2017), linkprediction (Grover & Leskovec, 2016), graph classiﬁcation(Ying et al., 2018b) and graph generation (You et al., 2018b),with successful applications across domains such as socialand information networks (Ying et al., 2018a), chemistry(You et al., 2018a), and biology (Zitnik & Leskovec, 2017).Node embedding methods can be categorized into GraphNeural Networks (GNNs) approaches (Scarselli et al., 2009),1Department of Computer Science, Stanford University,Stanford, CA, USA.

Copyright2019 by the author(s).matrix-factorization approaches (Belkin & Niyogi, 2002),and random-walk approaches (Perozzi et al., 2014). Amongthese, GNNs are currently the most popular paradigm,largely owing to their efﬁciency and inductive learning ca-pability (Hamilton et al., 2017a). By contrast, random-walkapproaches (Perozzi et al., 2014; Grover & Leskovec, 2016)are limited to transductive settings and cannot incorporatenode attributes. In the GNN framework, the embedding of anode is computed by a GNN layer aggregating informationfrom the node’s network neighbors via non-linear transfor-mation and aggregation functions (Battaglia et al., 2018).Long-range node dependencies can be captured via stackingmultiple GNN layers, allowing the information to propagatefor multiple-hops (Xu et al., 2018).However, the key limitation of existing GNN architecturesis that they fail to capture the position/location of the nodewithin the broader context of the graph structure. For exam-ple, if two nodes reside in very different parts of the graphbut have topologically the same (local) neighbourhood struc-ture, they will have identical GNN structure. Therefore, theGNN will embed them to the same point in the embeddingspace (we ignore node attributes for now). Figure 1 gives anexample where a GNN cannot distinguish between nodesv1andv2and will always embed them to the same point be-cause they have isomorphic network neighborhoods. Thus,GNNs will never be able to classify nodes v1andv2into dif-ferent classes because from the GNN point of view they areindistinguishable (again, not considering node attributes).Researchers have spotted this weakness (Xu et al., 2019)and developed heuristics to ﬁx the issue: augmenting nodefeatures with one-hot encodings (Kipf & Welling, 2017),or making GNNs deeper (Selsam et al., 2019). However,models trained with one-hot encodings cannot generalizeto unseen graphs, and arbitrarily deep GNNs still cannotdistinguish structurally isomorphic nodes (Figure 1).Here we propose Position-aware Graph Neural Networks(P-GNNs) , a new class of Graph Neural Networks for com-puting node embeddings that incorporate a node’s positionalinformation with respect to all other nodes in the network,while also retaining inductive capability and utilizing nodefeatures. Our key observation is that node position can becaptured by a low-distortion embedding by quantifying thedistance between a given node and a set of anchor nodes.Speciﬁcally, P-GNN uses a sampling strategy with theoreti-arXiv:1906.04817v2  [cs.LG]  13 Jun 2019Position-aware Graph Neural NetworksFigure 1.

(Note we do not consider node features.)Each node is labeled based on its label AorB, and effective nodeembedding should be able to learn to distinguish nodes v1andv2(that is, embed them

  Develop a Position-aware Graph Neural Network (P-GNN) framework that integrates fairness constraints and reinforcement learning to enhance causal inference and event knowledge extraction in complex graphical models. This framework will leverage positional information to improve the identification of causal relationships while ensuring equitable treatment of diverse groups in sensitive applications such as social networks and healthcare. By dynamically optimizing anchor node selection through reinforcement learning, the model will enhance its adaptability and accuracy in classifying structured events within noisy natural language datasets. Additionally, it will incorporate local differential privacy techniques to protect individual data, promoting fairness across distributed graph structures in federated learning settings while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts.
