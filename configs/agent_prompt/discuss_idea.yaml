- "Here are the research ideas:
It is useful to extend Reshape Dimensions Network (ReDimNet) to temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs), allowing dynamic reshaping of feature maps to capture temporal dependencies more efficiently.

Introduce adaptive feature pooling mechanisms that dynamically adjust the resolution of node embeddings over time, enabling temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) to focus on critical time intervals while reducing unnecessary complexity for periods of lower importance.

Develop a hierarchical attention mechanism for TGNNs, where attention layers operate at multiple temporal scales, allowing the network to focus on both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies in evolving graphs, improving prediction performance on time-sensitive tasks.

Please begin summarizing ideas."
- "The Hierarchical Temporal Attention Mechanism for TGNNs proposes a multi-scale attention framework to better capture short- and long-term temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs. By adjusting attention at different temporal resolutions, this approach improves the model's ability to handle fine-grained details and long-range patterns, enhancing prediction accuracy on tasks like link prediction and event forecasting. This flexible, scalable mechanism reduces complexity while preserving key temporal information, offering a more efficient way to model evolving graphs."
