- "Here is the paper text: Since in context learning is proved to be extremely useful in large language models, we should utilize large scale pretraining to allow the creation of graph foundation model that has the ability to conduct in-context-learning on grpah.

  Here are the reviews: The paper presents an interesting approach, but there are concerns about the novelty of combining graph foundation model with the pretraining. Authors should clarify the difference between their methods and other efforts to use things like mixture-of-expert architecture to train graph foundation models.

  The rebuttal should be structured to answer five core questions, with each answer clearly labeled in the format: [Question X], where X is the question number (1 to 5).

  [Question 1]: Can we design mechanism to enable in context learning over graph?
  [Question 2]: In-context learning is proved to be very useful in large language models. Therefore, extending this capacity to graph foundation model can allow few-shot prompting dramatically and the graphic model can be generalized to multiple domains.
  [Question 3]: The mechanism of in-context learning in LLM is an open question now. To apply it to graph, graph tasks can be highly heterogeneous, making it difficult to design a unified framework that performs well across different graph types. Additionally, graph data lacks a standardized method for task representation across various tasks (e.g., node, edge, or graph-level classification).
  [Question 4]: In-context learning in multiple tasks requires us to have a graph foundation model that has a large amount of data and generalize well on multiple domains. It is hard to achieve. Other methods like using mixture-of-experts to improve the generalization ability of graph foundation model does not directly improve the in-context learning ability. Those work just use more complicated architecture to allow the model fitting into different graph tasks.
  [Question 5]: With the large scale pretraining of MAG240M and Wiki, it proposes a framework called PRODIGY that designs novel pretraining loss to allow in-context learning. Results show that PRODIGY outperforms contrastive pretraining methods by 18% and fine-tuning by 33%, demonstrating its ability to handle novel tasks across unseen graphs effectively.
