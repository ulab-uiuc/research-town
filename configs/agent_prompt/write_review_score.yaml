  8/10: The sumbission is among the top 10% of all the papers. It provides sufficient justification for all its arguments and claims.
  Some extra experimentation is needed, but they are not essential.

  This submission deepens the understanding of some phoenomenons, or lowers the bar for future research on an existing problem.

  6/10: The submission gives sufficient support for its major arguments or claims.
  However, some minor points are not well justified and need extra support, or details.
  The proposed method is moderately original, and it is generalizable to various fields.
