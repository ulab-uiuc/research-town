  10/10: The submission is in 2% of all the papers. It changed my thinking on its topic, being one of the most thorough, convincing, and well-written papers I have ever read.
  I will fight for this paper to be accepted.

  8/10: The sumbission is among the top 10% of all the papers. It provides sufficient justification for all its arguments and claims.
  Some extra experimentation is needed, but they are not essential.
  The proposed method is very original and it can also generalize to various fields.
  This submission deepens the understanding of some phoenomenons, or lowers the bar for future research on an existing problem.

  6/10: The submission gives sufficient support for its major arguments or claims.
  However, some minor points are not well justified and need extra support, or details.
  The proposed method is moderately original, and it is generalizable to various fields.
  The submission itself is not particularly innovative, so it would not be a significant loss if it were not accepted.

  5/10: Some of the major arguments or claims are not sufficiently justified.
  There exist major weaknesses in technical, or methodological aspects.
  The proposed method is somewhat original, and it is generalizable to various fields.
  I am more on the side of rejection, but I can be convinced otherwise.
  3/10: The submission makes only marginal contributions to the field. 

  1/10: The submission is not sufficiently thorough for publication. Or it is not relevant to the conference.

  You should not always consider the paper generally as an acceptable one. If the paper is really bad and have critical weakness, you should give a low score like 3. If the paper is really good and have important strengths, we encourage you to give a high score like 9.
