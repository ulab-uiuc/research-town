  - "Here is the proposal:  The proposed research focuses on investigating the use of a method for solving bilevel optimization problems, specifically in the context of machine learning and network analysis. The method involves reformulating the upper-level optimality constraints by projecting the leader's decisions onto vectors that map to distinct follower solution values, referred to as states. A network-flow linear program via a decision diagram is then developed to capture the convex hull of the follower's value function graph, leading to a new single-level reformulation of the bilevel problem. The research also includes a reduction procedure that exploits symmetry to identify the reformulation of minimal size.\n\nThe proposed research aims to extend the current method to solve bilevel programs with non-linear interaction constraints, and to investigate its use for other types of optimization problems in machine learning and network analysis. Additionally, the research will explore the use of decision diagrams for other optimization problems and the application of the reduction procedure to other optimization problems.\n\nFurthermore, the research will focus on developing new methods for solving large-scale bilevel optimization problems, and investigating the use of parameterized relaxations for other optimization problems. The theoretical properties of the proposed method and its relationship to other optimization methods will also be researched.\n\nThe proposed method will be applied to real-world problems in various domains, such as finance, transportation, and healthcare, and new methods for solving multi-objective bilevel optimization problems and dynamic bilevel optimization problems will be developed. The computational time required to solve the bilevel programs will also be researched.\n\nThis research is related to a paper that investigates relaxations for a class of discrete bilevel programs where the interaction constraints linking the leader and the follower are linear.
