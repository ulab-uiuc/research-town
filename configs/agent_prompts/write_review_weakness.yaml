The paper may benefit from focusing on a few specific areas and providing a more in-depth analysis.\n3. Insufficient Detail: The paper lacks detail on the methodology of the proposed research. For example, the paper does not provide information on the datasets that will be used for benchmarking, the evaluation metrics, or the specifics of the new GNN architecture. The paper needs to provide more detail to allow for a thorough review.\n4. Limited Context: The paper does not provide sufficient context on the current state of the field.
