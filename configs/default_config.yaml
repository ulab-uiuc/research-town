    - "Here are the personas from different times: Learning node embeddings that capture a node's position within the broader graph structure is crucial for many prediction tasks on graphs. However, existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures have limited power in capturing the position/location of a given node with respect to all other nodes of the graph. Here we propose Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNN first samples sets of anchor nodes, computes the distance of a given target node to each anchor-set, and then learns a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation scheme over the anchor-sets. This way P-GNNs can capture positions/locations of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes. P-GNNs have several advantages: they are inductive, scalable, and can incorporate node feature information. We apply P-GNNs to multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community detection. We show that P-GNNs consistently outperform state of the art GNNs, with up to 66% improvement in terms of the ROC AUC score.; Neural networks are often represented as graphs of connections between neurons. However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a \"sweet spot\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.; Message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful modeling framework for relational data. However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d-regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks. Additionally, ID-GNNs demonstrate improved or comparable performance over other task-specific graph networks.; Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to many real-world static graphs. However, the success of static graphs has not fully translated to dynamic graphs due to the limitations in model design, evaluation settings, and training strategies. Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not incorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their performance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect the evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods for dynamic GNNs are not scalable. Here we propose ROLAND, an effective graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. At its core, the ROLAND framework can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs. Our insight is to view the node embeddings at different GNN layers as hierarchical node states and then recurrently update them over time. We then introduce a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that mimics real-world use cases, where GNNs are making predictions and being updated on a rolling basis. Finally, we propose a scalable and efficient training approach for dynamic GNNs via incremental training and meta-learning. We conduct experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future link prediction tasks. Models built using the ROLAND framework achieve on average 62.7% relative mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvement over state-of-the-art baselines under the standard evaluation settings on three datasets. We find state-of-the-art baselines experience out-of-memory errors for larger datasets, while ROLAND can easily scale to dynamic graphs with 56 million edges. After re-implementing these baselines using the ROLAND training strategy, ROLAND models still achieve on average 15.5% relative MRR improvement over the baselines.; The rapid evolution of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has led to a growing number of new architectures as well as novel applications. However, current research focuses on proposing and evaluating specific architectural designs of GNNs, as opposed to studying the more general design space of GNNs that consists of a Cartesian product of different design dimensions, such as the number of layers or the type of the aggregation function. Additionally, GNN designs are often specialized to a single task, yet few efforts have been made to understand how to quickly find the best GNN design for a novel task or a novel dataset. Here we define and systematically study the architectural design space for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different predictive tasks. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) A general GNN design space; (2) a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for a given novel task/dataset, we can quickly identify/transfer the best performing architecture; (3) an efficient and effective design space evaluation method which allows insights to be distilled from a huge number of model-task combinations. Our key results include: (1) A comprehensive set of guidelines for designing well-performing GNNs; (2) while best GNN designs for different tasks vary significantly, the GNN task space allows for transferring the best designs across different tasks; (3) models discovered using our design space achieve state-of-the-art performance. Overall, our work offers a principled and scalable approach to transition from studying individual GNN designs for specific tasks, to systematically studying the GNN design space and the task space. Finally, we release GraphGym, a powerful platform for exploring different GNN designs and tasks. GraphGym features modularized GNN implementation, standardized GNN evaluation, and reproducible and scalable experiment management.; Despite the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), which aims to find the best design, including the architecture of deep networks and hyper-parameters, conventional AutoML methods are computationally expensive and hardly provide insights into the relations of different model design choices. To tackle the challenges, we propose FALCON, an efficient sample-based method to search for the optimal model design. Our key insight is to model the design space of possible model designs as a design graph, where the nodes represent design choices, and the edges denote design similarities. FALCON features 1) a task-agnostic module, which performs message passing on the design graph via a Graph Neural Network (GNN), and 2) a task-specific module, which conducts label propagation of the known model performance information on the design graph. Both modules are combined to predict the design performances in the design space, navigating the search direction. We conduct extensive experiments on 27 node and graph classification tasks from various application domains, and an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We empirically show that FALCON can efficiently obtain the well-performing designs for each task using only 30 explored nodes. Specifically, FALCON has a comparable time cost with the one-shot approaches while achieving an average improvement of 3.3% compared with the best baselines.; A key assumption in multi-task learning is that at the inference time the multi-task model only has access to a given data point but not to the data point's labels from other tasks. This presents an opportunity to extend multi-task learning to utilize data point's labels from other auxiliary tasks, and this way improves performance on the new task. Here we introduce a novel relational multi-task learning setting where we leverage data point labels from auxiliary tasks to make more accurate predictions on the new task. We develop MetaLink, where our key innovation is to build a knowledge graph that connects data points and tasks and thus allows us to leverage labels from auxiliary tasks. The knowledge graph consists of two types of nodes: (1) data nodes, where node features are data embeddings computed by the neural network, and (2) task nodes, with the last layer's weights for each task as node features. The edges in this knowledge graph capture data-task relationships, and the edge label captures the label of a data point on a particular task. Under MetaLink, we reformulate the new task as a link label prediction problem between a data node and a task node. The MetaLink framework provides flexibility to model knowledge transfer from auxiliary task labels to the task of interest. We evaluate MetaLink on 6 benchmark datasets in both biochemical and vision domains. Experiments demonstrate that MetaLink can successfully utilize the relations among different tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods under the proposed relational multi-task learning setting, with up to 27% improvement in ROC AUC.; AutoML has demonstrated remarkable success in finding an effective neural architecture for a given machine learning task defined by a specific dataset and an evaluation metric. However, most present AutoML techniques consider each task independently from scratch, which requires exploring many architectures, leading to high computational cost. Here we propose AutoTransfer, an AutoML solution that improves search efficiency by transferring the prior architectural design knowledge to the novel task of interest. Our key innovation includes a task-model bank that captures the model performance over a diverse set of GNN architectures and tasks, and a computationally efficient task embedding that can accurately measure the similarity among different tasks. Based on the task-model bank and the task embeddings, we estimate the design priors of desirable models of the novel task, by aggregating a similarity-weighted sum of the top-K design distributions on tasks that are similar to the task of interest. The computed design priors can be used with any AutoML search algorithm. We evaluate AutoTransfer on six datasets in the graph machine learning domain. Experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed task embedding can be computed efficiently, and that tasks with similar embeddings have similar best-performing architectures; (ii) AutoTransfer significantly improves search efficiency with the transferred design priors, reducing the number of explored architectures by an order of magnitude. Finally, we release GNN-Bank-101, a large-scale dataset of detailed GNN training information of 120,000 task-model combinations to facilitate and inspire future research."

    - "Here are the personas from different times: We present a study of anonymized data capturing a month of high-level communication activities within the whole of the Microsoft Messenger instant-messaging system. We examine characteristics and patterns that emerge from the collective dynamics of large numbers of people, rather than the actions and characteristics of individuals. The dataset contains summary properties of 30 billion conversations among 240 million people. From the data, we construct a communication graph with 180 million nodes and 1.3 billion undirected edges, creating the largest social network constructed and analyzed to date. We report on multiple aspects of the dataset and synthesized graph. We find that the graph is well-connected and robust to node removal. We investigate on a planetary-scale the oft-cited report that people are separated by ``six degrees of separation'' and find that the average path length among Messenger users is 6.6. We also find that people tend to communicate more with each other when they have similar age, language, and location, and that cross-gender conversations are both more frequent and of longer duration than conversations with the same gender.; Networks arising from social, technological and natural domains exhibit rich connectivity patterns and nodes in such networks are often labeled with attributes or features. We address the question of modeling the structure of networks where nodes have attribute information. We present a Multiplicative Attribute Graph (MAG) model that considers nodes with categorical attributes and models the probability of an edge as the product of individual attribute link formation affinities. We develop a scalable variational expectation maximization parameter estimation method. Experiments show that MAG model reliably captures network connectivity as well as provides insights into how different attributes shape the network structure.; We develop the Latent Multi-group Membership Graph (LMMG) model, a model of networks with rich node feature structure. In the LMMG model, each node belongs to multiple groups and each latent group models the occurrence of links as well as the node feature structure. The LMMG can be used to summarize the network structure, to predict links between the nodes, and to predict missing features of a node. We derive efficient inference and learning algorithms and evaluate the predictive performance of the LMMG on several social and document network datasets.; Large scale real-world network data such as social and information networks are ubiquitous. The study of such social and information networks seeks to find patterns and explain their emergence through tractable models. In most networks, and especially in social networks, nodes have a rich set of attributes (e.g., age, gender) associated with them.   Here we present a model that we refer to as the Multiplicative Attribute Graphs (MAG), which naturally captures the interactions between the network structure and the node attributes. We consider a model where each node has a vector of categorical latent attributes associated with it. The probability of an edge between a pair of nodes then depends on the product of individual attribute-attribute affinities. The model yields itself to mathematical analysis and we derive thresholds for the connectivity and the emergence of the giant connected component, and show that the model gives rise to networks with a constant diameter. We analyze the degree distribution to show that MAG model can produce networks with either log-normal or power-law degree distributions depending on certain conditions.; Large-scale image retrieval benchmarks invariably consist of images from the Web. Many of these benchmarks are derived from online photo sharing networks, like Flickr, which in addition to hosting images also provide a highly interactive social community. Such communities generate rich metadata that can naturally be harnessed for image classification and retrieval. Here we study four popular benchmark datasets, extending them with social-network metadata, such as the groups to which each image belongs, the comment thread associated with the image, who uploaded it, their location, and their network of friends. Since these types of data are inherently relational, we propose a model that explicitly accounts for the interdependencies between images sharing common properties. We model the task as a binary labeling problem on a network, and use structured learning techniques to learn model parameters. We find that social-network metadata are useful in a variety of classification tasks, in many cases outperforming methods based on image content.; People's personal social networks are big and cluttered, and currently there is no good way to automatically organize them. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g. 'circles' on Google+, and 'lists' on Facebook and Twitter), however they are laborious to construct and must be updated whenever a user's network grows. In this paper, we study the novel task of automatically identifying users' social circles. We pose this task as a multi-membership node clustering problem on a user's ego-network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles. Experiments show that our model accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google+, and Twitter, for all of which we obtain hand-labeled ground-truth.; Recommending products to consumers means not only understanding their tastes, but also understanding their level of experience. For example, it would be a mistake to recommend the iconic film Seven Samurai simply because a user enjoys other action movies; rather, we might conclude that they will eventually enjoy it -- once they are ready. The same is true for beers, wines, gourmet foods -- or any products where users have acquired tastes: the `best' products may not be the most `accessible'. Thus our goal in this paper is to recommend products that a user will enjoy now, while acknowledging that their tastes may have changed over time, and may change again in the future. We model how tastes change due to the very act of consuming more products -- in other words, as users become more experienced. We develop a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience. We find that such a model not only leads to better recommendations, but also allows us to study the role of user experience and expertise on a novel dataset of fifteen million beer, wine, food, and movie reviews.; Relational data-like graphs, networks, and matrices-is often dynamic, where the relational structure evolves over time. A fundamental problem in the analysis of time-varying network data is to extract a summary of the common structure and the dynamics of the underlying relations between the entities. Here we build on the intuition that changes in the network structure are driven by the dynamics at the level of groups of nodes. We propose a nonparametric multi-group membership model for dynamic networks. Our model contains three main components: We model the birth and death of individual groups with respect to the dynamics of the network structure via a distance dependent Indian Buffet Process. We capture the evolution of individual node group memberships via a Factorial Hidden Markov model. And, we explain the dynamics of the network structure by explicitly modeling the connectivity structure of groups. We demonstrate our model's capability of identifying the dynamics of latent groups in a number of different types of network data. Experimental results show that our model provides improved predictive performance over existing dynamic network models on future network forecasting and missing link prediction.; Online crowdfunding platforms like DonorsChoose.org and Kickstarter allow specific projects to get funded by targeted contributions from a large number of people. Critical for the success of crowdfunding communities is recruitment and continued engagement of donors. With donor attrition rates above 70%, a significant challenge for online crowdfunding platforms as well as traditional offline non-profit organizations is the problem of donor retention.   We present a large-scale study of millions of donors and donations on DonorsChoose.org, a crowdfunding platform for education projects. Studying an online crowdfunding platform allows for an unprecedented detailed view of how people direct their donations. We explore various factors impacting donor retention which allows us to identify different groups of donors and quantify their propensity to return for subsequent donations. We find that donors are more likely to return if they had a positive interaction with the receiver of the donation. We also show that this includes appropriate and timely recognition of their support as well as detailed communication of their impact. Finally, we discuss how our findings could inform steps to improve donor retention in crowdfunding communities and non-profit organizations.; Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node classification but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information. However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relation between LPA and GCN has not yet been investigated. Here we study the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of two aspects: (1) feature/label smoothing where we analyze how the feature/label of one node is spread over its neighbors; And, (2) feature/label influence of how much the initial feature/label of one node influences the final feature/label of another node. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node classification. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that lead to improved classification performance. Our model can also be seen as learning attention weights based on node labels, which is more task-oriented than existing feature-based attention models. In a number of experiments on real-world graphs, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art GCN-based methods in terms of node classification accuracy."

These advancements have proven successful in addressing sequential decision-making tasks. However, constructing effective QRL models demands significant expertise due to challenges in designing quantum circuit architectures, including data encoding and parameterized circuits, which profoundly influence model performance. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge with differentiable quantum architecture search (DiffQAS), enabling trainable circuit parameters and structure weights using gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, we enhance training efficiency through asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) methods facilitating parallel training. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed DiffQAS-QRL approach achieves performance comparable to manually-crafted circuit architectures across considered environments, showcasing stability across diverse scenarios. This methodology offers a pathway for designing QRL models without extensive quantum knowledge, ensuring robust performance and fostering broader application of QRL.Paper: We investigate relaxations for a class of discrete bilevel programs where the interaction constraints linking the leader and the follower are linear.

My research has made significant contributions to the understanding of networks in social, technological, and natural domains, with a particular emphasis on incorporating attribute information into network models.\n\nIn my work on structural feature correlation analysis in geometric graphs, I introduced graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional space to explore preliminary results on structural feature correlation. I showed that there exists high correlation between some of the structural features, and that an irredundant feature combination with initial node features, filtered by a graph neural network, can improve classification accuracy in graph-based tasks. I also compared differences between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings between features and showed that the simplest is the best. I generalized these results on synthetic geometric graphs and certified their validity on prediction difficulty between structural features.\n\nIn my research on temporal graphs, I proposed a novel approach called Temporal Motifs Explainer (TempME) to uncover the most pivotal temporal motifs guiding the prediction of temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). TempME extracts the most interaction-related motifs while minimizing the amount of contained information to preserve the sparsity and succinctness of the explanation. I showed that TempME provides more understandable insights and improves the prediction accuracy of current TGNNs.\n\nI have also worked on developing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs. I have shown that HGCN leads to improved performance compared to Euclidean analogs, even with very low dimensional embeddings.\n\nIn addition to my work on network analysis, I have also applied machine learning techniques to the problem of large-scale image retrieval, extending benchmark datasets with social-network metadata and proposing a model that explicitly accounts for the interdependencies between images sharing common properties.

Our findings also highlight the correlation between the quality of relaxations and the properties of the interaction matrix, underscoring the potential of our approach in enhancing solution methods for structured bilevel optimization instances.Paper: In this paper, we present Reshape Dimensions Network (ReDimNet), a novel neural network architecture for extracting utterance-level speaker representations. Our approach leverages dimensionality reshaping of 2D feature maps to 1D signal representation and vice versa, enabling the joint usage of 1D and 2D blocks. We propose an original network topology that preserves the volume of channel-timestep-frequency outputs of 1D and 2D blocks, facilitating efficient residual feature maps aggregation. Moreover, ReDimNet is efficiently scalable, and we introduce a range of model sizes, varying from 1 to 15 M parameters and from 0.5 to 20 GMACs. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReDimNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in speaker recognition while reducing computational complexity and the number of model parameters."

These advancements have proven successful in addressing sequential decision-making tasks. However, constructing effective QRL models demands significant expertise due to challenges in designing quantum circuit architectures, including data encoding and parameterized circuits, which profoundly influence model performance. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge with differentiable quantum architecture search (DiffQAS), enabling trainable circuit parameters and structure weights using gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, we enhance training efficiency through asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) methods facilitating parallel training. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed DiffQAS-QRL approach achieves performance comparable to manually-crafted circuit architectures across considered environments, showcasing stability across diverse scenarios. This methodology offers a pathway for designing QRL models without extensive quantum knowledge, ensuring robust performance and fostering broader application of QRL."

The research will investigate the use of structural feature correlation analysis in predicting missing attribute information in incomplete networks and compare its performance to other attribute prediction methods.

Machine learning techniques will be applied to community detection and network alignment problems, and their performance will be compared to other community detection and network alignment methods. The use of dimensionality reshaping in other neural network architectures, such as CNNs or RNNs, and tasks, such as image classification or natural language processing, will also be explored. New methods for solving bilevel optimization problems, particularly in the context of structured instances, will be developed by incorporating machine learning techniques.

The research will investigate the use of P-GNNs for predicting missing links in incomplete networks and compare their performance to other link prediction methods. Additionally, the research will explore the use of ID-GNNs for improving the expressive power of other GNN architectures and compare their performance on various machine learning tasks. The research will also apply GNNs to other types of dynamic graphs, such as time-varying graphs, and compare their performance to other dynamic graph representation learning methods. Furthermore, the research will investigate the use of GNNs for clustering and dimensionality reduction tasks and compare their performance to other clustering and dimensionality reduction methods. The research will also explore the use of hypergraphs for machine learning tasks and compare their performance to other graph-based representations. Additionally, the research will investigate the use of GNNs for time-series data and text data and compare their performance to other time-series and text analysis methods. The research will develop new methods for training GNNs, such as DiffQAS, that improve their performance and robustness on various machine learning tasks. Furthermore, the research will investigate the use of GNNs for other types of optimization problems, such as multi-objective optimization, and compare their performance to other optimization methods. The research will also explore the use of GNNs for other types of applications, such as natural language processing or computer vision, and compare their performance to other machine learning methods. Additionally, the research will develop a new GNN architecture that incorporates both position-aware and distance-weighted aggregation for improved predictive performance on graph-based tasks. The research will investigate the use of GNNs for other types of prediction tasks, such as time-series forecasting or anomaly detection, and compare their performance to other prediction methods. Furthermore, the research will explicitly account for the uncertainty in the graph structure in new methods for training GNNs to improve their robustness. Lastly, the research will investigate the use of GNNs for other types of graph-based tasks, such as graph classification, and compare their performance to other graph classification methods.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The proposed research is comprehensive and covers a wide range\nHere is the strength of the submission:  of topics related to GNNs and their applications to machine learning tasks.\n* The proposed benchmarking framework can help researchers and practitioners to compare and select the most appropriate GNN architecture for their specific tasks.\n* The investigation of P-GNNs and ID-GNNs can improve the expressive power of other GNN architectures and enhance their performance on various machine learning tasks.\n* The application of GNNs to dynamic graphs, hypergraphs, time-series data, and text data can expand their applicability to new domains.\n* The development of new training methods, such as DiffQAS, can improve the performance and robustness of GNN models.\n* The exploration of new applications and prediction tasks can contribute to the advancement of the field of GNNs.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* The lack of novelty in proposing a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating GNN architectures.\n* The proposed research is overambitious and covers a wide range of topics, which may benefit from focusing on a few specific areas and providing a more in-depth analysis.\n* The insufficient detail on the methodology of the proposed research, such as the datasets, evaluation metrics, and specifics of the new GNN architecture.\n* The limited context on the current state of the field and the lack of a comprehensive review of the literature.\n* The lack of empirical evaluation of the proposed research, such as preliminary results or simulations.\n* The unclear relation to the two related papers mentioned in the summary.\n* The lack of explicit mention of the contributions beyond the state-of-the-art and how the proposed research will advance the field of GNNs.\n\nTo address these weaknesses, we recommend the following revisions:\n\n1.

    - "Decision: Reject\n\nAfter careful consideration of the submission, reviews, and rebuttals, the decision is to reject this submission. The main reason for rejection is the lack of novelty and the overly ambitious scope of the proposed research. The submission does not provide a clear and unique contribution to the field of graph neural networks, and the proposed research covers a wide range of topics without providing sufficient detail on the methodology or empirical evaluation.\n\nTo improve the submission, we recommend focusing on a few specific areas of research and providing a more in-depth analysis, developing novel evaluation metrics or testing on new datasets, and providing more detail on the methodology of the proposed research, such as the datasets, evaluation metrics, and specifics of the new GNN architecture. Additionally, including preliminary results or simulations to demonstrate the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed research, clearly explaining how the proposed research relates to the related work, and explicitly mentioning the contributions beyond the state-of-the-art and how the proposed research will advance the field of GNNs would strengthen the submission."
