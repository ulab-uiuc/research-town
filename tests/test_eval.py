    research_trend = "The current research trend in foundation models (FMs) involves developing large models that are pretrained on extensive datasets and then adapted for various downstream tasks. These FMs are primarily based on sequence models, which process sequences of inputs across different domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics. The predominant architecture for these models is the Transformer, which utilizes self-attention mechanisms. The strength of self-attention lies in its ability to handle complex data by routing information densely within a context window. However, this comes with significant limitations: difficulty in modeling outside of a finite context window and quadratic scaling with respect to window length.\n Efforts to create more efficient variants of attention have been extensive but often compromise the effectiveness that self-attention provides. As a result, no alternative has yet matched the empirical success of Transformers across various domains.Recently, structured state space models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising alternative. These models combine elements of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), drawing from classical state space models. SSMs can be computed efficiently, either as recurrences or convolutions, and they scale linearly or near-linearly with sequence length. They also have mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies, particularly excelling in benchmarks like the Long Range Arena.\nDifferent variants of SSMs have been successful in continuous signal data domains such as audio and vision. However, they have not been as effective in handling discrete and information-dense data, such as text, highlighting an area for further research and development."

    paper_abstract = "Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5X higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation."
