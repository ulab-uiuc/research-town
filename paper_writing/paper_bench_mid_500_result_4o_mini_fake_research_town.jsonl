Furthermore, the need for gauge invariance in lattice gauge theories adds complexity, as generative models must respect the symmetries of the underlying physical systems.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nWhile there has been progress in applying normalizing flows for density estimation and generative modeling, significant gaps remain in their application to lattice gauge theories.

Additionally, prior work has often overlooked the importance of training flows to directly sample from the desired Boltzmann distribution, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nWe propose to develop a novel flow-based generative model specifically designed for lattice gauge theories, integrating normalizing flows with Monte Carlo methods. Our approach will involve training the model on the lattice action to approximate the desired Boltzmann distribution while ensuring gauge invariance. We will evaluate performance using benchmark datasets from lattice field theories, measuring metrics such as acceptance rates and autocorrelation times.

By addressing fairness, we can mitigate discrimination against marginalized groups and promote ethical AI practices. This research could establish new benchmarks for fairness in graph-based learning and inspire future studies on fairness across various machine learning paradigms, ultimately fostering trust in AI systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge of ensuring fairness in GNNs arises from the non-IID nature of graph data, which complicates the application of traditional fairness metrics.
