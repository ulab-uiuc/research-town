Developing methods that allow models to retain knowledge from previous tasks while adapting to new ones can lead to more robust and flexible AI systems. This research has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models, enabling them to operate in dynamic environments where data distributions change over time. Additionally, solving this problem could inspire new methodologies in related fields, such as transfer learning and multi-task learning, broadening the impact of this research across the AI community.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge of catastrophic forgetting stems from the nature of neural networks, which often overwrite previously learned information when exposed to new data. Balancing stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (adapting to new information) creates a stability-plasticity dilemma that is difficult to navigate. Existing methods, such as rehearsal-based approaches and regularization techniques, face limitations in scalability and adaptability, often requiring extensive memory or failing to capture the nuances of task relationships.

Our approach differs by introducing the KoLA benchmark, which incorporates a four-level taxonomy, a diverse dataset that includes emerging knowledge, and a contrastive evaluation system, addressing the limitations of prior work.\n\n[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?  \nOur proposed methodology involves constructing the KoLA benchmark, which includes a four-level taxonomy of knowledge-related abilities, utilizing both Wikipedia and continuously collected emerging corpora for evaluation, and implementing a contrastive evaluation system with standard scores and a self-contrast metric. We plan to evaluate 28 open-source and commercial LLMs using this framework. The expected outcomes include a clearer understanding of LLM capabilities, identification of knowledge gaps, and a dynamic assessment tool that evolves with new information, updated every three months.", "gen_proposal": "### Consolidated Research Proposal\n\n**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**  \nHow can we effectively enhance the factual accuracy and coherence of language model outputs in open-domain question answering tasks, particularly in the presence of dynamic and evolving knowledge, while minimizing the occurrence of hallucinations?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**  \nAddressing this problem is crucial for advancing natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) as it directly impacts the reliability of AI systems in real-world applications such as customer support, education, and healthcare. Improving the factual accuracy and coherence of language models will enhance user trust and satisfaction, leading to broader adoption of AI technologies. Furthermore, this research could pave the way for future advancements in knowledge integration and reasoning capabilities, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and intelligent AI systems capable of human-like understanding and interaction.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \nThe challenge lies in the inherent limitations of current language models, which often generate outputs that are factually incorrect or lack coherence due to their reliance on static training data. Existing models struggle with integrating real-time knowledge and reasoning over multiple sources, leading to hallucinations and irrelevant responses. Naive approaches, such as simply increasing model size or retraining on larger datasets, may not address the underlying issues of knowledge retrieval and contextual understanding. Additionally, the complexity of multi-turn dialogue and the need for models to maintain coherence over extended interactions further complicate the task.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**  \nPrevious research has primarily focused on improving model architectures and training methodologies without adequately addressing the integration of external knowledge and the dynamic nature of factual information. Many existing solutions rely on static datasets that do not reflect real-world complexities, leading to outdated or incorrect outputs. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate both factual accuracy and coherence has hindered progress in this area. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by proposing a unified framework that combines real-time knowledge retrieval with advanced reasoning techniques, thus enhancing the overall performance of language models in open-domain question answering tasks.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**  \nWe propose a hybrid model that integrates a large pre-trained language model with a dynamic knowledge retrieval system, allowing for real-time access to up-to-date information from external knowledge bases. The methodology will involve training the model on a diverse dataset that includes both static and dynamic knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia and real-time news articles. We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics that assess both factual accuracy and coherence, such as MAUVE and human evaluations. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in hallucinations and an improvement in the relevance and coherence of generated responses, thereby setting a new standard for open-domain question answering systems. This research aims to contribute to the development of more reliable and context-aware language models, ultimately enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.", "bleu": 0.19754556629759892, "rouge_l": 0.30648769574944074, "gpt_metric_score": 0.5, "bert_score": 0.24692201614379883, "openai_sim": 0.7385247994621051, "voyageai_sim": 0.7169510440210864, "openai_sim_q1": 0.5686292384724422, "openai_sim_q2": 0.6660009597446069, "openai_sim_q3": 0.6249774330141373, "openai_sim_q4": 0.6272395160549727, "openai_sim_q5": 0.6162946983492412, "voyageai_sim_q1": 0.7976496187529626, "voyageai_sim_q2": 0.6804254275039746, "voyageai_sim_q3": 0.6097175395576558, "voyageai_sim_q4": 0.7079813209789032, "voyageai_sim_q5": 0.6868077672699017, "bertscore_q1": 0.36111128330230713, "bertscore_q2": 0.2866089344024658, "bertscore_q3": 0.23495405912399292, "bertscore_q4": 0.305766224861145, "bertscore_q5": 0.1356639862060547}
