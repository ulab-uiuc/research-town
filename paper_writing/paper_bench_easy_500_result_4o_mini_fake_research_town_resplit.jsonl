This could pave the way for safer AI systems, fostering trust in AI technologies and enabling their broader adoption across various industries.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nMitigating the backdoor effect is challenging due to the sophisticated nature of backdoor attacks, which can involve subtle manipulations of the training data that are difficult to detect. Naive approaches may fail because they might not adequately differentiate between clean and poisoned data, leading to the retention of the backdoor while compromising the model's performance on clean inputs. Additionally, the need to balance the removal of the backdoor with the preservation of model accuracy introduces significant technical and practical complexities.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on identifying backdoor attacks rather than developing effective post-training defenses.

By integrating video generation and recognition, this research could lead to significant improvements in video understanding tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings could inspire future research directions in generative models and their applications in various domains, such as video analysis, content creation, and interactive media, ultimately enhancing the practical utility of diffusion models in real-world applications.\n\n### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe challenge lies in the distinct training and inference processes of video generation and recognition models. Video diffusion models are optimized using corrupted inputs and single conditioning frames, while recognition models require clean inputs and multiple frames to understand temporal relationships. This discrepancy creates a significant training-inference gap, making it difficult to jointly optimize for both tasks without compromising performance. Naive approaches that treat diffusion models as frozen feature extractors or deconstruct them for new tasks often fail to retain their generative capabilities, leading to suboptimal results.\n\n### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either using diffusion models as static feature extractors or adapting them for new tasks at the expense of their generative abilities. The lack of a unified framework that accommodates the unique requirements of both video generation and recognition has hindered progress. Additionally, existing methods have not effectively addressed the training-inference gap, which has prevented the exploration of the full potential of video diffusion models in understanding tasks.
